<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.61" data-timestamp="0.61">OK. So let's all just pause here for a second for something that is so rare on public radio or, you know, I guess, anywhere, actually. Let's pause for something that everyone can agree on. Something that doesn't divide Republicans and Democrats, Sunni and Shia, Taylor Swift fans and Katy Perry fans.</p><p begin="00:00:16.77" data-timestamp="16.77">This something that I found like that everybody can agree on is a graphic. It's a graphic that somebody showed me on the internet. It's an optical illusion created by a professor at MIT who studies vision and the brain.</p><p begin="00:00:28.04" data-timestamp="28.04">And basically, there are two gray boxes. One of them is surrounded by lighter stuff so it looks darker, and the other gray box is surrounded by darker stuff so it looks lighter. But in fact, the whole point of it is it's an optical illusion. The two gray squares are exactly the same shade of gray.</p><p begin="00:00:46.06" data-timestamp="46.06">Now, that's just a fact. But of course, since this graphic is on the internet, there's a comment section. And you might think, what would you possibly comment on? Right?</p><p begin="00:00:53.74" data-timestamp="53.74">It doesn't seem like there's anything, really, here to discuss. Gray is gray. And I'll refrain from a <i>Fifty</i> <i>Shades</i> <i>of</i> <i>Gray</i> joke here and just say, when you scroll down through the comments, people do find a way to disagree, even about this.</p><p begin="00:01:07.75" data-timestamp="67.75">And I don't know, maybe you've been on the internet-- they like to curse about it. One person writes, "what a load of shit. They are different colors." Another writes, "not the same [BEEP] shade." Says a third, "not convinced."</p><p begin="00:01:26.74" data-timestamp="86.74">Then people start in with advice. And at first, they're like, super nice about it, right? They're trying to be helpful. They tell the doubters to take their fingers and cover over everything but the two gray squares on their screen and they'll see they are the same color.</p><p begin="00:01:41.71" data-timestamp="101.71">Several people suggested they can open up the file on Photoshop or MS Paint and use the Dropper tool to see the exact RGB values of the colors and they'll see that they're the same. By the way, 120, 120, 120 with 160 hue, 113 loom.</p><p begin="00:01:57.85" data-timestamp="117.85">After all of that, somebody still writes, "The second square looks brighter to me." Somebody else replies, "It's definitely brighter than you." People start calling each other stupid, which of course leads to the kind of big, overbroad, sweeping statement you see in comment sections everywhere. Quote, "If after reading this thread, you refuse to actually test it and choose to stick with your dogmatic belief, then you are everything that is wrong with America."</p><p begin="00:02:30.61" data-timestamp="150.61">You know, I think we're all so used to all kinds of ugliness online in comment sections and Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else. At this point, most of us don't even give it a second thought. And so today on our radio show, we decided, well, let's give it a second thought.</p><p begin="00:02:43.95" data-timestamp="163.95">Let's dive into the bile. Let's dive into the hate and look around and see whatever we can understand. Let's ask the dumbest questions. Like, why so mad? And if you are so mad, why go to the trouble to tell strangers how mad you are?</p><p begin="00:03:01.34" data-timestamp="181.34">From WBEZ Chicago, this is an hour of stories with some very upset, anonymous people who we get to know a little bit. It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Ask Not For Whom The Bell Trolls; It Trolls for Thee</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:17.31" data-timestamp="197.31">Act one, "Ask Not for Whom the Bell Trolls. It Trolls for Thee." Let's begin with the worst case scenario of things that can happen on the internet with a troll. In fact, a kind of exceptional troll. Trolls, of course, are people who post hate and abuse online. They use comments sections in social media to hound people and shriek at people.</p><p begin="00:03:38.08" data-timestamp="218.08">Studies show that both men and women are harassed online, but women get way more malicious messages. And they're way more likely to be stalked online or sexually harassed. Lindy West is a writer who's written for a lot of places like <i>Jezebel</i> and <i>GQ</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i>. Her work is online, so she is very familiar with internet trolls and she has our story.</p><p begin="00:03:56.85" data-timestamp="236.85">Quick warning to podcast listeners. From this point forward, we are not going to beep anything in today's show. If you prefer a beeped version of our show, you can find that at our website, thisamericanlife.org. Here's Lindy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lindy West</h4><p begin="00:04:08.20" data-timestamp="248.2">One midsummer afternoon in 2013, I got a message on Twitter from my dead dad. I don't remember what it said exactly and I didn't keep a copy for my scrapbook, but it was mean. And my dad was never mean, so it couldn't really be from him. Also, he was dead.</p><p begin="00:04:27.55" data-timestamp="267.55">Just 18 months earlier, I'd watched him turn gray and drown in his own lungs. So I was, like, 80% sure. And I don't believe in heaven. And even if I did, I'd hope to god they don't have fucking Twitter there. It's heaven. Go play chocolate badminton on a cloud with Jerry Orbach and your childhood cat.</p><p begin="00:04:52.27" data-timestamp="292.27">But there was a message. Some context. In the summer of 2013, in certain circles of the internet, comedians and feminists were at war over rape jokes. Being both a comedy writer and a committed feminist killjoy, I weighed in with an article in which I said that I think a lot of male comedians are careless with the subject of rape.</p><p begin="00:05:16.93" data-timestamp="316.93">Here's just a sample of the responses I got on social media. A quick warning-- these are internet comments about rape, so it's going to suck. "I love how the bitch complaining about rape is the exact kind of bitch that would never be raped." "Holes like this make me want to commit rape out of anger." "I just want to rape her with a traffic cone."</p><p begin="00:05:41.83" data-timestamp="341.83">"No one would want to rape that fat, disgusting mess." "Kill yourself." "I want to put an apple into that mouth of yours and take a huge stick and slide it through your body and roast you." "That big bitch is bitter that no one wants to rape her."</p><p begin="00:05:58.69" data-timestamp="358.69">It went on like that for weeks. It's something I'm used to. I have to be. Being insulted and threatened online is part of my job, which is not to say it doesn't hurt. It does. It feels, well, exactly like you'd imagine it would feel to have someone call you a fat cunt every day of your life.</p><p begin="00:06:22.63" data-timestamp="382.63">When I got that message from my dad, it was well into rape joke summer. I was eating 30 rape threats for breakfast at that point. Or more accurately, "you're fatter than the girls I usually rape" threats. And I thought I was coping. But if you get a blade sharp enough, it'll cut through anything.</p><p begin="00:06:46.57" data-timestamp="406.57">The account was called PawWestDonezo. Paw West because his name was Paul West. And Donezo because, I guess, he was done. He was done being alive, done doing crossword puzzles, done forcing me to sing duets at dinner parties. Done writing little poems on the back of every receipt. Done being my dad.</p><p begin="00:07:12.30" data-timestamp="432.3">The little bio on Twitter read, "embarrassed father of an idiot." Other two kids are fine, though. His location-- dirt hole in Seattle. The profile photo was a familiar picture of him. He's sitting at his piano smiling in the living room of the house where I grew up.</p><p begin="00:07:31.84" data-timestamp="451.84">The day they sold that house, when I was 25, I sat on the stairs and sobbed harder than I ever had before. Because a place is kind of like a person, you know? It felt like death. I wouldn't cry that hard again until December 12, 2011, when I'd learn that a place is not like a person at all. Only a person is a person. Only a death is really a death.</p><p begin="00:08:04.39" data-timestamp="484.39">My dad lost consciousness on a Saturday night. That afternoon, when we could feel his lucidity slipping, we called my brother in Boston. You were such a special little boy, he said. I love you very much. He didn't say very many things after that. I would give anything for one more sentence. I would give anything for 140 more characters.</p><p begin="00:08:35.67" data-timestamp="515.67">The person who made the PawWestDonezo account clearly put some time into it. They'd researched my father and my family. They'd found out his name.</p><p begin="00:08:44.17" data-timestamp="524.17">And then they figured out which Paul West he was among all the Paul Wests on the internet. They knew that I have a brother and a sister. And if they knew all that, they must have known how recently we'd lost my dad.</p><p begin="00:08:59.20" data-timestamp="539.2">Conventional wisdom says never feed the trolls. Don't respond. It's what they want. I do that. It doesn't help.</p><p begin="00:09:08.10" data-timestamp="548.1">I could just stop reading comments altogether, but sometimes I get threatening ones. Like the other day, someone said I should get Charlie Hebdoed. Colleagues of mine have had their addresses published online, had trolls actually show up in person at their public events. If I don't read comments, how will I know when they've crossed the line?</p><p begin="00:09:28.54" data-timestamp="568.54">I could just stop writing altogether. I've thought about it. But it seems to me that our silence is what the trolls want.</p><p begin="00:09:42.34" data-timestamp="582.34">Faced with PawWestDonezo, I was stuck with the question, what should I do? If I respond, I'm a sucker. But if I don't respond, I'm a punching bag.</p><p begin="00:09:53.09" data-timestamp="593.09">So I did what you're not supposed to do. I fed the troll. I wrote about PawWestDonezo in an article for Jezebel.com. I wrote sadly, candidly, angrily about how much it hurt. How much that troll had succeeded.</p><p begin="00:10:09.59" data-timestamp="609.59">And then something amazing happened. The morning after that post went up, I got an email. "Hey, Lindy, I don't know why or even when I started trolling you. It wasn't because of your stance on rape jokes.

A reporter wrote a story about that study at the website of <i>Science</i> <i>Magazine</i>. <i>Gawker</i>, <i>Huffington</i> <i>Post</i>, <i>Boing</i> <i>Boing</i>, and other sites linked to it. And within days, it became the most popular article ever published on the <i>Science</i> <i>Magazine</i> website and its 15 years.

And like a lot of the other coverage, <i>The</i> <i>Today</i> <i>Show</i> story pathologizes vocal fry-- says that it's some kind of problem instead of just the way that some people talk. And it teaches viewers to spot it. <i>Today</i> <i>Show</i> host Matt Lauer starts a segment saying that he's never heard of this and ends it saying he'd never noticed it before and now he's going to be on the alert for it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Nancy Snyderman</h4><p begin="00:29:58.60" data-timestamp="1798.6">That's it.

But as a linguist at the University of Pennsylvania, Mark Lieberman, has pointed out, there is still no evidence of that-- pro or con. No evidence that it is more common now than it's always been.</p><p begin="00:30:22.91" data-timestamp="1822.91">What's striking in the dozens of emails about vocal fry that we've gotten here at our radio show is how vehement people are. These are some of the angriest emails we ever get. They call these women's voices unbearable, excruciating, annoyingly adolescent, beyond annoying, difficult to pay attention. So severe as to cause discomfort.</p><p begin="00:30:41.70" data-timestamp="1841.7">Can't stand the pain, distractingly disgusting. Could not get over how annoyed I was. I am so appalled.

And she thought, well, she shouldn't be on NPR. She doesn't sound authoritative.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Penny Eckert</h4><p begin="00:33:35.52" data-timestamp="2015.52">When I played it for my students and asked them how they thought she sounded, they said she sounded great.

Then I knew that I was behind the curve.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:45.58" data-timestamp="2025.58">So she did a little study-- a preliminary study. She played clips of a <i>Marketplace</i> reporter named Sally Herships for 584 people. And she asked them to rate how authoritative the reporter sounded. The results-- people under 40 heard it very differently than people over 40.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Penny Eckert</h4><p begin="00:34:02.65" data-timestamp="2042.65">The younger people found that quite authoritative and the older people did not.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:07.12" data-timestamp="2047.12">So if people are having a problem with these reporters on the radio, what it means is they're old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Penny Eckert</h4><p begin="00:34:14.92" data-timestamp="2054.92">Yeah.

I mean, I'm constantly getting requests from media.</p><p begin="00:34:25.87" data-timestamp="2065.87">And they want to talk about the crazy ways that young women are speaking. And the first thing they do is attribute it to young women, even though young men are doing it, too. So that's why-- it's a policing of young people, but I think, most particularly, young women.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:42.14" data-timestamp="2082.14">She says the same thing happened with upspeak and with the word like.

<h3>Act Three: Words of Prey</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:43.48" data-timestamp="2143.48">Act three, "Words of Prey." So every few months, it seems there's some study that gets released saying that something like 15% of the internet is just cats-- cat videos, cat pictures. Or maybe it's 1% is cats or maybe it's some other number that really just seems crazy.</p><p begin="00:35:58.87" data-timestamp="2158.87">My point is the internet loves animals. With that in mind, here's Jonathan Menjivar with this story that we first broadcast a year ago.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:36:07.00" data-timestamp="2167">In the world of wildlife animal cams, the Woods Hole Osprey cam is a bit player. It's certainly no Panda Cam. All over the Earth, there are web cams trained on bison, penguins-- I just watched a jellyfish one that's useful if you want to feel stoned at your desk.</p><p begin="00:36:22.27" data-timestamp="2182.27">But until last summer, the Osprey Cam at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-- most people just call it WHOI-- their camera didn't get much traffic. The cam was started about a decade ago as a kind of pet project of a woman who worked at WHOI. She died in 2009.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:36:37.94" data-timestamp="2197.94">Her name was Sherri and she was deeply involved in the Osprey. Loved animals.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:36:43.78" data-timestamp="2203.78">This is Jeffrey Brodeur. He works at WHOI.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:36:46.15" data-timestamp="2206.15">And in fact, we named one of the osprey after her, which-- one of the worst parts was that the bird we named got hit by a car. The bird died and then, that winter, she died.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:37:03.55" data-timestamp="2223.55">Sherri was only 41. After her death, Jeffrey took over responsibility for the camera. And for three years, no bird showed up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:37:11.95" data-timestamp="2231.95">Kind of this empty pallor hung over this nest for a while, where season after season, we didn't have anything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:37:20.13" data-timestamp="2240.13">One year, a male and female showed up. But they didn't breed. They returned a year later. And on April 19, 2014, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the first egg arrived. At least, that's according to one account on a message board. Excitement around the nest grew on the internet. Then a second egg arrived, and then a third.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:37:41.32" data-timestamp="2261.32">Right. Which is amazing. So people were really starting to kind of sit up and pay attention that the Woods Hole Osprey Nest is back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:37:51.98" data-timestamp="2271.98">Featherheads-- that's apparently what some osprey addicts call themselves. They started putting videos on YouTube and posting play-by-play action of everything that was happening in the nest. 5:44 AM-- "Two minutes into fourth video and it's looking very much like a normal feeding." 5:45 AM-- "All three are clustered around and I think at least two are being fed. I also think the one on the left isn't getting as much now as the one that was fed more earlier." 5:46 AM-- "Adult paused for a second and looked around."</p><p begin="00:38:28.47" data-timestamp="2308.47">On the message boards, people started posting screenshots of things they were seeing-- when the nestlings ate, when they pooped. So all these eyes were on the nest. People were excited. And then--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:38:40.57" data-timestamp="2320.57">It was almost immediate that people started noticing that things were not quite normal in this nest.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:38:48.70" data-timestamp="2328.7">The mom-- she'd bring fish to the nest, but she seemed to be hoarding them, not sharing with the nestlings.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:38:55.18" data-timestamp="2335.18">And then they're starting to ask about the mother. And what kind of behavior is the mother displaying? She seems not to be feeding as much. And she's kind of not interacting with the babies. And then it all blew up when she started attacking the young.</p><p begin="00:39:24.17" data-timestamp="2364.17">I heard from someone that she was, quote, unquote, "ripping apart the young." She was pecking-- pecking at their heads. She was using her talons, kind of-- imagine almost like a helicopter. She's hovered over these three young, who are putting their heads down, tucking their necks down to protect themselves from her as she just starts clawing away and pecking at them-- going for the eyes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:39:51.29" data-timestamp="2391.29">Now, if this happened in a forest, it's just another day for nature. But it wasn't happening in a forest. It was happening on the internet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:39:59.19" data-timestamp="2399.19">And from that point on, it was Momzilla. That was the name they gave her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:40:11.40" data-timestamp="2411.4">I've watched the videos and they are hard to take. It's not a lion taking down a gazelle because he's hungry. This is a mother attacking her kids, seemingly for no reason. And not just attacking them-- starving them. When the dad brings fish to the nest, the mother often eats most of the fish before she offers the nestlings anything.</p><p begin="00:40:32.88" data-timestamp="2432.88">By the end of the summer, a message board devoted to the cam that had been quiet for years suddenly had hundreds of pages of posts. There are at least 40 osprey cams around the US. And now, Jeffrey was sitting on the <i>Real</i> <i>Housewives</i> of osprey cams. Woods Hole had the train wreck that everyone wanted to watch.</p><p begin="00:40:49.86" data-timestamp="2449.86">People on the message boards clearly knew a ton about osprey, but they couldn't help themselves from attaching human motives to the mother's actions. One person wrote, "Note how she looks at them at times, almost like daring them to move."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:41:02.75" data-timestamp="2462.75">So here's one from a little bit later in July. "Please. I just watched a YouTube video that's shown this mom osprey attacking all her babies, one very viciously. This is not normal. I have seen normal osprey moms to be loving and worried for their babies.</p><p begin="00:41:20.69" data-timestamp="2480.69">Please remove these babies now. Give them a chance to know that this is not normal. Please get these babies off this nest. Please."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:41:30.25" data-timestamp="2490.25">That's a lot of pleases in there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:41:31.48" data-timestamp="2491.48">And I got-- yeah. And I got a lot similar to that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:41:39.03" data-timestamp="2499.03">A poster on July 10 wrote, "I wish someone would listen to me already. I think this is not their parent. That is why she is attacking them and there has been no food delivery. The same thing happened with a bald eagle nest in Shepherdtown, Virginia." They mean Shepherdstown, West Virginia.</p><p begin="00:41:54.56" data-timestamp="2514.56">"The intruder does not want them. So someone needs to contact Cape Cod Wildlife and give them a heads up or you may have three chicks that perish. If you guys won't, I will."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:42:05.14" data-timestamp="2525.14">And that became the question that everyone was asking-- are you going to somehow remove these birds from their nest?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:42:18.95" data-timestamp="2538.95">Jeffrey is not an osprey expert. He does outreach for WHOI. And at WHOI, they study ocean life, not birds. So Jeffrey consulted osprey experts around the country and they all told him two things.</p><p begin="00:42:31.97" data-timestamp="2551.97">One, they'd never seen an osprey behave this way before. And two, the experts agreed that Jeffrey and WHOI should not intervene. Don't give the nestlings food. Don't remove them. WHOI didn't have any place to put them, anyhow, and ospreys do terribly in captivity.</p><p begin="00:42:49.49" data-timestamp="2569.49">Jeffrey let the message boards know all this. But some featherheads still called for WHOI to intervene. Especially once the nestlings got hungry enough that they started attacking each other, fighting over food.</p><p begin="00:43:02.06" data-timestamp="2582.06">People wanted answers and they started theorizing. There had been big storms in the area that could have made it hard to find fish. Maybe three nestlings was just too much for the mom to handle and she was stressed out. Maybe it was the dad. Maybe he was stepping out on Momzilla and working another nest on the side.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:43:19.40" data-timestamp="2599.4">Well, the funny thing was that when I took some of the theories to the osprey experts, they were like, well, that's a possibility. Throw it in the mix because it certainly can't be ruled out. And it was everything from bad DNA to toxicology. Had she maybe, somehow, ingested toxins somewhere along the way?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:43:48.96" data-timestamp="2628.96">Now, imagine being Jeffrey. You're a communications guy at this place that doesn't even specialize in birds. Then your co-worker dies and you take over this bird cam that was dear to her.</p><p begin="00:43:59.66" data-timestamp="2639.66">And before you know it, people from all over the world are mad at you and demanding action. Jeffrey-- he's a nice guy, diplomatic. The most I could get out of him was that he was frustrated over all this.</p><p begin="00:44:11.54" data-timestamp="2651.54">But at the time, Jeffrey phoned one of the webcam viewers, who then posted this on the message board. Quote, "Jeff Brodeur just called me. Called, not emailed.</p><p begin="00:44:21.65" data-timestamp="2661.65">He is furious. He's been getting tons of nasty threatening emails from cam viewers demanding the chicks or female be removed from the nest. Someone sent out an email to the entire staff saying they are inhumane. Jeff is going to shut the cam off if the emails don't stop."</p><p begin="00:44:38.17" data-timestamp="2678.17">Jeffrey didn't shut the cam off, but he posted a warning to viewers that they might see behavior they'd find upsetting. If they don't like it, he thought, they could just stop watching.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:44:48.02" data-timestamp="2688.02">I mean, not only did people not stop watching it when things got rough, they kind of encouraged others to start watching.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:44:54.41" data-timestamp="2694.41">And then things really blew up when one of the nestlings got its talon caught on a balloon string that was in the nest. Now the nestling was even more vulnerable to the mother's attacks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:45:06.38" data-timestamp="2706.38">Every single email I got-- I tried for a while to answer back personally and respond. But then, it just got so overwhelming that I couldn't even really begin to. And it even went over to my vacation in late July.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:45:22.91" data-timestamp="2722.91">Jeffrey was with his whole family on Martha's Vineyard and his phone rang.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:45:26.84" data-timestamp="2726.84">And I stepped outside on the front lawn. The person on the other end-- they told me I was evil because I hadn't done anything. And you know, I slipped for-- I had a momentary lapse of reason in which I said to this person-- I said, ma'am, I'm on vacation with my family. And there was this pause. And that's pretty much when she just laid into me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:45:58.52" data-timestamp="2758.52">The woman told him, osprey in need don't get vacations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:46:08.72" data-timestamp="2768.72">Finally, someone wrote me an email that just-- that was the last straw.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:46:15.35" data-timestamp="2775.35">So this happens at the end of July. And can you just read that email for me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:46:20.90" data-timestamp="2780.9">Sure. "I am witnessing an ongoing attack by the female osprey. It is intensely disturbing. The proper authorities need to take immediate action. I believe this female osprey has a serious problem and should be humanely and permanently removed from the gene pool."</p><p begin="00:46:40.23" data-timestamp="2800.23">And so I got that email and I remember taking a minute to digest that. I just couldn't believe that what I thought someone was asking me in that email-- telling me to basically go up and wring its little osprey neck. You know, euthanize the bird.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:47:00.42" data-timestamp="2820.42">So later that same day, you post something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:47:03.87" data-timestamp="2823.87">Yeah. So that afternoon, I posted what I called Final Word on Intervention.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:47:10.35" data-timestamp="2830.35">And then, if you could just read a little bit of this for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:47:14.83" data-timestamp="2834.83">"Where do I even begin? I guess with the obvious. We're not going to do any osprey executions anytime soon.</p><p begin="00:47:22.39" data-timestamp="2842.39">This person said it was intensely disturbing to watch the attacks and I couldn't agree more. Try having it happen right outside your window with sound. Even if the windows are closed, it can reach disturbing decibels. They're at it right now, in fact.</p><p begin="00:47:38.61" data-timestamp="2858.61">I literally turn to my left and see the nest, and I count that as a blessing, not a curse. But I get it, really. I also understand that you get attached the birds. Want to get attached to them?"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:47:49.56" data-timestamp="2869.56">Jeffrey wrote that he was attached to them, too. Partly because he misses the woman who helped start the cam and who ran it until she died at 41. Every time he sees the birds, he wrote, he thinks of her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Brodeur</h4><p begin="00:48:02.29" data-timestamp="2882.29">"I know she would be upset at what's going on. And trust me, no one misses her more during this deluge of emails, calls, tweets, et cetera, than me. But she certainly wouldn't even consider what was suggested and neither will we. I take great solace in the wisdom of others involved in the world of Osprey Cam. And I'm happy to count the good folks at Montana Osprey Project in Missoula among those.</p><p begin="00:48:24.96" data-timestamp="2904.96">Here, in part, is what they've posted about their cam. "Ospreys are wild birds. They are not pets and this is not a Disney movie. What comes with this is the good and, sometimes, the sad. To put things in perspective, it is estimated that about 50% to 60% of all osprey chicks do not survive their first year of life."</p><p begin="00:48:45.18" data-timestamp="2925.18">We will strive to keep you informed. We will strive to keep things on the nest positive. What we won't do is take nature into our own hands because some people find it tough to watch."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Menjivar</h4><p begin="00:48:59.32" data-timestamp="2939.32">That sort of worked. Most of the featherheads stopped their chirping. The mother kept attacking the nestlings and they continued to attack each other. By the end of the summer, all three learned to fly and left the nest. One was found dead underneath a nearby tree. He was malnourished.</p><p begin="00:49:18.30" data-timestamp="2958.3">An osprey expert told me, nature is not cruel. That implies intent. It is harsh, unforgiving, and often random. Most of the Osprey Cam viewers knew all that. But still, it's hard not to view animals-- any animals-- through a human lens.</p><p begin="00:49:36.12" data-timestamp="2976.12">As one person posted, "Well, I'm one to humanize. I admit it. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I have human sympathies for the little one-- fledgling number three-- and I don't mind sharing that. Some have expressed their feelings about mom's attacks. We are humans, after all.</p><p begin="00:49:53.80" data-timestamp="2993.8">I've seen fledgling two go after fledgling three many times and would like to reach in and slap him upside the head. That is me humanizing the situation as it happens. Obviously, I can't do that, but I sure feel it. Yes, my posts have lots of humanizing. I'm human. I'm not afraid to show it."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:22.11" data-timestamp="3022.11">Jonathan Menjivar. He's one of the producers of our program.</p><p begin="00:50:34.46" data-timestamp="3034.46">Well, this hour we've been hearing stories of people getting insulted and harassed in various ways on the internet. But can internet hate ever be helpful to a person? There's a new podcast called "Reply All." It spends a lot of time living among the haters and the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world on the internet. And one of the hosts of the podcast "Reply All," PJ Vogt, has this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:50:55.79" data-timestamp="3055.79">Ignore whatever good things seem to be going on in your life. You're lousy, you're an imposter, and everybody in your life knows it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:51:02.50" data-timestamp="3062.5">I mean, it's the same little voice all the time. This little guy just sitting there, going like, god, you're trash, you're garbage, you're garbage, you're garbage. I don't know why he sounds like a Brooklyn construction worker, but he does right now, today.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:51:14.33" data-timestamp="3074.33">That voice told Paul that his life, which looked-- from the outside-- pretty normal, was teetering on the edge of a huge disaster.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:51:21.16" data-timestamp="3081.16">I actually had two little children screaming at home and they were making me worried. And in just all the regular ways that kids make you worried. And I was not finishing a bunch of projects. I was feeling really at loose ends. And I was stressed and I was anxious and overweight and terrified. And I was just like, holy shit, I got to do better.</p><p begin="00:51:46.40" data-timestamp="3106.4">And then the anxiety would be like, oh, hey, wow. I'm dying. No, wait. I'm covered with worms. No, I'm never going to get anything done. I'm a bad person. I'm a failure.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:51:58.12" data-timestamp="3118.12">Paul programmed software and so he decided what he needed to do about his anxiety was to treat it like an IT problem that needed troubleshooting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:52:05.74" data-timestamp="3125.74">For me, it was just like, what is this weird force that is now running a chunk of my life and making me feel weird and bad all the time? And so I went off and I made this thing called Anxiety Box.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:52:19.23" data-timestamp="3139.23">Anxiety Box. It's a website. Paul's technological solution to the self-doubting criticism swirling around in his head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:52:26.86" data-timestamp="3146.86">So the way it works-- if we look at the website. You go to the website and you put in your name and your email. And then you put in what your anxiety is. So it's like, I'm really anxious about finishing my book. I'm really anxious about losing weight. And you can keep adding anxieties.</p><p begin="00:52:41.41" data-timestamp="3161.41">And it saves all of that to a database. And then, like 12 times a day-- but kind of random-- it just sends you these emails from your anxiety.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:52:51.40" data-timestamp="3171.4">Not emails soothing you about your anxiety. Emails that are actually sent from a personified version of your anxiety that lived on a website. Paul coded in all these tiny sentence fragments that the website could use to automatically construct emails.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:53:04.81" data-timestamp="3184.81">All these various kind of pseudo parts of speech like, the upshot is, tell me, drop a line, keep me in the loop. I don't want to doubt you, but, or I doubt it can ever work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:53:16.00" data-timestamp="3196">Those sound fragments were meant to give his robot the perfect voice-- the voice of a ruthlessly cheerful underminer. An underminer who knew his specific anxieties-- the work deadlines he was blowing, the weight he couldn't seem to lose-- and could taunt him about them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:53:28.63" data-timestamp="3208.63">So let's imagine that I'm standing on the train. I'm about to go down into the train platform. And like, I look at my phone and I have an email and it's from my anxiety. I mean, here's an email from June 2, in the afternoon.</p><p begin="00:53:42.71" data-timestamp="3222.71">Here's the subject. "History will forget you because history forgets people who are unable to finish anything. Dear Paul, So you're probably used to being at the front of the class and this is a wake-up call that you're not even in the middle. Inform me, are you ready? Sincerely, your anxiety."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:54:00.97" data-timestamp="3240.97">Remember, Paul set it up so that he'd get these messages, on average, 12 times a day. 12 times a day, his phone would ping and there'd be a new attack waiting. While he was eating breakfast-- ping.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:54:11.86" data-timestamp="3251.86">"The simple reason you're not happy is that you're unworthy of saving."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:54:15.21" data-timestamp="3255.21">When he was at work, ping.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:54:17.10" data-timestamp="3257.1">"I respect that you just live your life and don't care if people think you are childish and disgusting."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:54:22.66" data-timestamp="3262.66">While he was watching his kids, ping.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:54:24.75" data-timestamp="3264.75">"Your mom and dad would never say anything, but they so want to know why you choose to be unlovable and not smart."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:54:31.71" data-timestamp="3271.71">When he was getting ready for bed, ping.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:54:34.18" data-timestamp="3274.18">"People on Facebook look at your picture and think, in possession of a weird nose."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:54:38.74" data-timestamp="3278.74">And you made this to make yourself feel less anxious and better.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:54:42.31" data-timestamp="3282.31">Well, that's the thing. The thing I'm trying to do here is externalize the anxiety and actually simulate it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:54:51.75" data-timestamp="3291.75">So what do you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:54:52.71" data-timestamp="3292.71">Well, anxiety-- it turns out, like, building this little emulator-- this anxiety simulator-- made me go, oh, this part of me is incredibly stupid. It says the same things over and over again. And it really is-- like, that is what my anxiety looks like. It's not smart. At some level, it's like a little robot that just screams. What this let me do is look at the robot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:55:16.41" data-timestamp="3316.41">Seeing the voice in his head-- seeing its opinion of him actually written out-- it seemed crazy that he'd ever believed that what it was saying about him was true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:55:24.58" data-timestamp="3324.58">It was immediately effective. And seeing it actually externalized as like 20 messages in a Gmail inbox-- it was so much like what my brain was producing. Seeing it was really funny. It turns your entire emotional freakout into this relentless form of comedy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:55:46.39" data-timestamp="3346.39">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:55:47.17" data-timestamp="3347.17">Yeah. It just-- it turns out that you're not as important as you think you are, nowhere near as terrible as you think you are, and actually fairly ridiculous. Like, it's just so ridiculous to scream at yourself all day long. And yet, there it was. There was evidence of it. And so it was like, oh, my god, I've been wasting a lot of time with this little son of a bitch.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:56:07.92" data-timestamp="3367.92">I feel like something about having it in email lets you fight back against it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:56:11.71" data-timestamp="3371.71">You can actually reply, right? Like, I would reply and be like, go fuck yourself, over and over again. So the ability to actually yell back at something, which I think is something that we usually associate with being terrible on the internet-- in this case, it's wonderful. Because you can yell at the robot and tell him it shut the fuck up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:56:32.82" data-timestamp="3392.82">The notion that you can cure your anxiety without therapy, without drugs, just by trolling yourself. Who'd have thought?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul</h4><p begin="00:56:42.10" data-timestamp="3402.1">I think it doesn't necessarily get solved, you just get more aware of it. It's still there. It's still moving. It's still part of me. I'm sure it'll be there till I die. But it doesn't have as much control.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Pj Vogt</h4><p begin="00:56:56.50" data-timestamp="3416.5">Paul found that when he took the nasty voices inside his head and gave them a home outside of it-- a home on the internet, where tens of millions of other nasty voices live, they couldn't hurt him any more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:12.04" data-timestamp="3432.04">PJ Vogt is one of the hosts of "Reply All." They find such great stories. If you have not heard them yet, you might start with an episode called, "Shine On, You Crazy Goldman," which goes to a very surprising place. "Reply All."</p></div> </div>
