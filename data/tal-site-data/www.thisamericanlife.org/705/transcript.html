<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.01" data-timestamp="1.01"> There's a scene in the film <i>I</i> <i>Am</i> <i>Legend</i> where, OK, civilization is over. The only person left alive in New York is Will Smith, and he is not able to find traces of anyone else alive anywhere on Earth. And every morning, he wakes up and makes himself breakfast, and puts on videos of <i>The</i> <i>Today</i> <i>Show</i> from back before the Earth was destroyed just to make the morning seem normal.</p><p begin="00:00:24.16" data-timestamp="24.16">One of the sports fans on our staff, Matt, was saying the other day that that is exactly what it's like today, watching the constant replays of old sports on television. He's watched the 2018 Stanley Cup, the NBA Finals Game 7 from 2013, an old Yankees game from 1978, the Masters last year that Tiger Woods won, all that glory from back when life was normal and sports was part of it. Part of the thrill of the Michael Jordan documentary <i>The</i> <i>Last</i> <i>Dance</i> was it wasn't just sports, but a primetime Sunday night sports event that you could look forward to and you could watch, knowing other fans were watching and talk about, and share memes just like the world used to be.</p><p begin="00:01:00.07" data-timestamp="60.07">These two guys who write about college football, Jason Kirk and Spencer Hall, wrote this thing that I love about the lack of sports in our world today. These are guys who normally spend over 50 hours a week on a slow week watching games and thinking about sports, who these days, like hungry men raiding an empty kitchen pantry for any scrap of food, have resorted to watching old college games that they've seen before and live Korean baseball in the middle of the night, and the German soccer league, Bundesliga.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:01:26.44" data-timestamp="86.44"> Saturday morning, the choice was between Bundesliga and cornhole, the American tailgate game where people throw sandbags at a wooden plank.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.59" data-timestamp="98.59"> That's Jason. Here's Spencer, explaining what he's come to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:01:42.31" data-timestamp="102.31"> I, yesterday, put on for the edification of my kids and their larger education, Ricky Steamboat versus Macho Man Randy Savage at WrestleMania 3. And it's largely considered the greatest wrestling match of all time. And I realized that since I'm homeschooling my kids, they had to see the important classics of my culture.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:02.43" data-timestamp="122.43"> The canon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:02:03.36" data-timestamp="123.36"> The canon, yeah. No, I mean, it really-- we're joking, but we're not. Like canonically, there's a lot of controversy about what is in the canon, wrestling-wise. No one disputes this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:14.47" data-timestamp="134.47"> Spencer's watching way fewer games under lockdown, and sometimes he says he thought this actually might be better for him, in some way, to devote fewer hours to sports, maybe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:02:24.28" data-timestamp="144.28"> Maybe. But it also makes me realize that the things I fill them with aren't much better. There's a lot of empty--</p><p begin="00:02:29.70" data-timestamp="149.7">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:02:31.05" data-timestamp="151.05">There's a lot of empty space out there, man. There's a lot of empty space in life. And when somebody says, well, now you can fill it with something really meaningful, will you? Or is that even an option?</p><p begin="00:02:44.92" data-timestamp="164.92">I think there's only so much meaning you can pack into the hours of a week. I think there's only so much productivity within one person. I think that's something, by the way, this has forced me to confront.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:57.76" data-timestamp="177.76"> Anyway, the essay these guys wrote about sports during these sportsless months is called "What Were Sports?" And the tone of it is like people who live in tents surrounded by rubble after a war, remembering what it was like to live in houses, looking back on their old lives, which only now they appreciate for what they were. The essay starts this way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:03:17.38" data-timestamp="197.38"> I remember there were expensive commercials. I definitely remember expensive commercials being a part of live sports. I only noticed this when sports on replay happened. The ads for replay games are cheap and very sad-- home generators, car warranties, bootleg tactical gear for things that shouldn't be tactical, like car visors and hearing aids.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:03:37.78" data-timestamp="217.78"> Do you remember how, back when there were sports, each person had a list of teams they strongly preferred to win? Like if the Portland Trail Blazers and Memphis Grizzlies squared off, you and I would be a little bit happier about life if the Grizzlies were the team that won. What was that all about?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:56.37" data-timestamp="236.37"> Other things they miss-- Phillies fans doing things that were not normal for anybody but Phillies fans; spreadsheets of sports statistics for each game, whose results then went into a spreadsheet for the whole season, which then went into a historical archives spreadsheet. "Watching a four-hour game and walking away with one GIF-worthy moment," they write, "felt like a version of sifting for gold, but a version in which the dirt itself was valuable."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:04:20.35" data-timestamp="260.35"> One cool thing I remember about sports is watching people run fast in one direction. It was fun to watch someone do this when unimpeded, such as when Usain Bolt walked into a mall in church shoes or whatever and ran as fast as the fastest NFL player ever had. But it was 10 times as fun when someone was able to run really far while other people were trying to stop that person from running far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:41.80" data-timestamp="281.8"> Also fun, watching big people try to stop fast people from running. They write, "Sports were little chemistry labs designed to run for hours, months, and centuries, along the way producing countless things nobody could have predicted from the onset-- a cool, otherworldly space place where people could completely depressurize for several hours and sometimes succumb to space madness along the way when things went haywire."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Spencer Hall</h4><p begin="00:05:05.28" data-timestamp="305.28"> Do you remember that part? That part was like Apollo 13. Like when your team's starting safety went out with an injury and they had to figure out how to play with 10 defenders and one guy who should have been going to law school instead of covering the other team's best receiver. That part was a problem, but a fun one to solve.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:05:21.16" data-timestamp="321.16"> These problems very much belong to someone else, despite us getting to invest feelings in whether they solved these problems or not. Caring about whether a mediocre general manager could finally figure out how to do sports budgets, this was kind of like politics, but in a fake world in which we didn't have to acknowledge politics can kill us. That was nice.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:46.45" data-timestamp="346.45"> There's a whole passage in the essay where Spencer reminisces about the last live game he went to, LSU and Clemson in New Orleans, and got oysters before the game, and met a friend at a restaurant the next day to eat and talk football for hours. He writes, "Do you hear all the beats of an impossible world playing there? I do. I feel every little ping of a world that I've only missed for 45 days at this point, like cactus needles just pressing into the skin of a hovering hand." Jason sums it all up neatly with this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Kirk</h4><p begin="00:06:14.79" data-timestamp="374.79"> For me, the thing that mattered most about sports is how they, by design, did not matter. We built industrial complexes around them, but at heart they were about discovering which side had earned the right to shout the cooler obscenities on any given day. And then the following day, we would rediscover.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:37.41" data-timestamp="397.41"> Well, today on our program, for everybody who is yearning for sports right now in our sportsless world, we try to help with radio methadone for your sports addiction. Is that metaphor too negative? We have sports stories from back before the lockdown, back when professional sports were still a vital daily living force. We relive the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.</p><p begin="00:06:58.74" data-timestamp="418.74">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Friday Night Floodlights</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:12.97" data-timestamp="432.97"> Act One, Friday Night Floodlights. OK, so let's begin with this story of people yearning for sports to begin again in a moment a few years back, when nothing was normal at all. Businesses were shut down. School was canceled. Kids were stuck home. This story happened right after Hurricane Katrina, in two towns in Mississippi that sit right on the Gulf of Mexico, Waveland and Bay St. Louis.</p><p begin="00:07:34.67" data-timestamp="454.67">Waveland was pretty much wiped out in the hurricane. Most homes and businesses there were destroyed or severely damaged. Bay St. Louis only did a little better.</p><p begin="00:07:43.13" data-timestamp="463.13">A month after the hurricane, when we broadcast our story about them, most people still didn't have electricity. You couldn't drink water from the faucet. One of the first things they decided to bring back, even before that other stuff-- football, high school football. One of our producers back then, Lisa Pollak, went down there in 2005 during those early weeks after Katrina and put together this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:08:03.94" data-timestamp="483.94"> The Bay High Tigers played their first game of the season on the Friday before Katrina. They beat Hancock High, 30-14. After the storm, the joke was that they'd gone undefeated. Everyone figured the season was over. Players were homeless. The high school was closed.</p><p begin="00:08:18.91" data-timestamp="498.91">But just days after the hurricane, the Bay High coach, Brenan Compretta, started hearing from his players. They wanted to play football. They called his cell and sent text messages. They stopped him on the street. They wanted to play football. They wanted something that reminded them of what life was before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brenan Compretta</h4><p begin="00:08:34.00" data-timestamp="514"> The thing that a lot of them were saying is it only takes 11 to play, and that no matter how many they had, they wanted to do this. That was the only thing that they had to look forward to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:08:45.18" data-timestamp="525.18"> You wouldn't stage a school play without a school, but football's different-- here, anyway. In Bay St. Louis, game day starts at 6:30 AM with a team breakfast at a church. Newspaper stories about the game are posted on the wall at school. In the afternoon, drummers from the band march through the hallways just before the pep rally. Strangers in town stop players to talk about that week's game.</p><p begin="00:09:06.22" data-timestamp="546.22">So even though school won't start again until November, the coach called a meeting to try to restart the team. There were some challenges. Only 19 players showed up of the 70 who are on the team. They couldn't use their practice field since National Guardsmen were camping there. Their field house was destroyed and most of their equipment.

And I had flown to Mississippi, where Tyler Brush, the team's quarterback, is showing me around. There's not a lot to see, just huge piles of wreckage, and near the beach, mile after mile of empty spaces where houses and buildings used to be.</p><p begin="00:10:23.35" data-timestamp="623.35">After the hurricane, Tyler's family left for a while, moved to Florida, to a town where they used to live. They got a nice house, and Tyler began high school there. He was practicing with their football squad, and he was going to be a starter there too. But then Coach Compretta called.

So now his family's living 15 miles away in Diamond Head, and two of the team's other players whose families didn't return are living with them too. This is a strange place to be a kid right now.</p><p begin="00:11:28.75" data-timestamp="688.75">With no school, they spend their days doing cleanup work, hauling out sheet rock, and moving trees and debris.

<h3>Act Two: Dunk and Go Nuts</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:47.81" data-timestamp="1607.81"> Act Two, Dunk and Go Nuts. So back in 1996, when Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls were at the height of their power on the way to winning the fourth of the six championships that they won back in the '90s, we did an episode of our show on the Bulls and just about loving basketball. It included the story of a barber named Tommy, who was the one person rooting against the Bulls in a barber shop on the South Side full of Bulls fanatics, as they all watched the playoff game on television, the Bulls against Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tommy</h4><p begin="00:27:17.95" data-timestamp="1637.95"> I like Shaq.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:27:18.98" data-timestamp="1638.98"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tommy</h4><p begin="00:27:19.81" data-timestamp="1639.81"> And they're having a rough time at the moment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:27:22.23" data-timestamp="1642.23"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tommy</h4><p begin="00:27:23.84" data-timestamp="1643.84"> But can't give up the shift yet.

Later, when the game ended and the Bulls won by 15, Tommy insisted, no biggie. The Bulls would lose the coming series against Seattle. And then-- OK, this is the scene I narrated back then in that show.</p><p begin="00:28:01.67" data-timestamp="1681.67">Then we all looked up. And through the plate glass window in front of the barber shop, we saw a car pull up.

[CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:06.25" data-timestamp="1746.25"> That episode of the show wasn't just about being a basketball fan. It was also about playing basketball and what it can mean to you-- and not incidentally, all the trophies that you collect along the way if you're serious about the game. Further you get, the bigger the trophy. Of course, some trophies do not age very well. Get old enough and, at some point, they can just start to look like dusty, aging clutter. One of our producers, Nancy Updike, talked to a friend of hers who played a lot of basketball all about this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:29:33.35" data-timestamp="1773.35"> When I met up with my friend Mary to talk about basketball, she was having some trouble with her trophies. She just moved to a new apartment. And her new place was small, so small that a bunch of high school trophies would just dominate any room they were in.</p><p begin="00:29:49.85" data-timestamp="1789.85">She had the trophies in a box in the living room. And we sat on the floor, pulling out fake silver statuettes of girls in culottes reaching ever upward, hopeful and fit, like in Soviet propaganda posters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:30:02.99" data-timestamp="1802.99"> See, can't you see feeling really tough walking home with something this big, especially if you hold it like this?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:30:08.03" data-timestamp="1808.03"> Sure.

Picture this, a thick slice of wood, sanded and shellacked, and mounted with a miniature rim and backboard, and then leaping across the front a stick figure made of roofing nails going in for a slam dunk. Mary identified this as her 1978 girls varsity team trophy from Cardinal Dougherty High School. And the girls, she said, had not been pleased with the trophy at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:30:45.47" data-timestamp="1845.47"> It's ugly, isn't it?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:30:46.19" data-timestamp="1846.19"> Yeah, it is truly-- it's so damned--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:30:49.34" data-timestamp="1849.34"> We were all really unhappy.

And we also thought that that was the only reason we'd never be in the NBA. Luckily for us, we all thought, well, we're really some of the best players on the face of the Earth. When you're a 16-year-old girl who's playing at a tough Catholic league school, you think, yeah, we're good enough. I'm just as good as Maurice Cheeks, and the Doctor would like to play with me, Dr. J. And we could attribute our lack of success in the NBA to the fact that we were girls, soon to be women, who had never dunked. And that's all that was keeping us from it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:32:07.84" data-timestamp="1927.84"> Mary handed me the wood slice trophy. And when I reached to touch the stick figure, I realized that one of its feet was on a pivot. So I could actually make it go in for the dunk. Once I discovered this, it was impossible not to do it over, and over, and over. The trophy was completely hypnotizing, a disturbing artifact from an artistic period best forgotten.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:32:33.59" data-timestamp="1953.59"> The art of the late '70s, especially like in Catholic religion textbooks and churches and stuff, was so ugly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:32:42.86" data-timestamp="1962.86"> Who knew there was even a genre, the late '70s Catholic textbook art world, that whole scene?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:32:50.36" data-timestamp="1970.36"> I'm afraid I've been so influenced by it.

And the unpurposeness of it is just like, you know--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:33:00.41" data-timestamp="1980.41"> It makes you want to grit your teeth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:33:01.54" data-timestamp="1981.54"> Oh, help me. Yeah, right, right. You can always hear a Cat Stevens song playing in the background.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:33:16.03" data-timestamp="1996.03"> As a kid, Mary played basketball mostly with her older brother, Daniel. The two of them roamed around the city together, looking for pickup games whenever they could, all summer, every weekend-- even at night, because the court down the street had lights. It was a way to get out of the house, to escape the chaos of 11 kids in a working class Irish family in a too-small house on the edge of Northeast Philadelphia. Basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense. And home was a place where you could get hit for no reason or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal. Mary remembered being hungry a lot growing up, a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:33:58.81" data-timestamp="2038.81"> The message was you couldn't be hungry, because your parents are saints. And they especially directed it to our family and to all the other families that had a lot of kids in them, that our parents were saints because they worked so hard to provide for us. So I thought that I was just extraordinarily greedy that I would want to eat when I was hungry.</p><p begin="00:34:25.33" data-timestamp="2065.33">I think that playing basketball was a way to say, like, if I could use my body in this way that got me status and attention and a certain amount of prestige, then my body was OK in a way, even though it was-- I mean, I was way too skinny when I was a kid. And it was cause for concern for the school nurse a couple times. And playing basketball was a way to say you're not going to have neural damage from being malnourished. You're just going to have these other minor malnourished problems.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:35:17.15" data-timestamp="2117.15"> Another good thing about basketball was that it was cheap. Mary bought the family a rim and a basketball for their backyard when she was only seven or eight, using her first communion money, $65 in $5 increments from everyone in her huge family. The only equipment she really needed and could never afford were good shoes. She always had those supermarket checkout line shoes with the hard plastic soles that were completely embarrassing, of course, but also had no gripability. So she would be running down the court and go sliding, and be called for traveling. So one year, she got up the courage to ask a girl down the block for her old shoes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:35:57.10" data-timestamp="2157.1"> Her name was Karen. And she had really nice Beta Bullets, high tops, white. And I wanted her sneakers because I knew she was getting new ones. And in our neighborhood, there is the practice of throwing your old sneakers up over the telephone wires when you're done with them. And most of them were hardly worn out at all. I mean, a lot of them you could see that there was tread missing, but it's not like you had ripped through the top of them.</p><p begin="00:36:27.64" data-timestamp="2187.64">And I'd asked her for them. And she said, yeah, that she would give them to me when she got her new ones. I thought that it was a little bit weird that I would ask somebody for their used shoes, but we had other clothes that were used from other people.</p><p begin="00:36:41.20" data-timestamp="2201.2">And she was tough, and she kind of had this like, you know-- she seemed like she'd be the kind of person that could keep something like that to her and would know what it meant. And she did. She never told anybody, except, of course, the most important person that she shouldn't have told, her mother. And her mother got really upset and told her that she couldn't give them to me. And there they were, hanging up on the telephone wire, my sneakers.</p><p begin="00:37:15.30" data-timestamp="2235.3">And I'm sure that her mom did that because she was afraid that if I came home with a pair of used sneakers that it would be insulting to my mother. I'm sure that they all had this understanding of themselves. Like, you don't insult someone else's-- you don't insult one of your peers by giving their kids your crappy shoes, even though they're better than the crappy shoes that you bought for them. [CHUCKLES]</p><p begin="00:37:37.66" data-timestamp="2257.66"></p><p begin="00:37:44.06" data-timestamp="2264.06">But there were always really beautiful sneakers hanging up on the wires. And there was no way to get them, no way at all. They just floated up there. And you know what? I think that's when I decided that platonic idealism was true.</p><p begin="00:37:58.49" data-timestamp="2278.49">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:38:00.74" data-timestamp="2280.74">There really was a perfect thing that I would never experience, at least while I played in that Catholic league.

They could be the best ball handlers, the best guards, and it didn't matter worth a damn because they couldn't dunk, all of that captured forever in the last trophy most of them would ever receive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Conway</h4><p begin="00:38:58.99" data-timestamp="2338.99"> I think it was really kind of thoughtless in the way that thoughtless things can sometimes have a really nasty edge to them. And we had a woman on our team who was like 6' 3", and she couldn't dunk the ball. You know what I mean? It was like, there was no one that we knew who could dunk the ball, not a single woman that we knew. And we knew some tall women. We knew women who were in college.

Growing up in Peru, Daniel's dad, Renato, played soccer around the neighborhood like all the kids did, but he was never anything special.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:41:02.54" data-timestamp="2462.54"> So it was certain, like, he was never thought of as being an athlete.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:06.26" data-timestamp="2466.26"> But he was thought of, from a young age, as being beyond unusually bright.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:41:11.20" data-timestamp="2471.2"> When I've gone back, I was introduced as, oh, this is Renato's son. And then just heard, like, a-- just, oh, your dad was so smart. Your dad was so smart. When he was a kid, he won this-- he was, like, 14. He won this national quiz show for kids on TV.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:29.77" data-timestamp="2489.77"> Oh, wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:41:30.40" data-timestamp="2490.4"> Flew from the city where he lived in, flew to Lima. He was the only kid from the provinces who was a finalist, only kid from a public school-- front page of the newspaper.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:39.35" data-timestamp="2499.35"> He was incredibly verbal kid, loved poetry and words, great talker. But again, soccer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:41:46.43" data-timestamp="2506.43"> There's two things that happen when you aren't one of the better players. They put you in goal, to be a goalkeeper. Maybe they might make you ref, but that's really, like, low, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:00.49" data-timestamp="2520.49"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:01.09" data-timestamp="2521.09"> But my dad turned that around and wasn't goalie or ref. And I'm sure he played. I'm not saying that he didn't play. But he started calling the neighborhood games.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:11.08" data-timestamp="2531.08"> Wait, wait. So he was calling the games. Did he have gear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:14.23" data-timestamp="2534.23"> He had a microphone and a little speaker.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:17.23" data-timestamp="2537.23"> He could make his voice louder--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:18.47" data-timestamp="2538.47"> Yeah. He could make it, when he's--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:19.02" data-timestamp="2539.02"> --when he's outside.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:19.74" data-timestamp="2539.74"> Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:21.37" data-timestamp="2541.37"> And so basically he's just taking equipment down, and he's announcing kids' actual games--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:26.20" data-timestamp="2546.2"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:26.50" data-timestamp="2546.5"> --as they're playing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:27.40" data-timestamp="2547.4"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:27.77" data-timestamp="2547.77"> Like, kids he knows?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:29.05" data-timestamp="2549.05"> Yeah, kids in his neighborhood.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:30.82" data-timestamp="2550.82"> I would just imagine, like, if I were a kid playing in that game, to have somebody calling the game and I could hear them calling the game as I was doing it, it would make me so much more competitive. You know what I mean? It makes it so much more epic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:42:42.49" data-timestamp="2562.49"> Yeah, absolutely. My picture of it is like, how glamorous. Are you kidding me? Like, suddenly their game is elevated, and it's not just a neighborhood game now. It's like, look, this is just like we're on the radio, which is just like-- that's the same they do for the World Cup.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:01.87" data-timestamp="2581.87"> Daniel's dad would also make up games-- like whole professional games, like all the players, both sides, all the action-- starting, Daniel says, when he was 10 or 11. He would do it just kind of for himself as, like, a thing to do, though the whole family knew he could do this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:43:16.39" data-timestamp="2596.39"> And if-- for example, on a Sunday afternoon after everyone's had lunch, my father would start to be the entertainment for the adults. Hey, Renato. Can you make up a game for us? Make it a good one. And he would just describe a game.</p><p begin="00:43:31.19" data-timestamp="2611.19">And it's a completely made up game, but when a goal would be scored inevitably, the adults would cheer, and like, oh, that was great. That was a great game. And he got really good at this.</p><p begin="00:43:46.16" data-timestamp="2626.16">One of my great uncles had a little theater in a town called Mollendo on the beach, a beach town in southern Peru. And they were doing sort of, like, a night of arts and poetry or whatever-- a talent show essentially, yeah. And my Great-Uncle Juan Castor signed up my dad and was like, you're going to do it just like you do for us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:04.91" data-timestamp="2644.91"> Around the house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:44:05.63" data-timestamp="2645.63"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:06.01" data-timestamp="2646.01"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:44:06.47" data-timestamp="2646.47"> On Sunday afternoons. And I think at that point, he was, like, 12 or 13. He goes out on stage, 300 people in the theater. And he's nervous, but what he does is essentially make up a game. So Melgar is the club from Arequipa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:24.53" data-timestamp="2664.53"> They're the local favorite from the province. And in this game that he made up on stage, they played the big, fancy team from the capital, Lima.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:44:30.18" data-timestamp="2670.18"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:31.39" data-timestamp="2671.39"> They're like the Yankees.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:44:32.33" data-timestamp="2672.33"> They're like the Yankees, yeah. We don't like them. In his telling of it, everyone plays the game with their life. Everyone does it exactly right as if controlled by a marionette-- which, of course, they were.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:46.32" data-timestamp="2686.32"> Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:44:47.78" data-timestamp="2687.78"> I find it very easy to believe that people could have been really moved by the sport. It wasn't like a fake game. It was the game.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:58.52" data-timestamp="2698.52"> And so in his game, the hometown team gets it up to the edge and scores?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:45:04.73" data-timestamp="2704.73"> Yes. Melgar scores. People exploded, like you were cheering something that had actually happened. And the detail that he tells me that I'm always struck by is that when the lights came off and he went off stage, his uncle was crying, just weeping with joy and with, I guess, pride.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:29.62" data-timestamp="2729.62"> There's a video of you online with your dad on stage, and you tell this story. And then your dad comes up on stage, and then he calls a game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:45:36.38" data-timestamp="2736.38"> Yeah. He hadn't done this in like 50 years. But we threw a jersey on him, and he took the mic.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:45.17" data-timestamp="2745.17"> And you threw in some stadium sound underneath for realism.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Renato Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:45:47.46" data-timestamp="2747.46"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:55.24" data-timestamp="2755.24"> What's he saying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:45:55.87" data-timestamp="2755.87"> So he's-- a minute 40, I believe he said.

<h3>Act Four: The Girl With the Golden Gloves</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:17.74" data-timestamp="2897.74"> Act Four, The Girl With the Golden Gloves. So now we travel back in time to a sweaty gym in 1998. That's when this was first broadcast. It's about somebody with a complicated relationship with the sport she loves from Meema Spadola.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:48:32.91" data-timestamp="2912.91"> Maritza was an accountant, a financial analyst at a huge insurance company. She was living day-to-day like anybody else. Then she heard about this boxing class that was being offered at the company gym. Some guy named Milton was teaching.</p><p begin="00:48:46.68" data-timestamp="2926.68">Maritza liked sports. She'd even taken an aerobic boxing class before. So she decided to go down and check it out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:48:53.22" data-timestamp="2933.22"> Here I am in a suit, coming in. It was the first time. I didn't have a chance to change. So I'm walking in all suited up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:49:00.15" data-timestamp="2940.15"> So Maritza comes up, and she's so short. She goes, I want to get rid of my stomach. I want to get rid of my gut.</p><p begin="00:49:07.59" data-timestamp="2947.59">She was so short. I look at her. And I go, honey, I teach boxing. This ain't boxing aerobics, aero boxing. If you want to come and dance around, jump around, I said, I'm not the guy for you. So this ain't what you want.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:49:20.32" data-timestamp="2960.32"> He wasn't even thinking about me. There's another girl who thinks this is aero-- I mean-- so I threw a punch. He goes, oh, you got a pretty good punch there. He goes, let me see what you got. Bam, bam.</p><p begin="00:49:33.21" data-timestamp="2973.21">You got a pretty good punch there, he goes. But who taught you how to box? Two steps. Then he's, like, trying to fix me.</p><p begin="00:49:38.46" data-timestamp="2978.46">I'm going to teach you how to weave. I'm going to shine you up like an old shoe and polish you up. He made me laugh. I thought it was amusing. I found it amusing.</p><p begin="00:49:49.83" data-timestamp="2989.83">It reminded me of watching the old movies. And this guy's telling me I'm like an old shoe. He's going to polish me. This guy's got an act.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:49:57.27" data-timestamp="2997.27"> So I started working with her every day, come down with the pads, giving her combinations. And she started falling into place. So I was like, whoa.</p><p begin="00:50:06.81" data-timestamp="3006.81">I said, you know something? I said, if I could bring you to my gym in Brooklyn, I said, you could win the New York City Golden Gloves. She goes, I can? I go, honey, what I got you doing right now, no girl fights the way you do right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:50:20.73" data-timestamp="3020.73"> So that's how it all started.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:50:24.25" data-timestamp="3024.25"> Every day after work in Manhattan, Maritza would take the subway all the way out to Brooklyn to train for three or four hours at Milton's gym and then go all the way back home to Queens. She spent her weekends at the gym. No one in her old life understood what she was doing. She'd grown up in the projects, put herself through college, gotten an MBA, held a good paying job, and here she was, back so close to the streets.</p><p begin="00:50:46.36" data-timestamp="3046.36">When she got a broken nose and black eyes in the ring, she lied to her coworkers about it, didn't tell them she was boxing. Her parents didn't approve of women fighting. They were conservative, born in Puerto Rico. Her friends were suspicious of her weight loss. They accused her of being anorexic, infected with HIV, or addicted to drugs. But at the gym, everyone believed in her. Maritza was the only girl at Milton's, his first girl. So she'd spar with the men there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:51:12.98" data-timestamp="3072.98"> She took Joey one day, and she was throwing nonstop combinations and punches repetitiously. There was an old man sitting down in a chair, and he goes, god damn, that boy can throw some punches. She had the head gear on. So when she finished, he came over and he goes, that's going to be one good damn fighter. That boy is going to be great.</p><p begin="00:51:32.69" data-timestamp="3092.69">I go, I hate to tell you this. That's no guy. He goes, what do you mean that's no guy? Looked like a guy. I go, that's a girl. He goes, get out of here.</p><p begin="00:51:40.06" data-timestamp="3100.06">So I said, Maritza, come here. So she came over to me, and I took off her head gear. I go, does she look like a girl now? He goes, oh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:51:56.27" data-timestamp="3116.27"> Looking at Maritza, you probably wouldn't think boxer. She's small, just over 5 feet tall, and only 106 pounds. Her features are fine and delicate. But when she talks about her love for boxing, you can see her in the ring. She's radiant. It's like speaking to someone who's had a religious conversion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:52:13.55" data-timestamp="3133.55"> Boxing has shed a light on me. It's like my vision. It's like I just obtained a vision. It's like-- this is what I was put here for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:52:28.66" data-timestamp="3148.66"> Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's next bout is the women's 106 pound class. The referee is Pete Santiago. In the gold corner, Maritza Arroyo from the Supreme Team Boxing Club. Arroyo is a financial analyst and a part-time personal trainer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:52:44.58" data-timestamp="3164.58"> With Milton's training, Maritza was unbeatable. Within a year, she had taken all the amateur titles in New York. She won the Metros, the Empire States, and in '96 she won the biggest of all, the Golden Gloves in Madison Square Garden, a fight televised around the world, held in a ring where some of the greatest boxers in history have fought.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:53:03.10" data-timestamp="3183.1"> Two straight left hands by Arroyo. And another straight left. Four straight left hands by Arroyo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:53:12.23" data-timestamp="3192.23"> Maritza and I get together to watch the video of her '96 Golden Gloves win. The garden's packed. The crowd's going wild. Maritza's incredibly fast and beautiful in the ring. Watching her, you understand what it means to be a smart fighter. She's calculated.</p><p begin="00:53:27.48" data-timestamp="3207.48">The woman she's fighting is taller than she is, with longer arms. So Maritza ducks down low and jabs up to the body, choosing where she lands her punches-- to the ribs, then to the chest. And when her opponent can barely catch her breath, Maritza's up, giving her a fierce combination to the face and head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:53:43.80" data-timestamp="3223.8"> There goes the uppercuts. There goes another one to the body.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:53:47.13" data-timestamp="3227.13"> Ow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:53:48.21" data-timestamp="3228.21"> Another one to the body, another one, another one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:53:51.33" data-timestamp="3231.33"> In the last 10 seconds, Manson gets in a good punch, straight to Maritza's face. Maritza stumbles back and then seems to go crazy. She throws nonstop combinations, and the crowd is screaming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:54:02.89" data-timestamp="3242.89"> There, there goes the hook. See that? Whoa. That's it. 10 seconds. Bam. There you go. I threw it all.</p><p begin="00:54:08.57" data-timestamp="3248.57">Go, go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. Throw it. I missed a lot, but I threw.</p><p begin="00:54:16.36" data-timestamp="3256.36">[BELL RINGING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:54:18.15" data-timestamp="3258.15"> Can we just watch the last 10 seconds? That was so cool. Oh my god. You are so good, Maritza. I want to see you fight so badly.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:54:29.10" data-timestamp="3269.1"> After the fight ends, we're laughing. We keep rewinding to watch Maritza's amazing finale.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:54:35.00" data-timestamp="3275"> I'm like, really? You got it good, right? Well, OK. All right, all right, all right, all right. OK, OK. Yeah, that was a grin. That was a good grin. That was a good grin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:54:48.62" data-timestamp="3288.62"> We're both completely high and hysterical. Maritza's face is transformed. This is pure joy. And in a way it's terrible, because we both know she's quitting boxing.</p><p begin="00:54:59.66" data-timestamp="3299.66">Maritza wants to go pro, but there doesn't seem to be any way she could make a living at boxing. She's only 106 pounds. They don't even have a name for her weight class. If she went pro, no one knows of any women who are good enough to match her.</p><p begin="00:55:12.80" data-timestamp="3312.8">As it is, there are only two amateur women at her level. In all her title matches, she's always been put up against these same two opponents over and over. And she's beat them every time. In 10 years, there may be enough women that Maritza would be able to make a career of it, but she's already in her 30s. She says she has to be realistic about the future.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:55:32.99" data-timestamp="3332.99"> I get mixed feelings. When I go into the gym, I want to do it. But when I come away from the gym and I start looking at reality, it's like, I'm sad. It's like a sadness.</p><p begin="00:55:48.75" data-timestamp="3348.75">Nobody sees it on the outside. No one sees it. But on the inside, it's like it died. It's like, god, it could have been you. You should be in there, boxing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:55:58.34" data-timestamp="3358.34"> It's like she's in love with someone she knows she has to leave. So she circles around boxing, quits, comes back for one-night stands. Last year, Milton signed her up for the Metros tournament without telling her. On the night of the fight, he called her from ringside and told her they were holding up the match for her. Maritza got in her car and drove from Queens to Brooklyn while Milton lied to the judges about Maritza being stuck in traffic. She arrived, beat her opponent in three rounds flat, but was so disgusted with herself for fighting when she was trying to retire that she left without even collecting her trophy.</p><p begin="00:56:31.01" data-timestamp="3391.01">But being back in the game felt too good. And after that win, she just couldn't bring herself to walk away. Despite her reservations, she went on to fight in the 1997 New York Gloves and, of course, won.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:56:48.98" data-timestamp="3408.98"> Come right here real quick. There you go. See the difference? Go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:56:52.84" data-timestamp="3412.84"> In February, just after Maritza misses the deadline for the 1998 Golden Gloves, I go to Milton's gym to see her fight. Even though, these days, Maritza isn't there much anymore, Milton has promised me that Maritza will spar with a new girl he's training. We wait and wait, and no Maritza. An hour passes.</p><p begin="00:57:10.51" data-timestamp="3430.51">When she finally shows, she looks worn out and tired. She's not dressed to box, and she says she's got the flu. She's not going to fight. Right away, everyone starts pushing her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:57:19.81" data-timestamp="3439.81"> Well, let's just do a little.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:20.74" data-timestamp="3440.74"> Do you want to?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:57:21.56" data-timestamp="3441.56"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:22.03" data-timestamp="3442.03"> But I got nothing with me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:57:23.34" data-timestamp="3443.34"> What do you need?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:24.37" data-timestamp="3444.37"> Everything. I don't have nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:57:27.73" data-timestamp="3447.73"> She says she didn't bring her shoes. She doesn't have any of her gear. Milton points to some shoes lying in the corner, says they're her size. Suddenly, Maritza doesn't look so tired.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:37.66" data-timestamp="3457.66"> But I got to tell you, I have no mouthpiece.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:57:40.24" data-timestamp="3460.24"> Then Maritza drops the pretense. We head down in the elevator to her car. Turns out, she's been carrying her gloves, her mouthpiece, her wraps, all of her equipment in her car for the past year, just in case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:51.97" data-timestamp="3471.97"> I knew this was going to happen. That's why I don't want to come around here. That's why I don't want to come.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:57:55.27" data-timestamp="3475.27"> You've got the biggest smile on your face. You look so happy right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="00:57:58.61" data-timestamp="3478.61"> Because I love boxing, that's why. It's got me where I'm at today, OK, very happy and very balanced, I guess. We're around Second Avenue, Second Avenue, between Second and Third, and 13th Street. So here I am, with no voice, going in this room to go spar. Is that crazy? That's crazy?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:58:22.72" data-timestamp="3502.72"> She grabs her bag, and we race back to the gym. And as Maritza's getting dressed, I notice she wears tiny golden gloves on a chain around her neck. Milton stands ringside, pumped up, ready to see his favorite in action again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Kelso</h4><p begin="00:58:35.50" data-timestamp="3515.5"> This is Howard Kelso live, right here from Supreme Team Boxing.</p><p begin="00:58:40.86" data-timestamp="3520.86">[BEEPING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:58:42.82" data-timestamp="3522.82"> Box.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:58:48.76" data-timestamp="3528.76"> Relax your shoulders, Maritza. Relax your shoulders. Too tight. Ooh, good one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:58:54.74" data-timestamp="3534.74"> Maritza's stiff at first, then she starts to relax. She's ducking down, dancing around the ring. And in the last 10 seconds of the fight, she has a surge of energy. She's punching hard, moving fast, throwing nonstop combinations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Milton</h4><p begin="00:59:11.31" data-timestamp="3551.31"> Come on, girl.</p><p begin="00:59:15.71" data-timestamp="3555.71">[BEEPING]</p><p begin="00:59:16.66" data-timestamp="3556.66">Time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:59:19.03" data-timestamp="3559.03"> And afterwards, she's pumped up with adrenaline, sweating, laughing with Milton and the guys in the gym. She says she'll be back to spar and train every week. And even though she's missed the deadline for this year's Golden Gloves, she swears she'll take the gloves next year. Stay tuned for 1999, she says. Stay tuned.</p><p begin="00:59:45.00" data-timestamp="3585">But Maritza doesn't show at Milton's the next week or the week after. She breaks two appointments with me. She doesn't return my calls. And when I finally reach her, she's angry-- angry she fought again, scared she's getting sucked back in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Meema Spadola</h4><p begin="00:59:59.02" data-timestamp="3599.02"> And how about the fact that you're still carrying around your gear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maritza Arroyo</h4><p begin="01:00:05.32" data-timestamp="3605.32"> Well, I guess I can't let go of boxing yet. Maybe it's my security blanket. It's like always knowing that it's always there, that I can always hit that bag. I get in front of the mirror at my house every day, just jab and come around, and do the moves.</p><p begin="01:00:29.27" data-timestamp="3629.27">It's my connection to boxing. I carry this with me. I sleep with it. I have gloves in my car. I love it. It's me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:47.60" data-timestamp="3647.6"> That story from Meema Spadola. Maritza has stopped boxing herself. She's aged out of it. These days, she teaches people to box.</p></div> </div>
