<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.61" data-timestamp="0.61"> OK. Of everything in pop culture, what can make a teenage boy cry? That's a very specialized list, right? And we got to talking about this at our office because Lina Misitzis, one of the producers here, remembers how there was this one video game, a PlayStation game, that got her brother and his friends when they were kids. She says he was definitely not a crier.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:00:25.45" data-timestamp="25.45"> And honestly in my memory of it, my brother Yannos cries halfway through the game because this character dies. He actually says that that's not true. But one of his other friends also remembers him crying. And lots of people had this reaction to the character's death, like famously. No matter how you play the game, she always dies, and people reacted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:48.79" data-timestamp="48.79"> What was the game?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:00:50.47" data-timestamp="50.47"> It's called <i>Final</i> <i>Fantasy</i> <i>VII.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:52.50" data-timestamp="52.5"> When was this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:00:53.52" data-timestamp="53.52"> 1997. And the character that they're all crying over is named Aeris, but some people call her Aerith.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:02.51" data-timestamp="62.51"> And what was it about this character that was so intense?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:01:05.26" data-timestamp="65.26"> Well, OK. So I have no idea. To me, it made no sense. She's like this one-dimensional girl. She's a cartoon. At the time, it was a big deal that she was 3D. So she looked, I guess, believable, but she kind of looks like a <i>Mario</i> character. It doesn't make sense to me that all of these boys would cry over it.</p><p begin="00:01:24.16" data-timestamp="84.16">And so since my brother disagrees that he cried about it, I called someone who definitely did. His name is Mike Fahey. He's a writer for Kotaku, this video game review and reporting website. And he wrote about <i>Final</i> <i>Fantasy</i> <i>VII</i> being remade. It comes out, I think, in the next year or two. And he wrote this article, and the title of the article was, "I Can't Go Through This Again."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:47.89" data-timestamp="107.89"> About this scene?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:01:48.76" data-timestamp="108.76"> About this scene. About this scene. It's about how he doesn't feel like he can deal with her dying two times in his life. One time was enough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:01:55.15" data-timestamp="115.15"> It was a big part of my youth. I mean, it was, what, 22 years ago I played this game. And I still remember that particular moment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:02:05.29" data-timestamp="125.29"> He's in his 40s now, but then he was like-- I don't know-- 24. And he's on his couch playing the game.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:02:11.80" data-timestamp="131.8"> It felt like there was no real lead into it. I might have even had my attention wandering while the cut scene was playing. And then all of a sudden, there's a giant sword in her. Sephiroth comes down, impales her, and you're like, no. This has to change. This has to stop. My stomach fell. I remember my stomach just falling and feeling like it was just dropping in my chest. And that music kicks in just as she's dying. And whenever I hear that music, I just tear right up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:02:44.14" data-timestamp="164.14"> And Ira, this is what the scene looks like.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:46.31" data-timestamp="166.31"> All right, hold on. Let's put this up. OK, you're now watching a video that we're seeing online.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:02:51.76" data-timestamp="171.76"> OK, so you're the protagonist. You're Cloud. His name is Cloud Strife.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:56.35" data-timestamp="176.35"> So that's the character with the orange hair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:02:58.35" data-timestamp="178.35"> Uh, yeah. I mean, it's yellow, but you can call it orange. It's his job to protect her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:03.63" data-timestamp="183.63"> And so they're standing on some sort of platform. There's mist all over the place.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:03:06.98" data-timestamp="186.98"> Yeah, and you can see this girl up here. That's Aeris. Can you see what she's doing?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:12.38" data-timestamp="192.38"> Oh, she's kneeling-- praying?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:03:14.91" data-timestamp="194.91"> She's praying, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:15.62" data-timestamp="195.62"> She's praying. She has long hair braided in a bow, I guess. Pink dress. She looks up. Cloud looks back at her, very dramatic. Oh, a menacing figure in a cape drops down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:03:31.35" data-timestamp="211.35"> So I had Mike watch this with me when I talked to him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:33.72" data-timestamp="213.72"> Wait, he wrote a whole article saying, I can't go through this again, and you made him watch it again?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:03:38.28" data-timestamp="218.28"> Uh, yeah, he was fine. It was just a video clip.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:03:41.23" data-timestamp="221.23"> And here we go. Sephiroth plunges from the heavens. Oh my god.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:49.77" data-timestamp="229.77"> I have to say, it's very sudden.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:03:52.07" data-timestamp="232.07"> And she just slumps over like that, and her eyes are still open. Her mouth parts just a little bit. This is right about where the music starts. And is when the tears start to fall. Ugh, I mean, there's that moment of shock when that sword goes through her. And then, "This can't be real."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:04:12.91" data-timestamp="252.91"> He's reading off the screen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:04:14.35" data-timestamp="254.35"> Cloud says, "This can't be real." And that's really what everyone was feeling right there. That line right there, "Aeris will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry, or get angry." Oh my god. [SNIFFLES] OK. Damn it. "His fingers are tingling, his mouth is dry. His eyes are burning." I'm right there with him. Yeah, I'm tearing up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:51.62" data-timestamp="291.62"> OK, so why of all the characters in all the video games in the world, why do they tear up for this girl?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:04:59.15" data-timestamp="299.15"> Well, in part, it's because it's one of the first times it's happened. I mean, it was just like a surprise. It was really new. And to clarify, Mike knows that Aeris is just this one-dimensional character. The official game description of her is literally, quote, "young, beautiful, and somewhat mysterious."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:14.91" data-timestamp="314.91"> Wait. Could we pause on the word, "somewhat"? That seems so weirdly insulting. Like, well, you're just somewhat mysterious.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:05:20.93" data-timestamp="320.93"> [LAUGHS] OK. Right. And in the game, she really does just two things. She stands next to people and calms them down. Like she'll put her hand on someone's chest in this meaningful way. She's this reassuring presence, this healer. And then the other thing she does is she asks for help.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:40.08" data-timestamp="340.08"> So that's the two basic female functions, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:05:42.70" data-timestamp="342.7"> It's like fix and help. Fix and help.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:44.21" data-timestamp="344.21"> Right. OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:05:45.35" data-timestamp="345.35"> And Mike knows all of this. But he says that's enough. It's enough about her to make you, the protagonist, care.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:05:52.76" data-timestamp="352.76"> She sort of is one-dimensional. She's like the ray of hope. She grows flowers in this disgusting slum. She's almost like a billboard that things can be better. Her sweetness and lightness is what they're really trying to squeeze out of her. So that's what they focus on. And she's understanding. And maybe that's why one of the other reasons you feel for her. Because you feel kind of like she would understand you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:06:21.33" data-timestamp="381.33"> Also, of course, she's pretty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:06:24.36" data-timestamp="384.36"> Yeah, she's adorable. She really is. It's those big blue eyes. They bore into you, really. They're in my head, and they have been for 20 years.

That is a good question. I mean, I think she might have had to work harder as a little brother. Gosh, that's an awful thing to say. Yeah, I think he would have had to have a stronger personality. There would have been some more scenes of bonding with that character.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:07:34.87" data-timestamp="454.87"> I mean, she has no personality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:36.52" data-timestamp="456.52"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:07:37.09" data-timestamp="457.09"> There's a bird in the game that's called like a Chocobo, I think, that has more personality than Aeris does.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:41.94" data-timestamp="461.94"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:07:42.99" data-timestamp="462.99"> Yeah, she's young and she's innocent. And I don't know. In the game, it's confusing whether or not she's like you, the protagonist's romantic interest, or like your little sister. And I think that that's intentional. Those are the things that it takes for you to feel protective of her. And then her death is the thing that energizes all of them to fight and win.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Fahey</h4><p begin="00:08:07.84" data-timestamp="487.84"> It motivates the remaining party members.

People jump in, in real life to rescue young women and get so caught up in that heroic mission, that sometimes, like with Aeris, it kind of doesn't matter who the girl really is or if she wants to get rescued. She's sort of just a girl getting rescued. They don't see what the girl actually wants or needs. They don't see her. We have examples, real life examples.

<h3>Act One: My Very Unhappy Birthday</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:54.18" data-timestamp="594.18"> Act One, My New and Happy Birthday. So let's begin with a young woman that the United States government thought needed to be rescued, meaning well with good reason, at first anyway. Nadia Reiman explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:10:10.26" data-timestamp="610.26"> I'm looking at a sheet of paper with a couple photos of a young woman, a front view and a side view. Pretty small. She's got brown hair, brown eyes. But right below the photos is an X-ray of her jaw. The paper says the X-ray was ordered from O'Hare Airport in Chicago. And this X-ray is what sealed her fate.</p><p begin="00:10:29.80" data-timestamp="629.8">Two years ago, the woman in the picture lands in Chicago. She's coming from Laos disoriented and jet lagged. Her name is Yong Xiong. She's meeting her fianc&#233;, who's waiting for her with his mother and sister at the airport in Minneapolis. All she has to do is get through customs and make her connecting flight. So she steps up to the customs desk, all 4 feet 7 inches of her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:10:50.78" data-timestamp="650.78"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:10:52.67" data-timestamp="652.67"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:10:54.03" data-timestamp="654.03"> They asked me how old I was.

The Customs and Border Protection officer asked to see her passport. Yong doesn't speak English, and the officer doesn't speak her language, Hmong. There's no interpreter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:11:24.43" data-timestamp="684.43"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:11:25.89" data-timestamp="685.89"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:29.58" data-timestamp="689.58"> I gave them my passport, and then they looked at it and asked me to write down my birthday.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:11:35.60" data-timestamp="695.6"> What did you write down?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:36.38" data-timestamp="696.38"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:11:37.38" data-timestamp="697.38"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:11:38.73" data-timestamp="698.73"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:41.54" data-timestamp="701.54"> 6/4/1997.</p><p begin="00:11:43.15" data-timestamp="703.15"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:11:44.43" data-timestamp="704.43"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:46.13" data-timestamp="706.13"> June 4, 1997. So then they asked me about my birthday again and again. After they got my birthday, they looked at me and kind of just thought whatever they're thinking, that maybe I was too little, or my size was something that they were looking at.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:12:07.40" data-timestamp="727.4"> At this point, the officer pulls Yong aside and calls another officer, and another, and another. At least five Customs and Border Protection officers all inspect Yong and conclude that she, quote, appeared to be under the age of 18 based on her physical characteristics and childlike mannerisms. That's what it says in her immigration documents. I saw a bunch of them.</p><p begin="00:12:29.35" data-timestamp="749.35">Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, is trained to watch out for child trafficking. And they thought Yong looked too childlike to be 19. For what it's worth, Yong does look very young. When I met her, I thought so, too. She didn't look like a young woman. She looked 13.</p><p begin="00:12:46.42" data-timestamp="766.42">So the officers went through her papers. They learned that she's here to get married. She has a fiancee visa, so to get it, she's already had to do an interview at the American embassy back in Laos. She's gone through a whole process to confirm that she wasn't lying, that her engagement wasn't a sham. And the government decided that yes, everything checked out. Visa approved.</p><p begin="00:13:07.81" data-timestamp="787.81">But now, here she is, watching the officers going through her stuff, her bags, her suitcase. And they find pictures of her with her fianc&#233;. I've seen them. Some are totally innocuous. They're from their engagement ceremony. Yong and her fianc&#233; are both dressed up, tons of flowers.</p><p begin="00:13:23.08" data-timestamp="803.08">But in a couple pictures taken in some park, Yong's fianc&#233; is kissing her on the mouth, and Yong is looking away. Her face is contorted. You could say she looks put off, disgusted even.</p><p begin="00:13:35.98" data-timestamp="815.98">Yong's family told me that Yong almost always looks grumpy in pictures. A cousin said that Yong never smiles, not even in the ones with just us girl cousins. But the officers note that in the photos with her fianc&#233;, Yong seemed, quote, "physically scared and uncomfortable." They wonder whether Yong has been brought here against her will. Fianc&#233; visas and work visas are a common way traffickers use to get people into the country legally.</p><p begin="00:14:00.86" data-timestamp="840.86">So they get an officer who speaks Hmong and start to ask Yong a bunch of questions. What's your full name? Is this your passport? How many siblings do you have? Where did you meet your fianc&#233;? Oh, and what was your age again? All of which Yong seemingly answers without hesitation. Yong Xiong. Yep, that's her passport. Seven sisters. Met her fianc&#233; in Laos at a New Year's party. He's a US citizen, naturalized. He's also Hmong. Her date of birth? June 4, 1997. She's 19. He's 22.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:14:29.80" data-timestamp="869.8"> So did they tell you at some point that they were worried that you were being trafficked?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:14:34.57" data-timestamp="874.57"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:14:36.36" data-timestamp="876.36"> Yeah, they did tell me that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:14:37.82" data-timestamp="877.82"> What did you say when they told you that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:14:39.54" data-timestamp="879.54"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:14:41.62" data-timestamp="881.62"> I just thought no, that's nuts.

Because it was my choice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:14:57.87" data-timestamp="897.87"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:15:00.16" data-timestamp="900.16"> The officers go through a checklist of 11 questions to determine whether Yong is being trafficked, stuff like, is she missing any documents? Does she appear scared? The answer to 10 of them is no. But then there's one about whether or not she's been coached on what to say. And that one the officers write down, quote, "Appear to be." That, plus the fact that she looked so young, seemed to make the officers believe that, yeah, she's probably trafficked.</p><p begin="00:15:24.82" data-timestamp="924.82">This checklist is just normal procedure. It's what officers have to do if they think something's going on. But then they did do something unusual. They wrote a new birthday into her file, January 1, 2000, making her a minor, 17 years old. There were a lot of unusual things that happened in Yong's case, and this made-up birthday is the first one.</p><p begin="00:15:46.93" data-timestamp="946.93">The officers tell Yong she has to stay at the airport overnight. In the morning, they tell her through a Hmong speaker that they need to figure out if she's over 18. If she is, fine. If not, it'll be a problem. They tell Yong to find out how old you really are, we're going to take you to a dentist. Yong had never been to a dentist before. As she took a seat in the waiting room, she just thought, I guess this is normal. This is what they do when you enter the United States.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:16:15.62" data-timestamp="975.62"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:16:17.85" data-timestamp="977.85"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:16:21.42" data-timestamp="981.42"> I waited until they called my name, took me to the dental chair and told me to just sit down and lay back. And then they told me open my mouth. And then they had a stick that looked like it had a mirror on it. And they went to the side here and this side, all around on the inside.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:16:39.00" data-timestamp="999"> So did you know what was happening?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:16:40.36" data-timestamp="1000.36"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:16:42.00" data-timestamp="1002"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:16:43.37" data-timestamp="1003.37"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:16:45.04" data-timestamp="1005.04"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:16:46.49" data-timestamp="1006.49"> I didn't.

[SPEAKING HMONG] They said, open your mouth, like this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:16:57.88" data-timestamp="1017.88"> Yong shows me how they moved their hand, like a sock puppet who just opened its mouth wide.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:17:02.83" data-timestamp="1022.83"> Like with your hand?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:17:03.70" data-timestamp="1023.7"> [SPEAKING HMONG] Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:17:07.38" data-timestamp="1027.38"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:17:09.60" data-timestamp="1029.6"> I remember they told me to bite down, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:17:13.77" data-timestamp="1033.77"> The dentist took the X-ray. No one would talk to me on the record about this, but because it's the government, there is a massive paper trail. And not just in Yong's case. I'm going to go deep on these tooth X-rays for a second, so bear with me. They're used all kinds of immigration cases, not just trafficking. And a lot rides on the results. If you're under 18, you have more protections. You get put into a shelter instead of a detention center. It's harder to get deported.</p><p begin="00:17:40.63" data-timestamp="1060.63">But tooth X-rays are just not a very precise way to determine someone's age. The way it works is they measure how developed the roots of your molars are, and then based on that, the dentist can determine your age, but only within a range, usually around five years. So these X-rays can't tell you the difference between a 17-year-old and a 19-year-old. The same teeth might belong to a 15-year-old or a 20-year-old.</p><p begin="00:18:04.32" data-timestamp="1084.32">Back in 2007, Congress told ICE they were, quote, "troubled by the use of these exams," by their lack of accuracy and by the fact that migrants don't necessarily give consent. Congress said please stop. And yet, the government keeps using them anyway.</p><p begin="00:18:19.11" data-timestamp="1099.11">And also, I found out the way the government is using these X-rays is alarming. They're using the teeth to make migrants the age they want them to be. A political science professor at Northwestern named Jackie Stevens is the one who told me about this. Back in 2018, Jackie was helping research a legal case. She runs something called the Deportation Research Clinic, which reports on government misconduct.</p><p begin="00:18:42.18" data-timestamp="1122.18">And she got a giant document dump from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR, people putting migrant kids into shelters. She got about 5,000 pages. The documents revealed that ORR had done hundreds of these forensic exams on migrants over the past couple of years.</p><p begin="00:18:58.71" data-timestamp="1138.71">Jackie found two things that ORR was doing wrong. One is they were using exams they weren't supposed to. The rule is that, legally speaking, if you're trying to prove someone is an adult, you can only take into account exams that show that with at least 75% probability. If they're below that threshold, you can't use them as evidence. But Jackie found that ORR was consistently determining people's ages with reports they weren't supposed to use.</p><p begin="00:19:24.42" data-timestamp="1164.42">The second big thing Jackie found, time and again, ORR used the age range in the report to make the migrant 18 or over. So if they got a range that said this person could be 15 to 23, they'd pick at least 18. It's hard to know exactly why ORR would do this. I asked ORR why. Like, what's in it for them? They never responded.</p><p begin="00:19:48.13" data-timestamp="1188.13">But the way the teeth are usually being used is mostly to turn boys into men. In Yong's case, the opposite seemed to happen. Her X-ray was used to make her officially a child in the bureaucracy of the US immigration system. CBP had flagged her as a possible trafficking victim. She looked young. Southeast Asia is a trafficking hotbed.</p><p begin="00:20:08.48" data-timestamp="1208.48">And once that idea took hold of US government agencies, it was very hard for Yong to shake. Because the way I see it, if the government sees Yong as a girl entering the country in danger, as a girl coerced, a girl too small to be a bride, then they had to protect her. And even if part of the officer suspected she might be telling the truth, that she might really be 19, that she might really be here because she wants to get married, they'd have to be sure-- like 100% sure. So they had her teeth X-rayed.</p><p begin="00:20:40.54" data-timestamp="1240.54">In the documents, the dentist writes, quote, "The range of possible ages is 14.76 to 19.56 years." In other words, it's totally plausible that Yong could be 19 as she's been saying. But she could also be 17, like the officers decided. They seemed to use the X-rays as proof that they're right. Yong's new birth date of January 1, 2000, it sticks. And it starts to reshape her life.</p><p begin="00:21:15.25" data-timestamp="1275.25">The agents drive Yong straight from the dentist to a juvenile shelter. It's in Chicago. It looks like a school. It's run by ORR. She's told she can't talk to her fianc&#233;, the supposed trafficker. As soon as she is allowed to, Yong calls her mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:21:31.38" data-timestamp="1291.38"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:21:32.57" data-timestamp="1292.57"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:21:35.64" data-timestamp="1295.64"> I just told her they brought me to this place to stay with all these kids. I just thought, now I'm in their hands, and this is where they put me. I don't know what's going to happen next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:21:47.56" data-timestamp="1307.56"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:21:49.53" data-timestamp="1309.53"> Yong is assigned to a room with four other girls. There are 13-year-olds at the shelter, but also babies. She spends her days doing all these kids things, like she has to vote for which kids movie to watch during movie night. She goes on trips to the zoo. She does math worksheets. She gets clothes to wear while she's there, but they don't fit her because she's so small. At first, Yong soldiers on. She starts to learn English. She thinks she'll just sit tight, and it'll all get sorted out. She's pragmatic, keeps a tight lid on her emotions.</p><p begin="00:22:19.31" data-timestamp="1339.31">When she's assigned to a clinician, Yong tells her right away, like the day they meet, that she's 19. She's here to be with her fianc&#233;. Two days later, she brings it up again. Nothing changes. She brings it up dozens of times. It's in all her shelter documents. In one note, the clinician writes, quote, "Minor repeated to clinician she is not under 18. Clinician told minor she believes her. But there needs to be documentation to prove her statement."</p><p begin="00:22:46.43" data-timestamp="1366.43">Day in and day out, Yong keeps asking, what's happening? Why am I here? Her frustration starts to bubble.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:22:52.54" data-timestamp="1372.54"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:22:53.61" data-timestamp="1373.61"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:22:56.42" data-timestamp="1376.42"> I told them I'm almost 20.

We can't help you with that because this birthday that is on the paperwork is what came with you when you were admitted into this building.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:23:14.54" data-timestamp="1394.54"> This is not true, by the way. ORR makes changes to ages based on dental X-rays like the ones I mentioned at any point. They can happen even after someone's been admitted. Yong has an aunt named Xia in Minnesota, one she doesn't know very well. They met once back in Laos.</p><p begin="00:23:30.65" data-timestamp="1410.65">And she asks, since they won't release her to be with her fianc&#233;, can she be released to go live with her aunt? The shelter contacts the aunt to test her DNA to make sure she and Yong are related. They are. But the shelter decides not to release Yong to Aunt Xia because Xia tells them that Yong is an adult. So the shelter concludes she might let Yong run off with the fianc&#233;/supposed trafficker.</p><p begin="00:23:53.84" data-timestamp="1433.84">At one point, her documents say, quote, "Minor began to state she doesn't know what to do anymore. And she cannot think of any solutions and feels stuck in the program."

It turns out ORR resubmitted the X-rays of Yong's teeth to a second dentist who concluded Yong could be anywhere between 15 and 20 years old. After which, ORR did change her birth date. But they used the lowest end of the range possible. The documents say DHS, the agency that oversees everything related to immigration, told them to. Her new, new birth date is now September 1, 2002.</p><p begin="00:25:36.92" data-timestamp="1536.92">The shelter orders a wrist X-ray to assess the age of Yong's skeleton. The results come back that Yong is likely 18. The doctor concludes that Yong is still 15, just has, quote, "advanced bone age." She's gone from being 19 to 17 to 15, just like Benjamin Button.</p><p begin="00:26:03.47" data-timestamp="1563.47">You know that kind of nightmare where you're trying to run, but you can't move? Yong says living inside the shelter was just like that. Day after day, she watches the kids around her leave to go stay with relatives. But she's trapped. The clinician notes that Yong's become more irritated. And then about 10 months into her shelter stay, something pushes Yong over the edge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yong Xiong</h4><p begin="00:26:23.25" data-timestamp="1583.25"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:26:24.50" data-timestamp="1584.5"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:26:25.94" data-timestamp="1585.94"> I was hanging out with my friends, and then my friends had asked me what my name was.

I didn't like that name at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nadia Reiman</h4><p begin="00:27:44.46" data-timestamp="1664.46"> So the shelter is like, fine. We won't call you Jane Doe anymore. For the first time in almost a year, Yong is heard.</p><p begin="00:27:58.75" data-timestamp="1678.75">Meanwhile, in the outside world, many parts of the US government with many different acronyms are trying to figure out what the hell is going on with Yong. ORR, the shelter people, who've been given the new age by DHS, the immigration people, are running around with the OS, the State Department people, to confirm what CBP, the Border Protection people, originally thought of Yong, the migrant person.</p><p begin="00:28:20.71" data-timestamp="1700.71">It turns out, according to Yong's family, someone from the US embassy office in Laos went around Yong's village asking questions, asking to see her family registry, which is this record that families in Laos keep that basically lists who was born when. Also, they asked the Laos embassy to confirm Yong's fifth grade and ninth grade school certificates. Both have her age, and the embassy says they're both legit</p><p begin="00:28:44.44" data-timestamp="1724.44">I talked to an ICE spokesperson, more immigration people, and they say that going deep like that doesn't sound uncommon. Like if they think they have a case of human trafficking on their hands, they spend time and resources checking it out, especially if they think the victim is a minor and especially if the region is known as a place where trafficking is common, which Southeast Asia is.</p><p begin="00:29:04.00" data-timestamp="1744">In the embassy's report about Yong, it says that, quote, "It does occur that the Hmong population will represent themselves as older for the purpose of applying for a visa." And quote, "Usually under questioning, the girls will admit their real age if they lied." And quote, "Common for them to look very young, malnutritioned, underdeveloped."</p><p begin="00:29:24.09" data-timestamp="1764.09">In Laos, the average height of a woman is about 4 foot 9 inches. This makes them one of the shortest populations in the world. At 4 foot 7, Yong is shorter than average, but not unusual for Laos. It's obvious that Yong is being measured with a Western ruler.</p><p begin="00:29:39.64" data-timestamp="1779.64">The fianc&#233; was never charged with anything. He says no law enforcement came to talk to him. Lawyers that deal with cases like this told me this is unusual if he was actually a trafficking suspect. Normally, an investigator from ICE would show up to interview him, but as far as I can tell, no one did. There is one thing I found out, though-- something about Yong's fianc&#233; that troubled me when I heard it.</p><p begin="00:30:01.06" data-timestamp="1801.06">One person working with Yong told me that he was kind of a big jerk, that he yelled and threatened the shelter when he was talking to them about Yong, and that when the shelter said this will be a process to get her out, he said fine. If you don't let her out, then I don't want her anyway. The person I spoke with said that's why the shelter didn't want to release her to him. They were afraid he didn't really care about her.</p><p begin="00:30:22.51" data-timestamp="1822.51">I ran this by Yong's fianc&#233;, and he says none of this is true. He would have loved to talk to Yong, but he says the shelter wouldn't let him. He says that at one point, he took a week off and weighted by the phone because the shelter said they would call him. They never did.</p><p begin="00:30:43.83" data-timestamp="1843.83">Finally, on June 8, 2018, about 14 months after entering the shelter and four days after her 21st birthday, Yong is released. They release her as a minor under the custody of her aunt, Aunt Xia. This is her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Xia Yang</h4><p begin="00:30:58.33" data-timestamp="1858.33"> [SPEAKING HMONG]</p><p begin="00:30:59.61" data-timestamp="1859.61"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:31:04.87" data-timestamp="1864.87"> They said, we are releasing her to you.

Most of them don't know how much older she is. She doesn't bring it up, and they don't seem aware of it. And then finally, after more than two years of waiting, Yong got her identity back. She had an immigration hearing just two weeks ago at the end of June, a little after her 22nd birthday.</p><p begin="00:33:08.37" data-timestamp="1988.37">DHS told Yong's lawyers that they were dropping the age thing. They said they were not contesting her passport or, quote, "any of its contents," which of course include her birth date-- you know, the one she says is real, June 4, 1997.</p><p begin="00:33:24.00" data-timestamp="2004">Yong went home that day and called her fianc&#233; at night. It was the first time they were allowed to talk since she got to the States. They cried. Then they made dinner plans. Yong was happy, but sort of isn't used to the idea that this is real. Same thing for her fianc&#233;. He says he keeps wondering if she really is here for good and if legally, he really is allowed to marry her. So for now, he just waits for Yong to call him and make plans.</p><p begin="00:33:50.55" data-timestamp="2030.55">So I still can't say exactly why any of this happened to Yong. I reached out to all the immigration agencies involved in this case. CBP and ICE both declined to comment on Yong, and ORR as well, because, they say, she's a minor. Her lawyers' take on why this happened is they think the government made a judgment call and screwed up, and just started something in motion they didn't know how to stop.</p><p begin="00:34:14.61" data-timestamp="2054.61">On some level, it seems like maybe everyone was just afraid to miss a trafficking case. And then her passport, her visa, all her documents from Laos just didn't matter anymore. Yong's still here under a fianc&#233; visa, so she has to get married. If she doesn't, she has to go back to Laos. She's back at square one. It's like she just came into the States, holding her passport and her suitcase. Like no time has passed when she landed at O'Hare in 2017-- except it has.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:55.43" data-timestamp="2095.43"> Nadia Reiman is one of the producers of our show.</p><p begin="00:34:58.24" data-timestamp="2098.24">[MUSIC - YOUTH GROUP, "FOREVER YOUNG"]</p><p begin="00:35:01.03" data-timestamp="2101.03"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:35:19.79" data-timestamp="2119.79"> Coming up, a whole country gets obsessed with rescuing a girl-- a missing girl.

In the video, he's standing at a blackboard, explaining that classic stories each have their own formula. And then he's literally mapping them out on the board.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Vonnegut</h4><p begin="00:36:08.85" data-timestamp="2168.85"> So there's no reason why the simple shapes of stories can't be fed into computers.

So picture, OK, like in school, an x and a y-axis, right? With me? And then the vertical axis represents here how good or how badly a person is doing in their life. So bad fortune at the bottom of the line, good fortune at the top.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Vonnegut</h4><p begin="00:36:36.77" data-timestamp="2196.77"> Sickness and poverty down here, wealth and then boisterous good health up there.

B is the beginning of the story. E is the ending. And then Vonnegut demonstrates how this works. He says that some stories start with the person who's kind of happy, so they begin more than halfway up that vertical line that measures good or bad fortune.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Vonnegut</h4><p begin="00:37:08.00" data-timestamp="2228"> So I would start a little above average. Why get a depressing person? We'll start-- The whole thing, we call this story man in hole. But it needn't be about a man, and it needn't be about somebody getting into a hole.

And then he tells the audience he's going to clue them in on the most powerful kind of story of all. This kind of story starts, he says, with the main character not doing well at all.

And on September 19 in 2017, the whole country ran through the drill as usual at 11:00 AM. Roughly two hours later, a real earthquake hit. It was a big one, an estimated magnitude of 7.1. Over 300 people died. Thousands of buildings were damaged. And one of those buildings was a school in southern Mexico City.</p><p begin="00:40:49.36" data-timestamp="2449.36">When the school fell, it wasn't a total collapse. Only one side fully crumbled. There was a big hole in one of the walls. And through it, one of the classrooms was visible-- posters, and kids' drawings, and big colored letters in the midst of destruction. 19 kids were killed at the school, and a bunch more were injured. So pretty quickly, tons of media showed up.

News of this girl trapped alive quickly becomes the biggest story of the earthquake. The first reporter led into the cordoned off area around the school is this woman named Danielle Dithurbide. She works for Televisa, the largest Spanish language broadcaster in the world. She's dressed like she's going into battle, khaki vest and a hardhat that looks like a helmet.</p><p begin="00:43:47.25" data-timestamp="2627.25">And anytime there's new information, Danielle hears about it.

People are donating supplies and posting all over Twitter and Facebook about her. There's a hashtag, #FridaSofia. One person tweets, "She moved her hand, moved Mexico's heart."

Here's Laura the filmmaker again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Laura Tejero Nunez</h4><p begin="00:48:35.69" data-timestamp="2915.69"> So the earthquake is the 19th. We hear about Frida the morning of the 20th. And it's about 30 hours later, like the 21st of September, that the rescue authorities say that Frida never existed. The story of Frida Sofia is a lie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:48:57.22" data-timestamp="2937.22"> No Frida Sofia was enrolled at the Enrique Rebsamen School. There is no Frida. The way everyone finds this out, the head of the Navy, the guy who's been giving, essentially, minute by minute updates on national television about Frida's condition, he goes on TV and gives this awkward press conference.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Head Of Navy</h4><p begin="00:49:20.08" data-timestamp="2960.08"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Laura Tejero Nunez</h4><p begin="00:49:25.09" data-timestamp="2965.09"> He says that Frida Sofia is not a reality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:49:29.71" data-timestamp="2969.71"> That seems like very specific word choice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Laura Tejero Nunez</h4><p begin="00:49:32.72" data-timestamp="2972.72"> Yeah, like he wanted to say like, oh, this wasn't a reality. I'm not going to say that anyone told lies. I'm not going to say that this wasn't true. Because that sounds much worse. I think he was aware of how big the idea of Frida had become, how prescient in the minds of the Mexicans she had become.

Do you remember anyone inviting you into the hole?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle Dithurbide</h4><p begin="00:52:37.83" data-timestamp="3157.83"> No, that's not true. No, that's absolute-- that's a complete lie. That's not true. I swear on my life on it. That's not true.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:52:45.41" data-timestamp="3165.41"> When the Navy Undersecretary Sarmiento said Frida wasn't real, he also denied ever telling reporters that she was, which made Danielle furious. She saw him saying that to another reporter just a few feet away from her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:52:58.08" data-timestamp="3178.08"> I mean, if I'm you, I feel like I would want to run over there, and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle Dithurbide</h4><p begin="00:53:01.97" data-timestamp="3181.97"> And kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Yes, exactly. That was my exact feeling. I wanted to kill him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:53:08.48" data-timestamp="3188.48"> Later on TV, the Navy Undersecretary apologized. He said Danielle was right. He had passed on wrong information. We reached out to the Navy multiple times, by the way, but never got clearance to do an interview.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:53:21.34" data-timestamp="3201.34"> Who do you think started the Frida myth?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle Dithurbide</h4><p begin="00:53:24.12" data-timestamp="3204.12"> I don't know. I've been thinking about it for one year and a half, and I don't have any answer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:53:32.63" data-timestamp="3212.63"> I don't have an answer either. But here's what I do know. Let's go detail by detail. The motion sensor and thermal scanner that detected Frida's body heat and movement, that technology can be imprecise. The movement it detected, that could just be the rubble shifting. The body heat it detected, that could be a piece of metal that's just exposed to the sun, and therefore warmer than the things around it.</p><p begin="00:53:56.80" data-timestamp="3236.8">As for the workers who heard Frida's voice, well, rescue workers pulled the body of a 58-year-old woman from the rubble after they'd talked to Frida. Maybe it had been her voice they had heard. Though her name wasn't Frida Sofia, it was Reyna D&#225;vila.</p><p begin="00:54:12.54" data-timestamp="3252.54">Or maybe the name Frida Sofia came from somewhere else. There was a Sofia there. She was one of the kids rescued earlier in the day. And there was a Frida on sight, too, a rescue dog helping to look for victims. I have no idea if that explains anything.</p><p begin="00:54:34.13" data-timestamp="3274.13">There are some details that no matter how I turn it, just don't seem like mistakes, like the cell phone and the text messages. A volunteer told the press that story. I couldn't find him to follow up. And that rescue worker who told the public that Frida had been rescued, we looked all over for him. Couldn't find him anywhere. Felipe, that rescue worker I talked to, he feels like, of course, I couldn't find the answer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Felipe Duran Emiliano</h4><p begin="00:55:00.83" data-timestamp="3300.83"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:55:02.51" data-timestamp="3302.51"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:55:04.61" data-timestamp="3304.61"> These are people that like to show up on TV, those people that enjoy telling lies, and people that just don't like to accept the truth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Felipe Duran Emiliano</h4><p begin="00:55:14.45" data-timestamp="3314.45"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:55:17.12" data-timestamp="3317.12"> I really can't explain to myself how it is that this was made up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Felipe Duran Emiliano</h4><p begin="00:55:22.83" data-timestamp="3322.83"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:55:25.82" data-timestamp="3325.82"> I imagine that this was the smokescreen, the whole Frida situation, in order to detour or to mask up the information. Merely a distraction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:55:42.09" data-timestamp="3342.09"> He means a distraction from the person who's taken a lot of blame for the school collapse. Remember the Monicas? The principal of the school and her daughter, who worked there as a teacher and who said she talked to Frida. The principal, Monica Garc&#237;a Villegas, she's also the owner of the school. It's a private school, and she lived there with the rest of her family.</p><p begin="00:56:02.81" data-timestamp="3362.81">The building was originally just two stories, but they built two more stories on top and made that their apartment. The principal used all these heavy materials in the construction. She built marble floors and granite countertops. She added a new terrace, but didn't add any columns underneath to support it. She installed a Jacuzzi. When the earthquake hit, all of that overwhelmed the bottom two floors of the building, and it crumbled. It was likely the principal's apartment that killed 19 kids and at least seven adults.</p><p begin="00:56:37.07" data-timestamp="3397.07">The principal fled the scene shortly after the school fell, though not before her daughter and other family members had recovered some of their valuables from the rubble, like purses and shoes, their car, a Mercedes Benz, and a bathtub they got four of the rescue workers to carry for them.</p><p begin="00:56:52.77" data-timestamp="3412.77">Authorities offered a five million peso reward to anyone who could find her. After nearly two years, the principal was finally arrested on charges of manslaughter in early May of this year. I reached out to her for a comment, but never heard back.</p><p begin="00:57:08.27" data-timestamp="3428.27">If the principal and her daughter knew all along that they didn't have a student named Frida Sofia, if the daughter was just pretending to talk to someone trapped under the rubble, if the Navy, for some reason, was passing along unfounded details to the press, or if the deception was more innocent-- volunteers hoping for the best and spreading rumors-- it all fell on willing ears. Hundreds of people had been killed by the earthquake. Lots more were still missing. Of course people wanted a little girl to root for.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:44.69" data-timestamp="3464.69"> Aviva DeKornfeld is one of the producers of our show.</p><p begin="00:57:51.72" data-timestamp="3471.72">[MUSIC - LITTLE JACKIE, "TO THE RESCUE"]</p><p begin="00:57:54.68" data-timestamp="3474.68"></p><p begin="00:58:15.87" data-timestamp="3495.87"></p></div> </div>
