<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:04.36" data-timestamp="4.36"> So Miki, this is your high school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:05.35" data-timestamp="5.35"> This is my high school. And it's really weird to be here with you, even though I suggested this. Even though this was my idea.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:13.68" data-timestamp="13.68"> We're in Payson, Utah, a small town about an hour south of Salt Lake City. It's me and Miki Meek, one of the producers here at <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> She hasn't been back to her high school since she graduated, but says it looks the same. And same groups of kids too-- jocks, stoners, cowboys, regular kids.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:30.75" data-timestamp="30.75"> And which were you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:32.23" data-timestamp="32.23"> I think I was a regular kid. Regular kid/county kid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:35.61" data-timestamp="35.61"> OK, so you guys lived in the country.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:36.68" data-timestamp="36.68"> We lived in the country, yeah, yeah. Let's see, where are we are walking by now? Just walking through the hallway. This is the main hallway. Opening scenes of <i>Footloose</i> are right here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:50.11" data-timestamp="50.11"> Oh, right. Payson High School is where they filmed <i>Footloose.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:00:53.00" data-timestamp="53"> Yeah, the opening scene, so Kevin Bacon's first day of school. He walks past the cafeteria in this hallway, and a cowboy confronts him, right in this spot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:00.81" data-timestamp="60.81"> Right in the spot where we're standing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:01.94" data-timestamp="61.94"> Right in the spot where we're standing, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:04.81" data-timestamp="64.81"> I downloaded the film later. Totally true. But of course, America, everybody knows there's a time to be born and a time die, and a time to dance, and a time to talk about <i>Footloose.</i> And this is not that time.</p><p begin="00:01:16.34" data-timestamp="76.34">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:01:18.52" data-timestamp="78.52"> We are not here in Miki's school to talk about a movie about dancing. We're here to talk about real life dances at this high school, and more specifically, the way that the real life students ask each other to dances.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:29.60" data-timestamp="89.6"> You ask someone to a dance, you've got to go big. Which means you've got to leave something on someone's porch. You gotta decorate their car. You gotta break into their bedroom. You gotta send them on a scavenger hunt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.08" data-timestamp="98.08"> Break into their bedroom and do what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:39.37" data-timestamp="99.37"> Decorate it, trash it, leave a message.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:42.73" data-timestamp="102.73"> The very minimum anybody does is a bit of prop humor. You leave some object and then a pun written on poster board. Like Owen Grimshaw was just asked to the Sadie Hawkins Dance this way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Owen Grimshaw</h4><p begin="00:01:53.35" data-timestamp="113.35"> They had pants in a box. And they said "I'd ship my pants if you went to Sadie's with me."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:00.33" data-timestamp="120.33"> A senior, Ivan Webber, Told me about last year's Sweethearts dance, he took a laminated name tag, wrote a message on it, and then froze it in a block of ice, which he was very proud of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Ivan Webber</h4><p begin="00:02:11.05" data-timestamp="131.05"> I was just like, "Going to Sweethearts would be cool." And it was like, "it's pretty chill." Like, chill. OK?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:19.36" data-timestamp="139.36"> No, I get it.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:02:24.53" data-timestamp="144.53"> Sometimes the props they use are living animals. And some of these kids have access to farms. Ivan's little sister Mariah left a pair of goats at a guy's house with a poster.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mariah Webber</h4><p begin="00:02:34.24" data-timestamp="154.24"> And it said, "I'm not kidding. I would love to goat to Sadie's with you."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:39.55" data-timestamp="159.55"> Slight variation on that, senior Alyssa Sutton left a guy a basket with four baby kittens and this message.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alyssa Sutton</h4><p begin="00:02:46.06" data-timestamp="166.06"> "I'm not kitten when I say I want to go to Sadie's with a cool cat like you."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:50.74" data-timestamp="170.74"> Senior Ashlynn Yul left a chicken for a guy who asked her to a dance, a live chicken and Starbursts. The message?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ashlynn Yul</h4><p begin="00:02:57.85" data-timestamp="177.85"> "I'm not going to chicken out on you. I've been bursting to say yes."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:00.97" data-timestamp="180.97"> The guy actually returned the chicken. The goat got returned too. The kittens stayed. Junior Caitlin Mitchell left a tree for her boyfriend.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Caitlin Mitchell</h4><p begin="00:03:10.19" data-timestamp="190.19"> And I asked him, "It would be tree-mendous if you'd go to Sweethearts with me." And he answered back with "Needle-less to say, I'd be burning up if I'd said no." And he lit the trees on fire in my front yard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:21.35" data-timestamp="201.35"> Wait. He set them on fire?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Caitlin Mitchell</h4><p begin="00:03:23.00" data-timestamp="203"> Yeah. There was snow in my yard, so-- I mean--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:27.11" data-timestamp="207.11"> Saying yes, you're supposed to be as creative as the person who asked you. Tyler Johnson told me about the time that his sister had a neighbor help her out with that. The neighbor was a policeman, and she hid in the back of his police car as he spotted the guy who asked her to dance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Johnson</h4><p begin="00:03:40.34" data-timestamp="220.34"> So I pulled him over. And at the time, the kid had a few-- I don't know, the point system, where you can get your license suspended. He was really close to getting his license suspended, so I thought it'd be extra funny. And so he pulled him over. Officer told him all these things that he did wrong. And he was freaking out. And then the officer gave him a ticket, and the ticket just said "yes," and then my sister's name on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:04.34" data-timestamp="244.34"> Incredibly, the guy still took her to the dance. It can be a ton of work doing these things. The most elaborate one I heard about was I met this one couple, Tyler Batty and Liz Callahan. And Tyler kidnapped Liz, this elaborate kidnapping-- duct tape, blanket over her head. She knew it was fake, by the way. Was not scared.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Liz Callahan</h4><p begin="00:04:23.52" data-timestamp="263.52"> There was three boys, and they were talking. They were trying to sound like they're terrorists kind of. They were trying to talk him in some weird language.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Batty</h4><p begin="00:04:33.05" data-timestamp="273.05"> And we'd just kind of shout gibberish, just a mix of any foreign words we know from Japanese, Russian, Korean, kind of sticking to mostly like a Russian accent. Like this, deeper.</p><p begin="00:04:53.65" data-timestamp="293.65">[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]</p><p begin="00:04:55.37" data-timestamp="295.37"></p><p begin="00:04:56.24" data-timestamp="296.24">Just kind of random stuff like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:59.57" data-timestamp="299.57"> Give me a little more.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Batty</h4><p begin="00:05:02.05" data-timestamp="302.05"> It's not logical. Just shout random words.</p><p begin="00:05:05.07" data-timestamp="305.07">[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]</p><p begin="00:05:06.97" data-timestamp="306.97">Just random syllables and funny stuff, goofy stuff, yeah. But I mean, if you were wrapped up in a blanket and someone's talking like that, you're more than likely to be scared.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Liz Callahan</h4><p begin="00:05:17.52" data-timestamp="317.52"> I was like, I know it's you guys. And they were like, no you don't! What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Batty</h4><p begin="00:05:21.89" data-timestamp="321.89"> There's no way she could have known who it was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Liz Callahan</h4><p begin="00:05:25.39" data-timestamp="325.39"> So I was calling all their names out. I was like, I know you guys are right there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:29.58" data-timestamp="329.58"> They threw her into the back of an SUV and then swerved around the roads, up into the mountains. And then Tyler staged a rescue in a Batman costume, supposedly saving her from the fake kidnappers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tyler Batty</h4><p begin="00:05:41.99" data-timestamp="341.99"> I just start flinging open doors, kind of punching my buddies kind of hard, so it sounds realistic. Of course, it's not super hard punches, but just they're grunting, and uh, oh. They're yelling stuff. "Get him. Where is he?"

And while you hear about schools where kids do these kinds of things for prom-- in fact, right now MTV is casting a TV show called <i>Promposal--</i> here in Utah and a few other places around the country, they make the grand move every dance-- homecoming, Sweethearts dance, Sadie Hawkins, Winter Ball.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:50.09" data-timestamp="830.09"> Act one, Dr. Strangelove. OK, this first story is about a guy who goes so far in his grand gestures that I need to say before we start, this story is not for kids. OK? Here's Miki Meek.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:14:03.53" data-timestamp="843.53"> I have a pile of newspaper articles about the story I'm going to tell you. It's a love story from Florida in the 1940s. The papers went nuts for this story. It's about a man who loved a woman so much that he never got over her death. <i>The</i> <i>Miami</i> <i>Herald</i> at the time ran their love story across the front page.</p><p begin="00:14:22.01" data-timestamp="862.01">The man's name is Carl von Cosel. There's a giant photo of him, where he looks charming and fragile in a white suit. Right next to that is a photo of Elena Hoyos in her wedding dress and a tiara. Her hair is in perfect black ringlets. She's beaming.</p><p begin="00:14:37.22" data-timestamp="877.22">Elena died young. She was just 22. After her death, Von Cosel visited her grave every day and brought flowers. He built her a fancy mausoleum with a dome, surrounded by palm trees and flower pots.</p><p begin="00:14:49.49" data-timestamp="889.49">And then this is the thing that made it a news story. Von Cosel stole her body from her grave, and then kept her in his house for seven years.</p><p begin="00:15:07.67" data-timestamp="907.67">From the time von Cosel first met Elena, he launched into a series of grand gestures, each bigger than the previous, until he went too far.</p><p begin="00:15:16.65" data-timestamp="916.65">They first met at the hospital in Key West. Von Cosel was an x-ray technician, and Elena was 20 years old and sick with tuberculosis. Back in the '30s, TB killed a lot of people. There was no cure.</p><p begin="00:15:28.99" data-timestamp="928.99">I talked to a guy named Ben Harrison. He wrote a book about the two of them. He lives in Key West and got curious about the case when he moved there. He says that von Cosel fell in love with Elena right away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:15:39.48" data-timestamp="939.48"> She apparently was strikingly beautiful. He took a blood sample from her finger. Normally, he would take it from a patient's ear, but hers was far too lovely to mar.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:50.28" data-timestamp="950.28"> Is that what he said?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:15:51.15" data-timestamp="951.15"> Yes these are in his journals, that he didn't want to in any way disfigure her beauty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:57.81" data-timestamp="957.81"> This was the kind of guy von Cosel was. He wrote a memoir, where he said things like he didn't want to disfigure Elena's beauty, and that her voice sounded like a mockingbird's song in spring. He considered himself a scientist/inventor and claimed to have multiple university degrees in subjects like chemistry, philosophy, and physics, although Ben says he never could verify any of that.</p><p begin="00:16:19.53" data-timestamp="979.53">He told me von Cosel's first grand gesture is telling Elena, sure, science hasn't developed a cure for TB, but--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:16:27.06" data-timestamp="987.06"> Not to worry. He has revolutionary new cures, and he will cure her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:16:33.07" data-timestamp="993.07"> And what were they? I mean, how was he going to cure her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:16:35.01" data-timestamp="995.01"> Well, he at first started radiation treatments there at the hospital. Then, as her illness progressed, he came by and started treating her in her home. He made this Frankenstein-ish electrical contraption.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:16:51.12" data-timestamp="1011.12"> What did it look like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:16:52.02" data-timestamp="1012.02"> It looked like a big globe, and it had sparks inside. And he put electrodes on her chest, and they would shock her. He claimed that this put thousands of neutrons in the air, billions of neutrons in the air. And these were going to help cure her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:17:07.24" data-timestamp="1027.24"> This gets weirder and weirder.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:17:09.18" data-timestamp="1029.18"> It was pure nonsense. It was just not going to work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:17:12.30" data-timestamp="1032.3"> Did she want the treatments, though?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:17:14.31" data-timestamp="1034.31"> I mean, there was just nobody else who offered any hope whatsoever. So this was her only chance, because he was the only one offering a silver bullet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:17:23.58" data-timestamp="1043.58"> Von Cosel was full of confidence about his own abilities. For example, he was trying to fix up a broken airplane he'd parked behind the hospital. It didn't have wings. He lived inside it. He was a German immigrant in his 50s, with a trim beard and wire-rim spectacles, walking around town, wearing all white, and carrying a cane.</p><p begin="00:17:48.60" data-timestamp="1068.6">So far, their story has the makings of a great tragic love story. He loved her on sight. She was sick with an incurable disease that he'd do anything to cure. But there's one detail most of the newspapers left out. She never loved him.</p><p begin="00:18:02.76" data-timestamp="1082.76">Elena was actually married to another guy. But after she got sick, he left her. So she moved back in with her family. They didn't have a lot of money.</p><p begin="00:18:11.58" data-timestamp="1091.58">Von Cosel pursued Elena with the same arrogance and optimism he did everything else, giving her gifts, jewelry, a catalog where he told her to pick out whatever she wanted. But Elena's sister, Nana Medina, says it wasn't mutual.</p><p begin="00:18:25.59" data-timestamp="1105.59">She gave a long interview to the <i>Miami</i> <i>Herald,</i> where she said, quote, "She never loved him. She was only nice to him because my mother told her she should be kind to those who were kind to her. She looked upon von Cosel as a grandfather. And when he proposed marriage, she always told him 'You are too old. Why, you are old enough to be my grandfather. What's more, I do not love you.' He became so persistent that we asked him to stay away from the house."</p><p begin="00:18:56.09" data-timestamp="1136.09">Elena died about a year and a half after she met von Cosel. When he heard the news, he rushed across town to be by her side. Here's how he wrote about it in his memoir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Von Cosel</h4><p begin="00:19:05.63" data-timestamp="1145.63"> I went down to my knees before the bed. Elena's jaw had dropped, but her eyes were bright and clear. They had a faraway look. And as I gazed into those beloved eyes, they seemed to become deeper and deeper, like wells, which, with magnetic power, drew me in. I could not tear my eyes away from her. I could look forever. My poor, darling Elena.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:19:32.68" data-timestamp="1172.68"> So many of Von Cosel's choices during this period of time illustrate just how thin the line is between romantic and creepy. Gestures that seem romantic when someone loves you immediately flip to disturbing when they don't. Von Cosel paid for Elena's burial and for a headstone, which did not include her married name on it. But it did have his name inscribed on the lower half. Again, here's Ben.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:19:56.89" data-timestamp="1196.89"> Because for one, her married name is Mesa, and he wasn't about to put her married name on a headstone that he had bought.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:20:09.36" data-timestamp="1209.36"> On his daily visit to Elena's grave, von Cosel starts worrying about rainwater seeping into her casket, and convinces the family to pull it from the ground. He begins building a mausoleum.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:20:19.69" data-timestamp="1219.69"> Von Cosel talks to the funeral director, or the night watchman, or whoever, that he needs to come in and rebed her body.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:20:28.94" data-timestamp="1228.94"> What does that mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:20:30.74" data-timestamp="1230.74"> She's been dead for long enough so that she's decomposing. And he is very upset, because he claimed the mortician didn't follow his instructions as far as embalming goes. And so he puts new cloth on it, and cleans up the casket, and he takes off the dress she was buried in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:20:52.18" data-timestamp="1252.18"> Man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:20:53.39" data-timestamp="1253.39"> Because it's rotted, and replaces it with cloth, and I think he put some new felt underneath her. He loved her that much.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:21:05.88" data-timestamp="1265.88"> That's one way to describe it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:21:07.34" data-timestamp="1267.34"> Yeah. And he was becoming more and more delusional.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:21:13.40" data-timestamp="1273.4"> Elena, of course, didn't ask for any of this. She didn't love him. She's paradoxically at the center of this story and utterly left out. Still, von Cosel kept going. He put Elena in a double casket. That's one casket inside of another. He said he wanted to protect her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:21:30.38" data-timestamp="1290.38"> I really don't think he accepted the fact that she was dead. I think he still felt she was alive, because I think he had valves on this thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:21:38.42" data-timestamp="1298.42"> For what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:21:39.23" data-timestamp="1299.23"> So he could speak with her directly into the casket.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:21:43.28" data-timestamp="1303.28"> He wrote in his memoir that, to him, these weren't one way conversations.

It was always the same old Spanish song about a lover who opens the grave of his dead bride. I could distinctly hear and understand every word.</p><p begin="00:22:18.00" data-timestamp="1338">[SINGING IN SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:22:20.32" data-timestamp="1340.32"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:22:23.00" data-timestamp="1343"> The song is a Cuban bolero called "Black Wedding."

Without her love, he simply could not reason. At night, he would visit the graveyard and dream about the days she was alive.</p><p begin="00:22:51.20" data-timestamp="1371.2">His tears would fall upon her tombstone, the tombstone of the girl to be his bride. On a night when thunder roared and lightning flashed, he broke apart the tombstone of her grave. And with his hands, he dug into the earth, and in his arms, he carried her away. By a flickering funeral candlelight, on his bed that flowers covered, he gently laid the body of his sweetheart, and said his wedding vows to his dead lover.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:23:16.67" data-timestamp="1396.67"> The song was written to be tongue in cheek, ironic and inappropriate, but von Cosel took it literally, as inspiration for everything he's about to do next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:23:26.57" data-timestamp="1406.57"> According to von Cosel, this is her plea for him to please take her home with him, the same way the distraught lover does in the song.</p><p begin="00:23:37.31" data-timestamp="1417.31">[SINGING IN SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:23:39.81" data-timestamp="1419.81"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:23:47.27" data-timestamp="1427.27"> Von Cosel wrote that he waited for a new moon, got a wagon, and stole the casket.

Von Cosel hadn't been deterred by what Elena wanted back when she was alive. Now that he had her dead body in his home, he could play house, dress her up, have sex with her. And he did all of those things.</p><p begin="00:24:27.96" data-timestamp="1467.96">He wrote in his memoir that he made Elena breakfast, eggs and a cup of Lipton tea. He filled the vases next to her bed with flowers and sometimes just talked to her about the weather.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:24:37.31" data-timestamp="1477.31"> She was kind of his living doll, there in their little household. And they celebrated Christmas together, and he put a Christmas tree there, and put 13 candles and said he played his organ to her until the candles burned down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:25:00.78" data-timestamp="1500.78"> This went on for seven years. He also conducted experiments to try to bring Elena back from the dead. In his memoir, he wrote that he gave her radiation treatments, and submerged her in a tank filled with quote, plasma fluid.</p><p begin="00:25:14.31" data-timestamp="1514.31">Eventually, Elena's sister, Nana Medina, started to suspect that something was up. There were rumors. And she asked von Cosel to open Elena's mausoleum for her, but he refused. So one day, Nana showed up at his house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Harrison</h4><p begin="00:25:28.15" data-timestamp="1528.15"> Well, she walks in and sees this effigy, this Elena, in a sort of wedding, gauze wedding thing lying on the bed. I mean, as she describes it, it was the most horrific thing she'd ever seen in her life. But as upset as she was, she said, if you will take the body back and put it in there, we'll just let this go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:25:50.30" data-timestamp="1550.3"> Von Cosel didn't return the body, so she went to the Key West police. They arrived at his house in a motorcade, and von Cosel confessed immediately.</p><p begin="00:25:59.05" data-timestamp="1559.05">And that's when the gifts started arriving at the jailhouse. People brought him fruit, cookies, and hot tea. They serenaded him at night. A group of women from Tampa brought him money. Locals posted his bond. An attorney took on his case pro bono.</p><p begin="00:26:12.76" data-timestamp="1572.76">People were captivated by this story. A newspaper quoted von Cosel saying, "I did not want one so beautiful to go to dust." A radio station in Havana ran a soap opera about Elena and von Cosel's great romance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Roberts</h4><p begin="00:26:26.29" data-timestamp="1586.29"> He was in love with her?

How could people see this as a romantic story?</p><p begin="00:26:41.44" data-timestamp="1601.44">Well, for starters, Ida's mom didn't know at the time that von Cosel was having sex with Elena's corpse. There were rumors, but the truth didn't come out for decades, when a doctor from her autopsy wrote about it in a medical journal. But still, that doesn't change the story so much for Ida.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Roberts</h4><p begin="00:26:56.41" data-timestamp="1616.41"> My mother knew Maria Elena.

The autopsy report came out he was having sexual relations with her, or attempting to?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Roberts</h4><p begin="00:27:21.22" data-timestamp="1641.22"> Well, I guess he was in love with her, and he made love to her. And he didn't care whether she was dead or not. In fact, he never-- he never wanted to think that she was dead. He wanted to think that she was coming back. She was asleep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:27:34.90" data-timestamp="1654.9"> I think, Ida, you are a very hard person to shock.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Roberts</h4><p begin="00:27:37.65" data-timestamp="1657.65"> Yeah, mhm.

You know, I mean--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:28:39.61" data-timestamp="1719.61"> According the record, he was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Roberts</h4><p begin="00:28:40.90" data-timestamp="1720.9"> Wait, but he didn't chop her up and throw her in the ocean or anything, like a lot of people have done, you know? A lot of spouses. But he took good care of her. And he wanted-- he just didn't want to let go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:28:55.84" data-timestamp="1735.84"> I mean, definitely selfish, though. In a lot of ways, I mean, he's doing what he wants to do, and not necessarily what the family would have wanted her to do-- wanted him to do, or even Elena.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Roberts</h4><p begin="00:29:03.74" data-timestamp="1743.74"> Love is like that.

When you find somebody you want, you want them regardless.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:29:19.82" data-timestamp="1759.82"> Love is an excuse for all sorts of behavior. I can understand why so many people wanted to believe this version of the story. It's much easier and nicer to see this as a grand gesture of a lovesick man than the abuse of a delusional pervert.</p><p begin="00:29:34.83" data-timestamp="1774.83">In the end, the charges against von Cosel were dropped. The court looked into whether he was insane and decided no. They called his obsession with Elena a quirk.</p><p begin="00:29:44.49" data-timestamp="1784.49">Even when the public was presented with physical proof, Elena's body, they chose to see the story this way. After police took Elena's body from von Cosel, the funeral home, incredibly, put her out on display, probably without the family's permission.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Carbonell</h4><p begin="00:29:59.58" data-timestamp="1799.58"> It was a big crowd that day, I think, and we just followed the crowd.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:30:03.57" data-timestamp="1803.57"> That's Don Carbonell.

She had glassy eyes, and she just-- she didn't look real. She didn't look real. Looked like maybe somebody made up a body. That's the way she had impressed me. You'd say a big, overgrown doll.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:30:53.73" data-timestamp="1853.73"> The newspaper articles quoted people who said she looked beautiful. "Von Cosel did such a good job preserving her." One woman wrote a letter saying, "they should enclose Elena in a glass case and turn her into a Sleeping Beauty attraction." Which is basically what's happened to Elena and her story today.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Key West Tour Guide</h4><p begin="00:31:10.11" data-timestamp="1870.11"> All right, our story takes place here in 1930, and involves this young girl right here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:31:15.63" data-timestamp="1875.63"> This is from a trolley tour of Key West for tourists these days.

Each week on our program we choose a theme, bringing you a variety of different stories on that theme. Today's show, as we watch Valentine's Day recede into the rearview mirror of our lives, our theme is grand gestures, stories of people who go all out, and what it means when they do. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act 2, Say It Out Cloud.</p><p begin="00:33:06.32" data-timestamp="1986.32">One of our producers, David Kestenbaum, spoke with some people who are in the grand gesture business. I'm talking about sky writers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:33:13.17" data-timestamp="1993.17"> Every sky writer I talked to you had a story of some odd message they'd put in the sky. Someone paid for a cartoon cloud to be drawn in the sky, with little lines for rain. And then there was the message that was just numbers, 3.1415 etc. Get it? Pi in the sky.</p><p begin="00:33:29.54" data-timestamp="2009.54">The comedian Kurt Braunohler recently hired a pilot to put up the skywriting message over Los Angeles that he'd always wanted to see. "How do I land?"</p><p begin="00:33:37.40" data-timestamp="2017.4">Even a simple message can cost a couple of thousand dollars. And it doesn't last very long. Basically, as soon as it's written, it starts to fall apart. So a lot of the time, it's people with a pretty big emotion who want to write something in the sky.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suzanne Asbury-oliver</h4><p begin="00:33:49.82" data-timestamp="2029.82"> It was the woman that contacted me, and she couldn't-- it was a very secret love affair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:33:55.96" data-timestamp="2035.96"> This is Suzanne Asbury-Oliver.

Essentially, as soon as we figured out how to fly, someone was like, "You know what? I'm gonna write giant letters in the sky." The first pilot did it in the 1920s, maybe even earlier. And the vast majority of personal messages seem to be essentially the same thing over and over.</p><p begin="00:35:24.45" data-timestamp="2124.45">"Marry me," or "I love you," or a heart, or "I heart you." Here in New York, the usual spot is over Central Park. And it seems to be mostly guys who want to put messages of love in the sky. The male sky writers I talked to didn't have a lot of theories about why that was. But Suzanne did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Suzanne Asbury-oliver</h4><p begin="00:35:43.71" data-timestamp="2143.71"> Maybe men have a harder time expressing themselves?

<h3>Act Three: It&#8217;s Gesture Imagination</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:10.59" data-timestamp="2530.59"> Act 3, It's Gesture Imagination. More than anybody on our staff, maybe more than anybody I've ever met, actually, one of our producers, Elna Baker, really, truly believed in the power of grand gestures. It was this kind of magical thinking that lasted well into adulthood for her, into her late 20s.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:42:29.16" data-timestamp="2549.16"> I believed that it was the surest way to show someone you love them or to win love.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:36.33" data-timestamp="2556.33"> And a grand gesture could be, like, what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:42:38.78" data-timestamp="2558.78"> A declaration of love, like a speech, but in a very public manner. A giant cardboard sign. Showing someone that you especially knew them through a very special gift.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:54.44" data-timestamp="2574.44"> Elna grew up Mormon. And talking to her about how she loves grand gestures made me think of those kids from Payson High School. Remember them? We started today's program with them. Lots of those kids are Mormon. And the way they ask each other to dances at that school happens all over Utah. And it occurred to me, is there something about being young and Mormon and grand gestures that go together?</p><p begin="00:43:16.44" data-timestamp="2596.44">And this isn't something you could prove one way or another, but just to say it, you have these kids who are forbidden to drink or have sex. Maybe that's one reason that their feelings for each other play out with these elaborate schemes, right? And that made sense to Elna.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:29.65" data-timestamp="2609.65"> Yeah. No, I definitely-- once I started having sex, I stopped doing grand gestures. Because I was like, oh, turns out you can just-- [MUMBLING] You know? You could just have sex with someone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:43.90" data-timestamp="2623.9"> That made it weird dirtier, the way you just said that.</p><p begin="00:43:47.37" data-timestamp="2627.37">[CHUCKLING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:49.36" data-timestamp="2629.36"> OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:49.95" data-timestamp="2629.95"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:51.25" data-timestamp="2631.25"> And I grew up on grand-- like my parents, the way my parents got together was-- I grew up on stories of grand gestures.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:57.21" data-timestamp="2637.21"> Oh, is that true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:43:58.39" data-timestamp="2638.39"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:58.73" data-timestamp="2638.73"> Like what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:44:00.76" data-timestamp="2640.76"> My dad and mom dated for about two and a half weeks. And my dad went to the Mormon temple, and he was just praying to see if he should date this woman. And he said that he heard the voices of his future children, like me and my brothers and sisters, and we were like, hurry, go, do it. Like, we want to be born.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:23.80" data-timestamp="2663.8"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:44:24.25" data-timestamp="2664.25"> Yeah. And he rushed out of the temple, went and found my mom, knocked on her door, brought her outside of her dorm. And in front of the dorm, there was a rock, like a big rock. And he made her stand on top of the rock. And then he knelt down and said, "Will you marry me?" And she said yes.</p><p begin="00:44:43.33" data-timestamp="2683.33">They'd been dating for two and a half weeks. They've known each other for four weeks. And my parents actually are very in love, and very happily married. And so I believed that love was like hearing a voice that basically told you this was right. And then you would do anything for that voice.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:04.58" data-timestamp="2704.58"> And that's the attitude towards love Elna carried into adulthood. When she would talk to our friends about their romantic lives and situations, at some point, Elna would tell them, OK, here's what you have to do. You have to go big. And she'd give advice that, today, she thinks was totally wrong headed. Up until her 20s, she had no experience in love, had never had a real adult relationship, was completely naive about all of it.</p><p begin="00:45:26.78" data-timestamp="2726.78">But she still cheerfully jumped in with her advice. She encouraged her friend Nick to move to New York City to prove his love for a woman who had broken up with him and did not want his love. She convinced your friend Allie to give a guy that she'd just started seeing this giant birthday crown, homemade with fur and feathers and a star with his picture that kind of jumped off the crown. He never went out with Allie again.</p><p begin="00:45:49.85" data-timestamp="2749.85">When Elna's friend Louise regretted breaking up with her boyfriend, Gabe, and decided she wanted Gabe back, Elna suggested a gift. She remembered that a couple months before they had found this vintage 1970s-era McDonald's uniform in his exact size. And he'd had all these stories of working at McDonald's in high school. So Louise bought this thing for him, to give as a present on Halloween, but never gave it to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:46:12.92" data-timestamp="2772.92"> So he got it from the closet, and I was like, what you have to do is go over to his apartment and leave it at his door. He'll get it. He'll know that you get him, and you love him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:23.00" data-timestamp="2783"> Now, when you suggested this to her, what was her attitude about it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:46:26.12" data-timestamp="2786.12"> That's a terrible idea. She was very, very resistant. But then this thing happens when you're with me, apparently, where I just got her all spun up into the idea.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:37.07" data-timestamp="2797.07"> Your air of confidence drew her in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:46:39.32" data-timestamp="2799.32"> Totally. It's like I put her in a box and shook the box, and then-- or when a kid is going to play pinata, and you turn them around and then push them in the direction--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:50.57" data-timestamp="2810.57"> Of the pinata. That's what you did to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:46:52.76" data-timestamp="2812.76"> That's what I did to her, where she eventually just started getting excited about the gesture itself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:00.08" data-timestamp="2820.08"> Which is key. It became about the bold thing that they were doing, versus how Gabe would feel. And it worked out about as well as you would expect. Louise left the box with the gift for Gabe, with no note-- just left it in his building.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:47:15.44" data-timestamp="2835.44"> And so they met up and had this huge blow out fight, where she was like, how come you didn't thank me for the gift? And he was just like, you totally broke my heart. You crushed me. And it actually is offensive that you think that this gift could just instantly make up for all of that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:36.95" data-timestamp="2856.95"> Were you surprised?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:47:38.24" data-timestamp="2858.24"> Shocked. I was waiting like a puppy at the door for her to come in and tell me, thank me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:46.30" data-timestamp="2866.3"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:47:46.94" data-timestamp="2866.94"> And she walked in, and she was crying, and totally devastated, heartbroken.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:57.74" data-timestamp="2877.74"> Elna didn't just organize these kinds of schemes for other people. She did them herself. Like, one time, she was taking tickets as a page for <i>The</i> <i>Letterman</i> <i>Show</i> and met this random guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:48:08.35" data-timestamp="2888.35"> He was in line to see the show, and we talked very briefly. And I thought I heard a voice that said, "This is who you are meant to be with."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:20.82" data-timestamp="2900.82"> She knew, of course, from her parents to trust that voice. So she gave this guy her number and dated him for a month and a half, and it went nowhere. Then, two years later, still hung up on this guy, who'd moved to Zambia, she wrote him an email.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:48:36.07" data-timestamp="2916.07"> Which I have here. Do you want me to read the email I wrote?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:39.07" data-timestamp="2919.07"> Totally.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:48:39.88" data-timestamp="2919.88"> All right. "I don't know if you're still in Zambia, but my girlfriends and I are going to South Africa in the spring to visit some family friends of mine. I'm not sure how far Zambia is from South Africa, but if it's close, I'd love to come up and say hi. It'd be fun to see you. It's been a while. I hope you're well. X, Elna."</p><p begin="00:48:59.84" data-timestamp="2939.84">But OK, I did not have a trip to Africa planned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:03.31" data-timestamp="2943.31"> Do you have some sort of friends in South Africa?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:05.38" data-timestamp="2945.38"> No, made that up entirely.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:07.68" data-timestamp="2947.68"> And then "I don't know if Zambia is near South Africa." Did you actually look on a map?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:12.38" data-timestamp="2952.38"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:12.85" data-timestamp="2952.85"> Yeah, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:14.26" data-timestamp="2954.26"> But that's why I chose South Africa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:17.00" data-timestamp="2957"> She roped two girlfriends into this trip, spent all her money, thousands of dollars on plane tickets. They stayed at this guy's little studio apartment, and on the very first night of a 10 day visit, she snuck over to his sleeping bag, woke him up, and tried to kiss him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:31.68" data-timestamp="2971.68"> And he said, I think this is a bad idea.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:36.28" data-timestamp="2976.28"> And so what were the next nine days like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:39.06" data-timestamp="2979.06"> Really uncomfortable. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:46.19" data-timestamp="2986.19"> And then there was the time that Elna tried to drag her friend Heather into pursuing a guy with one of these capers. Heather was one of the friends that Elna took on that trip to Africa. She was a page at <i>The</i> <i>Letterman</i> <i>Show.</i> And Elna would sometimes ask her--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:49:58.83" data-timestamp="2998.83"> Who do you like? Or tell me about your relationships. And she was always really vague about it. And she would just say that she'd been in love before, but it just hadn't worked out.</p><p begin="00:50:09.48" data-timestamp="3009.48">And so I kept fishing for details. Eventually, after a few months, I got out that they were college sweethearts. They'd been together about five years. And it just hadn't worked out.</p><p begin="00:50:19.94" data-timestamp="3019.94">And so I kept trying to strategize. I was like, OK, well, we gotta-- if you still love him, we're going to make this work out. What can we do to show him how you feel?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:30.21" data-timestamp="3030.21"> What did you suggest that she might do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:50:31.86" data-timestamp="3031.86"> Well, I asked well, when are you planning a trip home? Can you see him? No, I can't see him. Well, why not?</p><p begin="00:50:39.48" data-timestamp="3039.48">And then after, maybe six, seven months of this, one day she said, "Look, I feel really bad for not having told you this, but the reason it didn't work out is that he died in a forest fire." And yeah, and they were planning on getting married. He was her whole life, her whole future. She imagined having kids with him.</p><p begin="00:51:06.74" data-timestamp="3066.74">Although I will say in retrospect, I was like a goldfish. I blinked my eyes, and I was like, well?

That was it.</p><p begin="00:52:01.10" data-timestamp="3121.1">And so she finishes the story, and I was like, this is the worst story I've ever heard.

They would get edits and suggestions.</p><p begin="00:54:30.81" data-timestamp="3270.81">Then one day, Heather calls Elna and tells her she sent the letter. And really, for the first time, Elna realized, oh wait, maybe this is a bad idea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:54:41.83" data-timestamp="3281.83"> I don't know. It hit me in that moment that sending the letter would mean that Heather was going to get hurt. And I felt really nervous.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:54.57" data-timestamp="3294.57"> Yeah. Because every other time you've tried this, it's failed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:54:58.66" data-timestamp="3298.66"> Exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:59.80" data-timestamp="3299.8"> And suddenly you realize, oh, she's going to be hurt, and she was feeling OK, and now I got her hopes up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:06.88" data-timestamp="3306.88"> Yep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:07.57" data-timestamp="3307.57"> And she's going to feel bad, and it's my fault.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:09.49" data-timestamp="3309.49"> Exactly. Yeah, but then at the same time, I also felt proud of her. Because this was the first-- I felt like she put her heart out again. I guess the consolation in that moment was, this probably isn't going to work out, but she showed the universe, or whatever, that she's willing to try again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:33.36" data-timestamp="3333.36"> Well, she showed herself that she's willing to try again after all the sadness that she'd had with her boyfriend. So does she end up getting a boyfriend after that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:42.98" data-timestamp="3342.98"> Well, so two weeks later the guy who got the letter wrote back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:50.32" data-timestamp="3350.32"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:55:50.68" data-timestamp="3350.68"> And it was actually pretty short and friendly. He remembered meeting her, and she left an impression on him too. And they started dating. And they dated for seven years, and now they're married.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:03.13" data-timestamp="3363.13"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:03.98" data-timestamp="3363.98"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:04.83" data-timestamp="3364.83"> Wait, that's the end of the story?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:06.08" data-timestamp="3366.08"> Yeah, they actually got together.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:07.78" data-timestamp="3367.78"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:08.38" data-timestamp="3368.38"> I know. I gave a toast at their wedding, where I told this story of writing the letter. It's kind of the most magical thing that I've ever helped facilitate.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:23.18" data-timestamp="3383.18"> OK, so that worked with her. Do you think these kinds of things are a good idea?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:27.98" data-timestamp="3387.98"> Grand gestures?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:28.98" data-timestamp="3388.98"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:30.01" data-timestamp="3390.01"> No, not anymore. And actually, I think it worked--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:33.81" data-timestamp="3393.81"> Wait, wait, I'm confused now. Why are they a bad idea?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:56:39.21" data-timestamp="3399.21"> It seems false. It's not really how you show someone you love them in the way I thought it was. I feel like it has more to do with you than the other person.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:52.05" data-timestamp="3412.05"> She actually hasn't done this stuff now in almost a decade, doesn't miss it. And when she looks back on it, she thinks she was doing those big gestures because she was so unsure of herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:57:02.29" data-timestamp="3422.29"> I was afraid that they wouldn't like me, if I just was like, hey, I'm interested in you. This is who I am. I thought maybe you like construction paper, and giant signs, and hot glue gun art.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:15.84" data-timestamp="3435.84"> Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:57:16.12" data-timestamp="3436.12"> And if I'd show you all of that and I'm standing behind it, then if I'm not enough, at least you'll like that, and you'll say yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:24.98" data-timestamp="3444.98"> It's scary being real with another person. And there are so many ways to avoid it. This is just a particularly splashy one.</p><p begin="00:58:02.34" data-timestamp="3482.34">Our program was produced today by Miki Meek.
