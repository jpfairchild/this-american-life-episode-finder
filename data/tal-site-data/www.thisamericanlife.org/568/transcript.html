<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.81" data-timestamp="0.81">In October 2003, a guy was brought into the psychiatric emergency room at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. Dr. Joel Gold was the chief attending psychiatrist that day and saw him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:00:10.88" data-timestamp="10.88">He felt that his life was essentially a reality show, that he's been recorded for years, that everyone in his life was an actor reading from a script. And he came to New York essentially to test this hypothesis.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:26.49" data-timestamp="26.49">He thought that maybe 9/11 was faked, just to get a reaction out of him on reality TV.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:00:31.56" data-timestamp="31.56">And if he came to New York, and if the World Trade Centers were still standing, he would know that that was in fact the case. If in fact they had been destroyed, then he would admit that perhaps he was delusional.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:42.98" data-timestamp="42.98">But once he got to New York, instead of visiting the Twin Towers, he walked into the United Nations and asked for asylum-- asylum from a TV show that was filming him without his consent, 24 hours a day, which, you know, is how he ended up in Bellevue.</p><p begin="00:00:57.85" data-timestamp="57.85">Dr. Gold didn't think much of this. People show up at Bellevue with lots of weird delusions all the time. And then a few months later, another guy walks in with the same idea, that he was being filmed 24/7 and broadcast around the world. And the second guy, like the first one, mentioned a film, the 1998 movie <i>The</i> <i>Truman</i> <i>Show</i>.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:01:14.90" data-timestamp="74.9">Both of them name <i>The</i> <i>Truman</i> <i>Show</i> by name. They said, my life is like <i>The</i> <i>Truman</i> <i>Show</i>.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:22.32" data-timestamp="82.32">Truman is played by Jim Carrey. He's filmed all day, every day, on a program that is broadcast to billions of people around the globe. His wife, his best friend, everybody around him is an actor. Everybody knows this is a TV show but him, until one day, he starts to see clues that make him suspicious.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:39.52" data-timestamp="99.52">And just to be clear, you're not saying that the Truman Show necessarily triggered this, like, people watched <i>The</i> <i>Truman</i> <i>Show</i> and suddenly something in their brain snaps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:01:46.01" data-timestamp="106.01">Yeah, exactly. On the contrary, I think. It's just when people are becoming psychotic, perhaps if you've seen the movie and that's kicking around in your head, you might say, yes, this is what's happening to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:58.22" data-timestamp="118.22">If your psychosis includes both paranoia and a sense that you are very, very important-- what psychiatrists called grandiosity-- 30 years ago, you know, you might think that the CIA or the KGB is watching you all the time. These days, you have another possible explanation-- reality TV. A few months later, a third patient showed up with the same delusion, and a few months after that, a fourth. Dr. Gold started calling it <i>The</i> <i>Truman</i> <i>Show</i> delusion. He's written a book about it with his brother Ian called <i>Suspicious</i> <i>Minds</i>. In one case in the book, a patient, a super smart guy, an academic, very altruistic, believed that he was part of an elaborate game show and the world was watching him and betting on everything that he did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:02:37.56" data-timestamp="157.56">And this was a really fun thing that everyone would be doing online. And the monies collected would go to charities all over the world. And then every single human being on earth would be given some amount of money, and the world would be bettered for it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.09" data-timestamp="174.09">One of the things that he included in his delusion, you write in your book, is that he has the thought that he actually was the mastermind who created this game show that he was on, and that he controlled it and he knew the rules when he had originally created the show. But somehow he had forgotten that, and all the rules-- which is so interesting, because, of course, it's true. Like he did invent the game show. And the only fact that he's missing is that it's not real. It's all in his own head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:03:22.87" data-timestamp="202.87">That's, yeah, an interesting way of putting it. It is kind of fantastical.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:28.10" data-timestamp="208.1">And heartbreaking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:03:29.42" data-timestamp="209.42">It is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:30.09" data-timestamp="210.09">Like part of him knows he made it up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:03:32.08" data-timestamp="212.08">Absolutely.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:32.33" data-timestamp="212.33">But he can't grasp the whole reality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:03:34.00" data-timestamp="214">He does not remember. At one point, he suggests that he told his best friends, "This is what I'm going to do. You're going to run the show. But you will now hypnotize me, and I will forget what we're talking about now so we can do this really good deed for humanity."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:56.04" data-timestamp="236.04">Some of these patients respond to treatment, some don't-- same as with other delusions and psychoses. But Dr. Gold says that if they do come back to reality--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:04:04.67" data-timestamp="244.67">Some feel great relief if they've been persecuted. It's quite embarrassing, if you think about it. Every moment of your life, I mean, when you're in the shower, literally everything is filmed, so they feel quite good about it. At the same time, there's a certain sadness that they're not particularly important.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:24.63" data-timestamp="264.63">Do they miss being the most famous person in the world?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Joel Gold</h4><p begin="00:04:29.30" data-timestamp="269.3">No question, there are some who feel that that's a huge loss. At the same time, I think they return to the notion that they're mentally ill, which in and of itself is an unfortunate and sad thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.78" data-timestamp="284.78">Psychosis aside, I think all this illustrates so clearly there's a downside and an upside to being on stage for the whole world to see, a human spectacle against your will. And today on our program, we have people who became just that. They have an experience so few of us have, that we all get to see from afar. They are on display for everybody, and not because they chose it. What that feels like, the positive parts and the negative side and the real life reality, the whole thing, from the WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: I Am the Eggplant</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:24.83" data-timestamp="324.83">Act One, "I Am the Eggplant," koo koo kachoob. In the TV genre that's devoted to pure human spectacle, reality TV, you know, people fight drunkenly in hot tubs. They eat live spiders for money. But none of that can hold a candle to this show, a show that aired in Japan all the way back in 1998. It was called <i>Susunu!</i> <i>Denpa</i> <i>Shonen</i>. And one of its segments in particular got the attention of our producers, Stephanie Foo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:05:53.41" data-timestamp="353.41">The segment is called "Sweepstakes Life." It starts the way a lot of these shows do, with a bunch of people at an audition. One guy beats out everyone else. He's 22 years old, a comedian just starting out in his career. His name is Nasubi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:06:09.65" data-timestamp="369.65"> Nasubi.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:06:10.60" data-timestamp="370.6">Nasubi means "eggplant" in Japanese, a nickname he got because he has a long face. The producers tell him they have a unique idea for a show, something they've never tried before. It may or may not air. But if it does, he'll be the star. He'll be famous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:06:26.26" data-timestamp="386.26"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:06:29.82" data-timestamp="389.82">The producers blindfold him, put him in a car, and take him to a small apartment. Then they tell him to take his clothes off.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasubi</h4><p begin="00:06:37.00" data-timestamp="397">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:06:38.82" data-timestamp="398.82">That wipes the grin off his face.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasubi</h4><p begin="00:06:43.18" data-timestamp="403.18">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:45.15" data-timestamp="405.15">It wasn't just my personal sort of shame or issues about nudity, per say. My dad is a cop. And when I first announced that my career choice was going to be comedy, he was not thrilled. And we had to go through some things to get him around to the idea. He said the one thing that I must never do in public is strip.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:07:08.40" data-timestamp="428.4">Oh, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasubi</h4><p begin="00:07:09.10" data-timestamp="429.1">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:07:09.34" data-timestamp="429.34">So there I was. And then this guilt towards-- I was breaking the promise to my father as publicly as possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:07:19.58" data-timestamp="439.58">But he strips. He grabs a pillow, holds it over his groin, and looks around the room. There's no chair in the room, no bed, just a coffee table and magazines, tons of magazines. The producers tell him that from now on, if he wants food, clothes, he will have to win them by entering sweepstakes in those magazines. They give him postcards to send in for prize drawings. He'll be freed from the apartment after he wins 1 million yen, or $10,000 worth of prizes.</p><p begin="00:07:53.69" data-timestamp="473.69">Until then, he isn't allowed any outside contact with the world. He can't call his family. He can't talk to friends. And oh, they tell him, "Don't forget to put tapes in this little camera here every two hours and record yourself. We'll come pick up the tapes once a day." And then they say, "All right, later."

But he didn't have anything better to do, so he sat down and wrote, and soon was entering 200 to 300 contests a day. And while he waited for prizes to arrive, he had no food. Nasubi got frighteningly thin very quickly.

The staff got together and would give me basically a very simple little bread each day. So I had bread and water, essentially, for the first two weeks. But then as soon as the results started to come in, then that stopped and everything shifted over entirely to the things that I could win through sweepstakes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:09:05.83" data-timestamp="545.83">After two weeks, he finally won some sugary drinks.

But then he stopped short. He realized he didn't own a pot to cook the rice in. But after a couple days of failed attempts, he figured out that if he put some rice in an empty drink container and left it near his single gas burner, it eventually turned into a kind of porridge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasubi</h4><p begin="00:10:17.48" data-timestamp="617.48">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:10:19.37" data-timestamp="619.37">And I could eat delicious rice every day. I remember how good that felt. And then there was the slow trepidation as it started to vanish. And then it ran out. And the only food substitute that I had been able to win in a sweepstakes was dog food. You know, after, let's say, six weeks of eating dog food, when then I was able to get more rice and it arrived, I really felt a special kind of joy at being able to return to humanity in a sense and taste delicious rice again every day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:10:56.45" data-timestamp="656.45">Back then, there was a kind of sweepstakes mania in Japan. The country was in the middle of a terrible recession. And some wondered whether one could subsist entirely on their winnings. And so when <i>Sweepstakes</i> <i>Life</i> debuted, almost immediately after Nasubi was first shut in the room, it was an instant hit. Nasubi had no idea. He didn't even know he was on TV. He believed what the producers had told him, that he'd record some videotapes, and maybe someday it would end up on the air.</p><p begin="00:11:26.81" data-timestamp="686.81">On television, Nasubi's groin was hidden by a purple cartoon eggplant that floated around as he moved. Everything he did was accentuated with ridiculous "boing boing" sound effects, and puffy rainbow letters floated above his head.</p><p begin="00:11:41.33" data-timestamp="701.33">[BOINGING]</p><p begin="00:11:43.48" data-timestamp="703.48">[GAME SHOW NOISES]</p><p begin="00:11:45.31" data-timestamp="705.31">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p><p begin="00:11:47.59" data-timestamp="707.59"></p><p begin="00:11:49.07" data-timestamp="709.07">But these effects popped up just as often when Nasubi was despondent. The show took every chance to poke fun at him, whether he was muttering to himself, dancing around, or doing terrible headstands-- you know, the dumb stuff you do when you think no one's watching, except people were.</p><p begin="00:12:04.97" data-timestamp="724.97">For context, in the US, <i>Game</i> <i>of</i> <i>Thrones</i> usually has around 9 million viewers. Nasubi had 16 million in a country less than half the size of ours. People thought Nasubi was the funniest comedy act they'd ever seen. And I have to admit, as a viewer, once in a while, when Nasubi got something really awesome in the mail, I couldn't help it. I laughed, too, even though I knew how much he was suffering. I couldn't help it. His unfiltered joy is contagious. Though as a foreigner watching <i>Sweepstakes</i> <i>Life</i>, most of the time, when the studio audience cracked up, I felt sick. I thought, what could possibly be funny about this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasubi</h4><p begin="00:12:45.35" data-timestamp="765.35">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:12:47.38" data-timestamp="767.38">I mean, that was maybe a time when Japan was going through some things and they needed to sort of do that. Roughly 50 years of prosperity has finally come to a close, and people really uncertain about their futures. You know, I think people just tended to watch the show and say, you know, I got it bad. But look at poor Nasubi. He's got it worse.</p><p begin="00:13:08.10" data-timestamp="788.1">Now there's a lot more awareness of the weak and of people who need extra support. I don't think I think the average Japanese today would think it was funny that there was a guy naked in a room somewhere.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:13:28.57" data-timestamp="808.57">Nasubi won hundreds of prizes. But many of them were useless to him-- Spice Girls tickets, for example, or a TV with no cable, or a bicycle. He sent away for clothes, but never won anything he could wear. He was naked the entire time he was in that room, for the entire show. And as the weeks went by, then months, Nasubi started to look less and less sane. He grew a beard. His hair was wild. And he started talking differently, slower.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasubi</h4><p begin="00:13:59.37" data-timestamp="839.37">[SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:14:03.39" data-timestamp="843.39">He'd make really creepy faces into the camera.

It took him almost an entire year. But at last, he'd completed the challenge. When he reached his goal, producers didn't tell him anything about it.

Back in the '90s, he was considered the king of Japanese reality TV.

But the fact of the matter is, what Tsuchiya's saying is true. <i>Denpa</i> <i>Shonen</i> did really capture humanity in a rare way. A way you don't ever really see, even on the craziest of American reality TV shows. Hungry, starving, alone, unaware that he was being watched, Nasubi was totally innocent and totally animal. Of course, it's cruel to bring a human being to that point. And it takes a special kind of cruelty to take someone at their most vulnerable and add wacky sound effects to their suffering.</p><p begin="00:28:04.71" data-timestamp="1684.71">A couple weeks into Nasubi's challenge, before he won any solid food, when he was hungriest, a delivery man came to the door bearing ramen and stir-fried vegetables. "It's 1,700 yen all together," the man said. "I don't have any money," Nasubi replied. "Sorry, my mistake," the delivery man said, and left. Nasubi sat there, his head hung, a contestant in a real-life hunger game, the smell of ramen lingering in the air.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:41.19" data-timestamp="1721.19">Stephanie Foo is one of the producers of our program.

<h3>Act Two: I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watching Me</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:01.69" data-timestamp="1741.69">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, "Human Spectacle." We have stories of people who go on display in front of others, lots and lots of others, even though they are not so crazy about doing that. We have arrived at Act Two of our program, Act Two, "I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watching Me."</p><p begin="00:29:22.79" data-timestamp="1762.79">We've talked a lot in today's program so far about reality TV. And of course, what makes reality TV entertaining is very, very simple, and that is editing. Editing-- if they just set up cameras and showed you all 24 hours in anybody's day, you know, how interesting could that possibly be? Well, here is a story of somebody trying just that, a story of everyday people being treated as human spectacle and being treated that way precisely because of their everyday-ness. Ariel Sabar explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ariel Sabar</h4><p begin="00:29:49.01" data-timestamp="1789.01">Here's how it worked. On a Tuesday morning in the spring of 1949, a seven-year-old boy named Raymond Birch was fast asleep in his bed. His mother walked into his bedroom and said, Raymond, time to get up for school. When the boy opened his eyes, he saw a scientist with a clipboard and timer standing in the corner of his room. The scientist, a stranger to the boy, just stared, didn't say a word. The boy squirmed out of bed and reached for his clothes. The scientist wrote, "7:01 AM-- Raymond picked up a sock."</p><p begin="00:30:27.13" data-timestamp="1827.13">In the late 1940s and early '50s, scientists followed kids in houses, schoolyards, and streets across the town of Oskaloosa, Kansas, taking pages of notes on the littlest things they did or said. "6:33 PM-- Bradley walked deliberately to where his sister sat playing with a puppy and hit her on the head, twice, just as hard as he could hit. His sister looked very surprised and annoyed." "11:06 AM-- Fred skidded on the floor so that he fell with his body partially under the sway. He yelled, 'whoops,' and then lay still, since he saw the swing coming back over him." "11:37 AM-- Margaret's mother asked, why can't you play with your dolls and let that go? Margaret kept on painting the pillars before her, neither looking at her mother nor answering her."</p><p begin="00:31:15.81" data-timestamp="1875.81">All of this was happening under the watch of a University of Kansas psychologist named Roger Barker, who has bend on taking his field in a radically new direction. Because psychology was still struggling in those days to be taken seriously as a science, most of Barker's colleagues imitated other kinds of scientists, doing lots of experiments in labs. But none of this made sense to Barker. Humans didn't live in laboratories. They lived in the real world.</p><p begin="00:31:41.31" data-timestamp="1901.31">And that's where Barker want to study them-- in the wild, the way a botanist looked at flowers in the field or a primatologist tracked apes through a forest. So when the University of Kansas called in 1947 and asked Barker if he wanted to chair its psychology department, Barker said, I'll take the job, but on one condition. You find me a small town. A dean at the school said he knew just the place-- Oskaloosa, population 725.</p><p begin="00:32:15.15" data-timestamp="1935.15">When Roger Barker first drove up into the hills of northeastern Kansas to see Oskaloosa, he must have been beside himself. The place was a Norman Rockwell painting-- not too rich, not too poor, sturdy families in modest houses. It was the picture of middle America.</p><p begin="00:32:32.15" data-timestamp="1952.15">Barker wanted to study what he called "the naturally occurring behavior of free-ranging persons." And to do that, he told his field workers to become part of the scenery-- visible and friendly, but not obtrusive. The last thing we want to do, he said, is give people the guinea pig feeling.</p><p begin="00:32:50.23" data-timestamp="1970.23">Barker took his own advice and moved his entire family to Oskaloosa. They settled in a beat-up house near the town square, joined the Presbyterian church, and became active in the town's social and civic organizations. And that left Barker just as exposed as the Oskaloosans he planned to put under his microscope. "You'll be watching us," a local mother told the researchers one day. "But don't forget, we'll be watching you."</p><p begin="00:33:15.49" data-timestamp="1995.49">One of the first things Barker wanted to do in Oskaloosa was to document a day in the life of an ordinary boy. Barker didn't have a hypothesis about the boy or about seven-year-olds. He wasn't testing for anything in particular. He wanted only to show the world that following a kid for a day could produce a ton of interesting data. Scientists could later break down that data in an infinite number of ways, depending on their interests and the goals of their research, which was how little Raymond Birch woke up that morning to find a scientist standing over him.</p><p begin="00:33:45.98" data-timestamp="2025.98">On that Tuesday, April 26, 1949, eight researchers, taking turns like runners in a relay race, followed Raymond for 13 hours straight. The book that came out of it, <i>One</i> <i>Boy's</i> <i>Day</i>, was 435 pages long. It had an entry for nearly every minute of Raymond's day. The researchers tried record not just Raymond's words and movements, but also his perceptions, motives, and feelings.</p><p begin="00:34:12.82" data-timestamp="2052.82">They noted that Raymond mumbled with a mouthful of toast at breakfast. They followed him as he walked with his mom through her job at the county clerk's office, and looked on as he drew a picture of a cowboy with a long beard. They watched Raymond find a baseball bat in the grass and pick it up.</p><p begin="00:34:27.82" data-timestamp="2067.82">"Oh, boy," he said, according to their notes. "He tossed a stone in the air and swung, but accidentally clipped a flag pole-- 8:24 AM. This made a wonderful hollow ringing noise, so he proceeded to hit the flag pole again. 8:25 AM-- He went around and round and around the pole, hitting it with a bat as he did so, until he became so dizzy that he fell down, bat and all."</p><p begin="00:34:54.85" data-timestamp="2094.85">Even before the book about Raymond's day was published, Barker felt it was destined for greatness. It would find its way onto campuses as a staple of psychology courses, he thought, and into the hands of artists, novelists, and laymen interested in the cultural scene. "We believe it will become a sort of classic and be in demand for a long time," he wrote in a January 1951 letter.</p><p begin="00:35:16.42" data-timestamp="2116.42">But <i>One</i> <i>Boy's</i> <i>Day</i> never took off. And by April 1959, Barker, crestfallen, asked Harper &amp; Row to ship him the 70 remainders languishing in its warehouse. Part of the trouble was simply the book's premise. In its defiant first sentence, Barker calls the book, "a scientific document."</p><p begin="00:35:36.15" data-timestamp="2136.15">But other scientists had a hard time seeing that. The book was just a tick-tock chronology of Raymond's day. There wasn't any theory or analysis. And this annoyed many of the reviewers in serious academic journals. One reviewer wrote, "The reader is struck by the fact that he is encountering only raw data. How can one evaluate such materials without a theoretical framework?" In other words, what does it mean?</p><p begin="00:36:05.81" data-timestamp="2165.81">Barker lived in Oskaloosa the rest of his life. But he abandoned his day in the life studies after just a few years. There were more revealing and less labor-intensive ways, he discovered, to study human beings in their natural habitats.</p><p begin="00:36:19.26" data-timestamp="2179.26">Today, field studies of naturally occurring behavior are no more common in psychology than they were in Barker's time. The costs and logistics are just too staggering. One rare but recent Barker-like effort was conducted by UCLA's Center on the Everyday Life of Families. Researchers there embedded in the homes of 32 middle class families in Los Angeles for a week and videotaped nearly every waking minute.</p><p begin="00:36:44.26" data-timestamp="2204.26">But the ratio of cost and effort to interesting results remains as lopsided today as it was in Barker's time. <i>The</i> <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> reported that, quote, "After more than $9 million and untold thousands of hours of video watching, the researchers found that, well, life in these trenches is exactly what it looks like-- a fire shower of stress, multitasking, and mutual nitpicking."</p><p begin="00:37:08.08" data-timestamp="2228.08">One guy in particular who is not a big fan of these studies? Raymond Birch, the boy. I tracked him down a few years ago. His real name is Gary Morgan, and he's now a retired utility worker in his early 70s living in Pennsylvania. Roger Barker autographed Gary's copy of <i>One</i> <i>Boy's</i> <i>Day</i> and personally inscribed it, calling Gary its, quote, "real author." But Gary has yet to get past its first pages.</p><p begin="00:37:32.60" data-timestamp="2252.6">"I have to say, why is this interesting?" He told me. "There's nothing happening in this book as far as I can tell. What is it going to tell them that I was standing there, chewing on my fingernails?"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:53.92" data-timestamp="2273.92">Ariel Sabar is the author of <i>The</i> <i>Outsider</i>, a biography of Roger Parker.

David Segal tells the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:38:22.01" data-timestamp="2302.01">Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill were a sketch comedy act back in the early 1960s, playing small clubs around the country-- mostly in Los Angeles, where they lived. They were married. They still are, actually. And they were struggling.

We ran down to The Horn in Santa Monica. We broke it in. It got a lovely, lovely reaction. And we told everybody. In fact, I think I sky wrote it over Hollywood. We're on <i>The</i> <i>Ed</i> <i>Sullivan</i> <i>Show</i>, yahoo.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mitzi Mccall</h4><p begin="00:39:26.72" data-timestamp="2366.72">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charlie Brill</h4><p begin="00:39:27.19" data-timestamp="2367.19">And we were on our way.

This was a chance to meet a few of their idols who'd be on the show that night, too-- people like Tessie O'Shea, Georgia Brown, who were both big musical theater stars.

Mitzi later wrote for sitcoms, like <i>Alf</i>. Charlie eventually landed a leading role on a detective show called <i>Silk</i> <i>Stalkings</i>, which ran on the USA network for nine years. They have a daughter, whom they adore. No knock on <i>Alf</i>, but it gradually dawned on Mitzi and Charlie that on February 9, 1964, they were part of something seismic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charlie Brill</h4><p begin="00:55:18.84" data-timestamp="3318.84">We were in the midst of greatness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mitzi Mccall</h4><p begin="00:55:21.07" data-timestamp="3321.07">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charlie Brill</h4><p begin="00:55:21.90" data-timestamp="3321.9">We didn't know it.
