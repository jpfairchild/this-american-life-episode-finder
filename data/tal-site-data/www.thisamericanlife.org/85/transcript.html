<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.64" data-timestamp="0.64">The argument is simple. Why have an eagle as your national bird? The eagle is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly. He sits on the tree branch, watches other birds swoop down for fish. Once they grab the fish, the eagle chases them, steals the fish. Also, he's a coward. At least that is the argument that Benjamin Franklin lays out in a letter dated January 26, 1784.</p><p begin="00:00:26.27" data-timestamp="26.27">"It would be far better if the symbol of the new United States of America were a turkey," Franklin writes. Quote, "The turkey is, in comparison, a much more respectable, and withal a true, original native of America. Eagles have been found in all countries, but turkey was peculiar to ours. He is besides, though a little vain and silly, a bird of courage and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of British guards who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on."</p><p begin="00:00:56.19" data-timestamp="56.19">A modern American reads this and thinks, bird of courage?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:01:00.21" data-timestamp="60.21">Well the wild turkey of the 18th century was very different from the butterball turkey of Thanksgiving day dinner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:07.24" data-timestamp="67.24">That's Jack Hitt. He is one of contributing editors here at <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. He has written about the Benjamin Franklin papers in <i>The New York Times.</i> He writes about history, biology and pretty much anything else he wants to in various national magazines. And he offered to explain this turkey mystery.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:01:22.10" data-timestamp="82.1">If you look at the label of a Wild Turkey bottle, you're probably closer to Ben Franklin's turkey than the one in the grocery store. It's all leg. It's fast. It's speedy. It's an athletic bird. It has almost no breast whatsoever. And if you've hunted them, they're incredibly quick and smart, whereas over the centuries, the turkey was eventually bred into this enormous walking piece of breast meat.</p><p begin="00:01:59.35" data-timestamp="119.35">The turkey itself is so front-heavy-- I think in some cases, they even have trouble walking towards the end.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:06.51" data-timestamp="126.51">You're saying that we as a nation have altered the turkey from a smart, fast cunning animal into a stupid, heavy one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:02:15.00" data-timestamp="135">What we've done really is hybridize it to the point where it's just basically a living dinner waiting to get on the table. There's really nothing about the turkey from its birth until its death that is about anything except being a meal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:35.41" data-timestamp="155.41">And is the thing about poultry, that probably more than any other animal, we've turned birds, chicken, turkey, into what we want them to be. Which means that chickens and turkeys, more than other animals, are a mirror of ourselves, of our desires, of our needs. When we tell stories about poultry, we're telling stories about ourselves. And given this, and given the history of the turkey in America, maybe Benjamin Franklin was right. Maybe it should be the symbol of our nation.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:06.13" data-timestamp="186.13">In a way it begs the metaphor. I mean he's saying that this should be the symbol of our country. And I wonder if maybe it should, depending on what you think of the United States of America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:03:17.51" data-timestamp="197.51">You're saying that if we had chosen it 200 years ago, it would have neatly tracked our national growth. Are you saying that now, we're more like the contemporary turkey than we were like Ben Franklin's turkey?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:31.42" data-timestamp="211.42">I guess I am saying that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:03:33.89" data-timestamp="213.89">That we're fat and out of shape and lazy and somewhat retarded?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:38.94" data-timestamp="218.94">I mean I admit, it's a little post-Vietnam syndrome. I'm going to suggest this. A little unfashionably, post-Vietnam syndrome.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:03:52.74" data-timestamp="232.74">Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International. It is <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. And we, all of us, we stand at this moment poised between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We are in the weeks during the year when Americans consume more poultry than at any other time, which means it's time for <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life's</i> annual Poultry Slam. Stories about chickens, turkeys, ducks, fowl all kinds, and their mysterious hold over us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:23.79" data-timestamp="263.79">Now Jack, although you're happily, and at our bidding, discussing Ben Franklin and turkeys, that is not the reason why you're here with us today, is it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:04:32.08" data-timestamp="272.08">No, actually I'm here for another poultry-related subject.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:34.51" data-timestamp="274.51">Let me just ask you to just give us a little hint. Just drop a phrase or two.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:04:39.93" data-timestamp="279.93">Two words Ira, Chicken Little.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:42.90" data-timestamp="282.9">Chicken Little. Adults all over America are turning off their radios. You think chicken little is that much of a draw?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:04:53.64" data-timestamp="293.64">Let me try that again. Two words Ira. Avian supernumeraries.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:04.00" data-timestamp="304">Well, Act One of our program today, Chicken Diva, in which we hear the story of yes, avian supernumeraries.</p><p begin="00:05:12.43" data-timestamp="312.43">Act Two, Headless Chicken in Topless Bar. Actually, there is no topless bar in that act. We just like the sound of that. But there is a headless chicken and a question. What does the headless chicken say about us?</p><p begin="00:05:25.89" data-timestamp="325.89">Act Three, Duck Warrior. Michael Lewis explains the natural way to hunt duck and his family's way.</p><p begin="00:05:32.06" data-timestamp="332.06">Act Four, Trying to Respect the Chicken, the story of one woman's quest to give chicken the honor and dignity they are rarely accorded, even though the chickens resist her efforts. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Chicken Diva</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:51.12" data-timestamp="351.12">Act One, Chicken Diva. Chickens are what we make of them. For further evidence of this, we have this story from our contributing editor, Jack Hitt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:06:02.02" data-timestamp="362.02">Oddly enough, it wasn't Susan who was obsessed with chickens. It was Kenny, a pal who worked backstage at the 92 Street Y in New York. His house was filled with chicken cups, chicken masks, porcelain chickens. He got the whole staff onto chickens, including Susan. For a time there in the '80's, poultry-related jokes and references became the fast way to get a laugh at the Y. I guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens, but Susan Vitucci saw something else, their potential greatness, their hidden beauty, their grandeur.</p><p begin="00:06:37.19" data-timestamp="397.19">One day, she glued together some finger puppets for a 10-minute rendition of the Chicken Little story for her nephew. That was 14 years ago. Today, it is a full-length opera, enjoyed by a cult following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe or small theater. It's still performed with finger puppets, but now it has a complete score written by a noted composer, Henry Krieger, who did <i>Dreamgirls,</i> and this season has a hit on Broadway, a musical called <i>Side Show.</i> The Chicken Little opera he wrote with Susan Vitucci is called <i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl</i>. Needless to say, that's F-O-W-L.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:07:12.53" data-timestamp="432.53">Well, we were going to start with the opening, [SPEAKING ITALIAN] We are the Clothespin Repertory Theater. And we have a special singing guest for you, which I don't know--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:07:25.56" data-timestamp="445.56">Susan and I are sitting at Henry's baby grand piano. Henry's guest is his Maltese terrier named Toby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:07:31.99" data-timestamp="451.99">Perhaps Toby would be kind enough to join me over here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:07:34.60" data-timestamp="454.6">Yeah, would she sit on your lap for this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:07:36.38" data-timestamp="456.38">Yeah, let's see what we can do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:07:39.69" data-timestamp="459.69">OK, listen carefully because once Toby gets going, he actually harmonizes with Henry and Susan.</p><p begin="00:07:45.78" data-timestamp="465.78">[MUSIC - LOVE'S FOWL] [DOG BARKING]</p><p begin="00:08:07.93" data-timestamp="487.93">You may have noticed that this libretto is an Italian, just like a real opera.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:08:12.08" data-timestamp="492.08">Before, it was just a bunch of puppets and a box, with a good idea. And then suddenly, since it went into Italian, it became something bigger than what it had been. And it's because when it's in English, we all know it, and it's really not that interesting. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. As soon as it's in Italian, it gives us enough distance that we can come in. It makes us-- it's like the lover who doesn't want you. You don't want anybody more than you want the one who doesn't want you. Right? And it's sort of the same thing.</p><p begin="00:08:48.00" data-timestamp="528">[MUSIC - LOVE'S FOWL]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:09:12.41" data-timestamp="552.41">You may recall that when you last heard of Little, back in kindergarten, she was just an average, barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on our head, which she mistakenly understood to be the sky falling. Her alarms excited her friends, Goosey Loosey, Turkey Lurkey, and Ducky Lucky. And they join her for a journey to the King to tell him the important news. On the way, they meet up with Sly Fox. Little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner, literally as it turns out.

It's just an acorn. So the enlightened Chicken Little returns to her coop, and that's where the story ends. Like Goldilocks and so many children's fables, the actual meaning of the story is obscure. What are we to take away from Little's experience? I like to think that Little is rewarded with life precisely because she went off on this Quixotic mission, totally in the grip of a wrong idea. By clinging to that belief, however crazy, she managed to free herself from the ugly Darwinian world of the barnyard and of its mandate, eat or be eaten.</p><p begin="00:10:21.90" data-timestamp="621.9">[MUSIC - LOVE'S FOWL]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:10:37.04" data-timestamp="637.04">The children's fable barely figures into the story.

<h3>Act Two: Headless Chicken In Topless Bar</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:44.28" data-timestamp="1244.28">Act Two, Headless Chicken in Topless Bar. Lloyd grew up in rural Virginia. His parents were city people who moved to the farm, people who decided that they'd raise goats, pigs, about 100 chickens. They would slaughter the birds by chopping off their heads with an axe. Now, we're going to get a little explicit here, so just be warned.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lloyd Natoff</h4><p begin="00:21:03.54" data-timestamp="1263.54">It's a little nerve wracking because as soon as you cut the head off, a second or two will elapse, and then chicken explodes and starts to spazz out. And sometimes, they'll just lie on the ground, jerking and moving, but other times, they'll actually run and hop. And it's quite a sight because they're headless. Blood is coming out of the top of their neck. And I mean if you have 30 of these to do, they're going to disperse over a pretty large area. And I can remember chasing them, and frequently they would do evasive maneuvers. When you would try to reach down and grab them, they would jump to one side. And it seemed almost as if they could tell that you were there, which they couldn't. They didn't have a head.</p><p begin="00:22:04.01" data-timestamp="1324.01">We tried a lot of different techniques to deal with this messy situation. And I can remember one time we decided we'd cut the head off, and we'd throw them into a 55 gallon drum. But that was a mess, and it was really noisy because they bang around. And you can only put so many in there, and the blood starts to collect. And so that was really-- that didn't work.</p><p begin="00:22:35.38" data-timestamp="1355.38">I remember one time, my uncle, Louis, came, and he was helping us do this. And he had heard that if you break the chicken's neck, as opposed to cutting it off, that somehow circumvents this reaction. And they don't spazz out. So he felt that the way to do that would be to grab the chicken by the head and swing it around his head. And he picked one up and swung it around his head a few times. And sure enough, the animal was dead, and it didn't go into this reaction.</p><p begin="00:23:12.76" data-timestamp="1392.76">And so he stepped back, and my father picked up a chicken and did the same thing. And as he's swinging it around, I looked over at Louis, and I noticed that there was this line of chicken [BLEEP] that was going across his glasses because the bird had gone to the bathroom while my dad was swinging it around. And so we didn't really try that anymore, and we went back to the fence method.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:43.97" data-timestamp="1423.97">If you spend enough time around chickens, and you are a halfway empathetic or observant person, I think it's inevitable that at certain times, in certain ways, the boundary between the human world and the chicken world will get blurred. That happened to Lloyd.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lloyd Natoff</h4><p begin="00:23:58.44" data-timestamp="1438.44">Chickens are very hierarchical, and the higher chickens-- well, the chickens want to get to the highest part of the roost. And so there'd be constant fighting to get to the top, chickens damaging each other, pecking each other. But there would always be one or two chickens that had very few feathers. And because they were always being picked on, henpecked, they were the bottom of the pecking order. And these chickens, I felt sorry for them because it looked very uncomfortable, and I didn't like to see them suffering.</p><p begin="00:24:38.44" data-timestamp="1478.44">But I also felt-- they evoked a bit of anger in me because they were always hanging out in the corner or under foot. And they didn't go out in the yard usually. They would just hang out inside the house. And frequently, I think they just brought out the bully in a 10-year-old boy.</p><p begin="00:25:12.89" data-timestamp="1512.89">I had some anger that I would-- and I'm ashamed to admit, these henpecked animals would bring it out in me. And I would kick them them away if they were under foot and stuff like that. It was a mixture of feeling sorry for them and feeling derision.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:37.43" data-timestamp="1537.43">One way to look at the world is this. There's a life continuum. One one side, at the extreme end, you have plants and insects and stuff that most of us feel no remorse about killing or mistreating. On the other side of the continuum, at the other extreme, you have dogs and cats and baby seals and human beings, animals we do not feel free to just kill or eat or be cruel to. And the question is, where are chickens located on this continuum?</p><p begin="00:26:07.71" data-timestamp="1567.71">At different points during our conversation, Lloyd put chickens at different places on the continuum. Sometimes he said that he felt their pain. He empathized with their pain. Sometimes he went on these long tirades about how stupid chickens are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lloyd Natoff</h4><p begin="00:26:21.24" data-timestamp="1581.24">The thing about chickens is they like eating eggs, but they don't know that the things they're laying are eggs. You get the occasional chicken that will eat eggs from the areas where they lay them, but by and large, that's not that common. But if you take an egg and throw it on the floor, all the chickens will run over and eat it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:43.14" data-timestamp="1603.14">That's horrifying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lloyd Natoff</h4><p begin="00:26:51.37" data-timestamp="1611.37">I'm feeling some anguish about how I treated some of these chickens, chickens that are long gone, chickens that were only with me for a year.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:02.66" data-timestamp="1622.66">Chickens that didn't have names.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lloyd Natoff</h4><p begin="00:27:04.41" data-timestamp="1624.41">Chickens that individually meant nothing to me.

<h3>Act Three: Duck Warrior</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:23.39" data-timestamp="1763.39"> It's <i>This American Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on the theme. Today's program, during the weeks between Thanksgiving Christmas, the weeks of greatest poultry consumption in America, it is our annual Poultry Slam. Stories of chicken, turkeys, ducks, fowl of all kind, and how we turn them into mirrors of ourselves. We have arrived at Act Three of our program, Duck Warrior.</p><p begin="00:29:49.31" data-timestamp="1789.31">If how we raise chickens says a lot about ourselves, how we hunt them says just as much. We have this account of one family's mortal reckoning with birds, and with their own souls, from Michael Lewis.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Michael Lewis</h4><p begin="00:30:01.92" data-timestamp="1801.92">Every other year or so during Christmas vacation, I stuff myself into the camouflage suit of goose down and rubber and strike out with my father and a few of his friends into the swamps of southwestern Louisiana. For nearly 20 years now, I have followed him into the darkness, as blindly as Isaac followed Abraham, to stalk waterfowl through a gauntlet of pricker bushes, sawgrass, quick mud, snakes, mosquitoes, wild dogs, alligators and even the odd hostile cow.</p><p begin="00:30:29.93" data-timestamp="1829.93">Because everything in the Louisiana swamp seems slightly unhinged and unpredictable, it seems almost natural there that, for example, the common cow would charge an armed man as fiercely as the rabbit charged Jimmy Carter. And force him to choose between humiliating death and the indignity of shooting a cow in self-defense.</p><p begin="00:30:58.75" data-timestamp="1858.75">But of all the life in the swamp, nothing is quite so transformed by the place as the otherwise intelligent human being in pursuit of the elusive waterfowl. I suppose I should say that I see nothing immoral in this, though I often have sensed mild disapproval in people who do not hunt of people who do. As they slice deeply into the flesh of what was once an adorable little lamb, and then tear it greedily with their back teeth, these people will say something like, "How can you kill a cute little duck?" The honest answer is, sadly, that I don't.</p><p begin="00:31:39.36" data-timestamp="1899.36">Looking back on it now, I believe we began two decades ago with the ambition of one day becoming purists. The hunting purist is able to make himself think and feel like a duck or a goose. He enters the swap at 5:00 in the morning with 10 shotgun shells and returns three hours later with his legal limit of three ducks and seven geese. He can carve wooden ducks so similar to live ducks that even ducks don't notice the difference. And make noises with his mouth that sound so much like a female duck on the make that male ducks flock to him like sailors to a brothel.</p><p begin="00:32:21.43" data-timestamp="1941.43">I confess there was a time when this seemed important to us, and some of my earliest memories are of my father sitting on our back porch imitating for hours a tape recording of duck mating calls. But over the years, it became clear that no matter how long we practiced this inter-species flirtation, we would never score. As this truth dawned, we began busily to fill the gap between our ambitions and our talents with the latest in hunting technology.</p><p begin="00:32:50.55" data-timestamp="1970.55">Unable to speak with the birds, we communicated instead with each other. We carried Walkie Talkies so that we might fan out in the swamp and relay to each other various duck data. We carried flares to better see each other in the dark. And then there were the more adventurous techniques. In the late 1970's, it was widely believed, for example, that to a goose flying high in the sky, a balled up newspaper resembled a sitting goose. For several years, we spread <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> across the Louisiana wetlands, fully believing that a goose would spot the stock quotes, or perhaps an opera review, and dive down for a closer look.</p><p begin="00:33:36.02" data-timestamp="2016.02">After a while, when we had nothing to show for this but a soggy mess, we moved on from newspapers to life-sized, plastic replicas of geese. When these also failed, another theory soon made the rounds. Geese lacked size perception. A goose the size of the World Trade Center looked, to a goose, like just another goose. And so, for the next several years, our plastic replicas of the geese swelled to three or four times the size of a live goose. The added size did not help as far as I could see.</p><p begin="00:34:16.26" data-timestamp="2056.26">Only now do I understand that our many beliefs about geese would lead us inevitably to embrace the Trojan goose. The Trojan goose was advertised by one of the many companies that specialize in supplying frustrated hunters with high technology. It was, as it sounds, a hollowed out replica of a goose, complete with eye holes and large enough for two hunters to stand comfortably inside of it. It was meant to be erected in the middle of a goose feeding ground. One wing disguised a kind of trap door.</p><p begin="00:34:47.54" data-timestamp="2087.54">The idea was that once the geese gathered around their gargantuan cousin, the hunters might throw open the trap door, storm out into their unsuspecting midst and visit death and destruction upon many wild beasts. Just moments before we purchased the Trojan goose, however, something happened. I'm not sure what, perhaps some combination of self-revulsion and self-examination. At heart, we realized, we were not technologists. We were spiritualists.</p><p begin="00:35:16.88" data-timestamp="2116.88">The spiritualist is the hunter who has learned to shift the emphasis of the hunting away from the killing. He knows he can shiver ducklessly for hours behind a clump of marsh grass, expertly imitating a pintail's whistle or a mallard drake's quack with a textbook, perfect semicircle of decoys at his front and the wind and the sunrise at his back. Then, the moment he deserts his position to answer a call of nature, the ducks will descend like Japanese zeros. Looking like a cross between a flasher and an advertisement for the National Rifle Association, he will lurch for his gun and go down with a small splash as the ducks exit safely, chuckling lightly.</p><p begin="00:36:02.47" data-timestamp="2162.47">We have come very far in these 20 years. A few weeks ago, my father set off one morning on foot through the swamp. He came through a clearing and walked into several acres of ducks and geese feeding on the ground. They continued to feed while he watched. It was the largest collection of potential victims ever to sit quietly within the range of a Lewis gun. He might have murdered a flock had he been that sort of hunter. Instead, he stood in awe and watched until they all flew away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:47.32" data-timestamp="2207.32">Michael Lewis is the author of <i>Trail Fever</i> and other books.</p></div> </div>

Not only have we bred them to human specifications to meet human needs, but we've created a standard of what it means to be chicken that most chickens can never meet. That's what the standard means. We judge them as chickens, and we find them lacking.

And that means it is completely wrongheaded from the point of view of anybody who actually raises birds. Standing in the cold feed room, I had a long, long talk with George about this. George is 80 years old. He's been raising birds since, I guess, the Calvin Coolidge administration. And he says the whole fun of raising birds is raising them to the standard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George</h4><p begin="00:47:27.51" data-timestamp="2847.51">Well, like for instance, if your birds lack bone. OK, you go out and buy a bird as nearly like them as you can with better bone. But when you mate them together, you might get long-legged birds or too short. I mean you don't get what you want just by mating. It takes four, five years to gradually get it up. And by that time, they're inbred and you need new ones.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:59.43" data-timestamp="2879.43">George tells me that when he's breeding a new batch of birds, he'll hatch 65 of them, and only one or two will be anywhere near the standard of perfection.

They have better things to do with their time. And you know, there's nothing that makes you realize just how inhuman chickens are than spending a day trying to make them seem human.</p><p begin="00:57:00.74" data-timestamp="3420.74"></p></div> </div>
