<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.75" data-timestamp="0.75">There's this guy who did this thing that's extraordinary. He tried to live like a badger. And I say that in this wasn't a stunt, and he's not a crazy person. This was a sincere, thoughtful attempt to figure something out.</p><p begin="00:00:12.27" data-timestamp="12.27">The guy's name is Charles Foster. And his interest in this kind of thing really all began when he was a kid. He says a blackbird used to come into his family's suburban backyard. And he would look at it through the window of his house and stare in its eye, and it would look back at him. And he would think to himself, I know this backyard so well, but the bird knows stuff about it I don't. The bird knows all kinds of things I don't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:00:35.16" data-timestamp="35.16">And I wanted to know what that was.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:37.25" data-timestamp="37.25">And you write that you went to the library, reading everything you could on it. You mapped all the nests in your area. And you would visit them every day. And you took notes. You had a notebook where you were basically gathering your field notes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:00:48.86" data-timestamp="48.86">Yeah. I was a fanatical note-taker, a fanatical mapper. I did things which, no doubt, would sound really strange or macabre now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:58.19" data-timestamp="58.19">Like for instance, he taxidermied a dead blackbird he found. As a kid, he did this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:01:02.35" data-timestamp="62.35">Mounted with its wings outspread, and it dangled over my bed. I used to watch it circling as I went to sleep at night.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:10.58" data-timestamp="70.58">Hm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:01:11.28" data-timestamp="71.28">So yeah. And also I pickled in formalin a blackbird's brain and put it in a jar, and I would sometimes go to bed holding it in my hand.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:20.79" data-timestamp="80.79">He'd peer into it the way that you do when you're a kid, imagining, hoping something of the bird would seep into him. He'd fall asleep wishing he'd be a blackbird in his dreams.</p><p begin="00:01:30.64" data-timestamp="90.64">And as an adult, his fascination with animals continued. He became a veterinarian.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:34.84" data-timestamp="94.84">Can I ask, when you became a vet, was part of it because you wanted to get closer to animals? You wanted to understand them better?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:01:41.72" data-timestamp="101.72">It was exactly that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:42.83" data-timestamp="102.83">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:01:43.56" data-timestamp="103.56">I felt that, by putting my hands physically on animals, by knowing how they worked as machines, I would understand better those really mystical questions which I posed myself as a child.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.51" data-timestamp="119.51">Didn't work. If anything, he says, understanding animals as machines took him even further from the thing he was interested in. How do they perceive the world? What do they know?</p><p begin="00:02:09.48" data-timestamp="129.48">And so, as an adult, he began to venture out into the woods to try to live as different animals. He documented this in a book called <i>Being</i> <i>a</i> <i>Beast</i>. The most interesting section in this book is his attempt to live like a badger. Usually he would do this alone, though for a few days he went with his eight-year-old son, Tom. On a friend's farm, they made a human-sized badger home. This was a tunnel, 15-feet long, that they would sleep in. Charles says he's probably spent six weeks living underground like this over the years, sleeping during the day, awake at night like real badgers.</p><p begin="00:02:44.15" data-timestamp="164.15">And the main part of living like a badger was being low to the ground, crawling around on their hands and knees, which he knows how weird that sounds. And they did something that's so simple but changes everything. Instead of using their eyes to get around-- badgers' eyesight is terrible-- they'd blindfold themselves and use their noses.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:03:03.94" data-timestamp="183.94">When you move your nose over a small area of the forest floor, just move it an inch and you get a completely different set of smells. The ground is much, much more interesting when you smell it than when you look at it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:20.19" data-timestamp="200.19">And then everything changes when rain comes. Just describe how different the entire place is when rain finally hits.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:03:28.00" data-timestamp="208">Rain unlocks scent. So there's a massive explosion for olfactory animals of the intensity of the place. It was like the volume suddenly being turned on. And not just volume. It was a better sort of music. It was like switching to Mozart after you'd been having the piped music in the mall. It was incredibly exciting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:01.93" data-timestamp="241.93">He says it only took a few days for him and his son to be able to navigate the landscape in the woods blindfolded, using only their noses. Oak trees were good landmarks, he says, because surprisingly, they all smell different from each other. I asked him to read this passage from the book describing what the oak smelled like on those outings.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:04:17.08" data-timestamp="257.08">"Out of the tunnel, turn right. 15 yards; raw tobacco, mostly Turkish; straight on. After half a minute, wall of limes and sick in front."</p><p begin="00:04:29.93" data-timestamp="269.93">"If I had to pick one word for the badger's experience, it would be 'intimate.' Grass and bracken stems brush your face. When you're forcing a new path, the stems graze. Water shudders off grass into your eyes. Things slide away. We bustled and grunted and elbowed and pushed and pressed our noses into the ground. And even we smelled something-- the citrusy piss of the voles; the distantly maritime tang of a slug trail, like a winter rock pool; the sharp musk of a weasel; the blunter musk of an otter."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:01.87" data-timestamp="301.87">It got to the point where his eight-year-old son one day declared, I can smell mice, and then he headed off into the distance and found-- OK, not mice, but another kind of rodent-- bank voles.</p><p begin="00:05:13.38" data-timestamp="313.38">I can't talk about this book without having Charles Foster read one more excerpt. Badgers eat earthworms, so he felt compelled to at least try them. And he tried a bunch, from all over. He would put them into his mouth alive and feel them try to escape by wriggling through the gaps in his teeth, and then he'd bite.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:05:34.39" data-timestamp="334.39">"Earthworms taste of slime and the land. Worms from Chablis have a long, mineral finish. Worms from Picardy are musty; they taste of decay and splintered wood. Worms from the high Kent Weald are fresh and uncomplicated; they'd appear in the list recommended with a grilled sole. About 85% of an average badger's diet is earthworms. This fact both drains badgers of some of their charisma and makes them excitingly inaccessible."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:00.06" data-timestamp="360.06">Are those real flavors that you're describing, or are you just riffing on different potential tastes of the worms of Chablis?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:06:05.50" data-timestamp="365.5">No, no. Those are real flavors.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:07.24" data-timestamp="367.24">And then sometimes you would eat them raw and sometimes cooked?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:06:10.30" data-timestamp="370.3">Yeah. And I recommend, if anyone wants to do this, that they cook them and they have them with garlic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:19.21" data-timestamp="379.21">Charles Foster isn't just a veterinarian. He's also a practicing lawyer, and he teaches at Oxford University in England. And when he writes about the question that is at the heart of his interest with animals-- the question, what can we really understand about an animal's experience-- he parses what we can and cannot know with a lawyer's precision. He is meticulous. And he has thought about this a lot.</p><p begin="00:06:41.69" data-timestamp="401.69">He says, of course we can't know what animals think, how they conceive of themselves, how they conceive of the world. We can't really know what they feel. But with many animals, he says, we can know their physical experience because we share so much physiology with so many animals-- our limbs and eyes and noses and mouths and the way our nerves work.</p><p begin="00:07:00.36" data-timestamp="420.36">And that's why he tried to live like animals live. Putting his own body, his own physiology, into a badger's landscape seemed like his best chance of getting a tiny glimpse of what it might feel like to be a badger.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:11.72" data-timestamp="431.72">What are the moments that you feel like you got closest to the thing you were seeking?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Charles Foster</h4><p begin="00:07:19.04" data-timestamp="439.04">There was the moment of-- there was the moment when I said to myself, there's a tree there because there's the smell of a tree, rather than there's a tree there because I looked at it last Thursday and I know that it should be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:38.60" data-timestamp="458.6">Mostly this did not work. He's the first to point that out. As soon as he would stand up and see the world again with his head 6 feet in the air, it all went away. The visual world reasserted itself. His head filled with thoughts that a badger would never think.</p><p begin="00:07:53.24" data-timestamp="473.24">But I could understand why he gave so many years to this project, even though he knew all along it was such a long shot. It's too exciting to leave yourself and try to be something so different.</p><p begin="00:08:05.01" data-timestamp="485.01">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, Becoming a Badger. We have two stories for you about trying to become something you are not. One of these stories is about a guy from France. One is about a dog. In each of the stories, they set out to become different from what they are, and they do it by just jumping into the new identity, into the new thing they want to be, pretending to be that thing, and hoping it sticks. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:08:31.38" data-timestamp="511.38"></p><p begin="00:08:35.33" data-timestamp="515.33"></p></div> </div>

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:40.75" data-timestamp="520.75">Act One, Je Suis Ici Toute La Semaine.</p><p begin="00:08:45.37" data-timestamp="525.37">So I heard about this guy. His name is Gad Elmaleh, and he's basically the most famous stand-up comedian in France. He plays arenas in France. He gets mobbed everywhere by fans and paparazzi, yadda, yadda. Yadda, yadda's actually appropriate. Gad is known as the Jerry Seinfeld of France. Just to give you a sense, this is the beginning of one of his most popular concert videos. It's from 2010.</p><p begin="00:09:05.17" data-timestamp="545.17">[MUSIC - "DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH" BY MICHAEL JACKSON]</p><p begin="00:09:07.67" data-timestamp="547.67">[CROWD SCREAMING]</p><p begin="00:09:09.66" data-timestamp="549.66">Yes, that's a Michael Jackson song they got the rights to. Gad does this rock star thing where his silhouette hits the stage before he does, and then his silhouette dances around to the music, tantalizing the crowd until the spotlight hits him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:09:23.64" data-timestamp="563.64">Bonsoir!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:27.14" data-timestamp="567.14">Here's how famous he is. His initial jokes are about being famous-- how freaked out his fans get, meeting somebody as famous as he is. But about a year ago, Gad embarked on this quest. He decided he was going to try to make it as a successful comic here in America in English.</p><p begin="00:09:45.04" data-timestamp="585.04">This is an incredibly difficult and totally unnecessary thing for anybody to try to do. In France, everybody knows Gad Elmaleh. It's going great for him. And he's giving all that up to start again at the bottom, doing small clubs and venues. He has to reinvent how he does his whole job. And he's struggling. It's simultaneously audacious and very humble.</p><p begin="00:10:06.95" data-timestamp="606.95">I have to say, I'm kind of a sucker for somebody who decides to do something really hard that nobody wants but them just because they can't help themselves. And that is what this is. And what is funny in France to French people, you will not be surprised to hear, is not the same as what is funny in English to American people. So to succeed at this, Gad has to understand the exact contours of what is different between the sense of humor of these two entirely different countries while he's on stage. He has to do this live while trying to entertain paying customers.</p><p begin="00:10:37.47" data-timestamp="637.47">Reporter Zack McDermott is the one who first told us about Gad. Zack is a comedy nerd and a former stand-up himself. He takes the story from here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:10:45.55" data-timestamp="645.55">The only reason I know who Gad Elmaleh is is because of my wife. She's Belgian. I'll call her Aurelie because, although we've been married for three years, I still can't pronounce her name right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:10:56.05" data-timestamp="656.05">Aurelie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:10:56.95" data-timestamp="656.95">Once again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:10:57.96" data-timestamp="657.96">Aurelie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:10:58.88" data-timestamp="658.88">Anyway. For her, Gad Elmaleh was a household name growing up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:11:02.94" data-timestamp="662.94">And you know, it's funny because there are a few of his jokes that are so famous that if you say one sentence, everybody knows that you're referring to him. I thought about that. There is something about learning English, and the sentence Brian is in the kitchen--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:11:17.82" data-timestamp="677.82">It's a routine he does about learning English as a kid and the random phrases he had to repeat over and over again, like, where is Brian?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:11:25.16" data-timestamp="685.16">Where is Brian? [FRENCH], Brian is in the kitchen.</p><p begin="00:11:29.94" data-timestamp="689.94">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:11:32.73" data-timestamp="692.73">I mean, I remember my friends, when I was maybe like 15, 16, or maybe a little older-- everybody was saying that. It's like, what is it in English? Like, that's what she said. It's like that. Everybody says that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:11:44.13" data-timestamp="704.13">That's what she said.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:11:44.98" data-timestamp="704.98">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:11:45.82" data-timestamp="705.82">That's my producer, Sean Cole, by the way. You'll be hearing his voice a bit, too, as we go.</p><p begin="00:11:50.29" data-timestamp="710.29">So Aurelie was really excited when Gad moved to New York and started doing shows here. She drug me to a couple of them, including a very early gig last September at a performance space called Joe's Pub. It's not a bar. It's kind of a highbrow New York Cabaret space, and it's cozy. Seats less than 200.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:12:07.40" data-timestamp="727.4">Even just seeing him in such a small venue, it's such a treat. And it's like, wow, how lucky French people are. You're like, that's great.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:15.66" data-timestamp="735.66">I know. It's like seeing like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:12:16.70" data-timestamp="736.7">Sort of like VIP when you do that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:18.07" data-timestamp="738.07">You feel like VIP.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:12:19.01" data-timestamp="739.01">You really do, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:12:20.53" data-timestamp="740.53">It's like seeing Neil Young play at a bar or something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Aurelie</h4><p begin="00:12:22.67" data-timestamp="742.67">I don't know who that is, but sure.</p><p begin="00:12:24.19" data-timestamp="744.19">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:12:25.41" data-timestamp="745.41"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Announcer</h4><p begin="00:12:26.74" data-timestamp="746.74">Joe's Pub is now proud to present Gad Elmaleh.</p><p begin="00:12:31.38" data-timestamp="751.38">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:12:33.48" data-timestamp="753.48">This was, hands down, the best-looking and best-dressed crowd for a comedy show I've ever seen. So many scarves. Such tight jeans. The women looked great, too. The room was mostly French, with some Moroccan fans spackled in, as well. Gad's ethnically Moroccan, and he grew up there, so most of the room knew his French act.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:12:52.14" data-timestamp="772.14">Is he really gonna do this in English? Yeah! Oh, wow. I don't know why I'm doing this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:13:02.95" data-timestamp="782.95">The first thing you notice about Gad is that he's got incredible stage presence. And he's a very physical comedian. One minute he's all elegance and grace, the next he chimps up his face and flops around. His English act is basically observational comedy, including a lot of outsiders' impressions of America and, specifically, New York. For instance, he says he likes to ask directions of Americans because they always include Starbucks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:13:26.99" data-timestamp="806.99">You want to go straight, then there's a Starbucks on your left. You make a right. The next block there's two Starbucks. You make another right. There's another block with another one Starbucks. Make a left at the other block. There's no Starbucks, so don't panic.</p><p begin="00:13:42.71" data-timestamp="822.71">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:13:46.28" data-timestamp="826.28">Asking directions in France is different.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:13:49.01" data-timestamp="829.01">And this bleeds into another staple of his show, which I'll call, Americans be like this, French people be like that. Here's a joke about shopping in New York and this one, over-the-top, earnest sales guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:13:59.95" data-timestamp="839.95">And he told me something you'll never hear in France. Let me double check.</p><p begin="00:14:05.40" data-timestamp="845.4">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:14:08.30" data-timestamp="848.3"></p><p begin="00:14:10.22" data-timestamp="850.22">In France, we don't even have single-check!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:14:14.09" data-timestamp="854.09">You can tell from response in the room that this isn't exactly an away game for Gad. The French and Moroccan folks in the audience love him unconditionally, but even here, in front of the friendliest possible crowd, it's a rough show. There are jokes that just don't go anywhere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:14:29.95" data-timestamp="869.95">A friend of mine, he said, I am a fundamentalist atheist--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:14:33.73" data-timestamp="873.73">A fundamentalist atheist.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:14:35.45" data-timestamp="875.45">I said, what the [BLEEP] is that? It's like if you're ordering a triple-shot espresso, but decaf. I like this one, but I will have to work on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:14:52.03" data-timestamp="892.03">He said this a few times. OK. I have to work on that joke. He had a notepad on his stool, and he'd occasionally jot down which jokes worked and which didn't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:15:01.57" data-timestamp="901.57">OK. Good joke, bad delivery.</p><p begin="00:15:03.75" data-timestamp="903.75">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:15:05.85" data-timestamp="905.85">It's OK. Let's be humble tonight. It's a work in progress. More work than progress, but it's OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:15:13.66" data-timestamp="913.66">He's done other gigs in front of audiences that don't know him where he bombed. It's something that just doesn't happen to him in France these days. Imagine doing something 5,000 times, and on the 5,001st time, you suck. It's not a good feeling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:15:28.21" data-timestamp="928.21">That feeling like if you wear a sweater and you're all wet on your body right after the shower. And you put the-- agh, eugh, algh. You just want to hide. Yeah, I bombed some nights.</p><p begin="00:15:46.53" data-timestamp="946.53">To be honest, I had so many moments where I was, oh my god, how am I gonna do this? I had so many moments writing, crafting last-minute jokes in front of a club, alone, and like, what am I doing?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:16:05.22" data-timestamp="965.22">Good question. Why is he doing this? Onstage, he jokes that he's doing it because he needed to challenge himself, which is only partly a joke. In France, he's reached this weird level of fame where his fans laugh at everything. He told me it doesn't matter what he says anymore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:16:20.93" data-timestamp="980.93">With the people who know me, it's like, oh, heh. They always some, heh. And I don't like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:16:30.10" data-timestamp="990.1">They kind of give you a pass.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:16:31.91" data-timestamp="991.91">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:16:33.02" data-timestamp="993.02">It's not satisfying, he says. It's too easy. But working here-- it's hard again, and that's what he likes about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:16:40.67" data-timestamp="1000.67">I'm excited. I wake up in the morning. I can't wait for the night to perform exactly like it was 20 years ago when I began doing stand-up in France because it was new. Like everything, you know? Like relationship. Like a gum, you know? Gum-- you just put it in your mouth. It's full of sugar. This is now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:04.83" data-timestamp="1024.83">Is that what happened in France? There was no more sugar in your gum?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:17:07.66" data-timestamp="1027.66">No more sugar in my gum. So we need to bring back the sugar in our gum.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:17:18.36" data-timestamp="1038.36">But Gad's friend Dan Naturman believes there's another reason Gad wants to make it in English. Dan's one of the few comics who's gone the other direction. He's an American who sometimes performs in French-- in Paris and Montreal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Naturman</h4><p begin="00:17:29.84" data-timestamp="1049.84">For any French comic-- and I've spent enough time talking to them-- they don't feel like they've conquered comedy until they've conquered America, because this is perceived as the home of stand-up comedy. You ask a French comic, who are your idols, you're more likely to hear Louis CK, Chris Rock. So in that sense, he feels like, OK. I did well in France, but am I really a great comedian if I haven't conquered America? I think he's somewhat insecure in that regard. I think, deep in his heart, he's saying, but I'm not Louis CK. I'm not Seinfeld. I want to be those guys, or as close as I can get. And the only way to do that is to come here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:18:06.11" data-timestamp="1086.11">Can he get there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Naturman</h4><p begin="00:18:07.63" data-timestamp="1087.63">It's gonna be a rough one, isn't it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:18:09.73" data-timestamp="1089.73">We played a recording of that quote for Gad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:18:12.61" data-timestamp="1092.61">It's not easy to hear, but it doesn't hurt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:15.98" data-timestamp="1095.98">Is it true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:18:16.95" data-timestamp="1096.95">Yeah, it's true. Because if you're a great soccer player in America, you want to be with the Real de Madrid. You want to be with Barcelona. You want to be with Bayern de Munich. You want to be with Arsenal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:18:35.00" data-timestamp="1115">Yet someone who wants to connect with an American audience might choose a different analogy, but you get the point. Early on in this whole adventure, Gad made a documentary for French TV about moving to the States. In one scene, the French Jerry Seinfeld is sitting at a restaurant with one of the few people who understands exactly how difficult it will be to make it in America-- the American Jerry Seinfeld. They're friends.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Seinfeld</h4><p begin="00:18:56.76" data-timestamp="1136.76">Let me tell you. Let me explain this to you. The comedian-- the stand-up comedian-- was invented in America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:19:03.09" data-timestamp="1143.09">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Seinfeld</h4><p begin="00:19:03.47" data-timestamp="1143.47">It was invented in America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:19:04.38" data-timestamp="1144.38">So you're surprised that I came to America to do this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Seinfeld</h4><p begin="00:19:07.92" data-timestamp="1147.92">I get what you're doing. It's like, I want to go build a car, but I want to build it in Germany.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:19:14.68" data-timestamp="1154.68">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Seinfeld</h4><p begin="00:19:15.23" data-timestamp="1155.23">And people say, really? In Germany? Then I'm going to go to Italy, and I'm gonna open up a pasta factory. And then I'm going to go to France. I want to make wine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:19:24.18" data-timestamp="1164.18">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Seinfeld</h4><p begin="00:19:24.69" data-timestamp="1164.69">All right? And then I'm going to England, and I'm going to write some plays.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:19:28.50" data-timestamp="1168.5">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jerry Seinfeld</h4><p begin="00:19:30.29" data-timestamp="1170.29">Right?

He's one of the people who brought stand-up comedy to France. Amazingly, it didn't exist there at all until about 15 years ago. Gad says they had no comedy clubs. Before then, he was a kind of entertainer that doesn't really exist here. He did these theatrical one-man shows, playing all sorts of characters, singing songs. But at some point, he became obsessed with the American style of comedy and started addressing his audience directly, telling them jokes just like we do here in the States-- in other words, stand-up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:20:42.53" data-timestamp="1242.53">It was so new. People were like, oh, wow. What is this? He's talking to us. They were not used to it. No pigeon, no rope, no hats, no wigs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:20:55.08" data-timestamp="1255.08">You're not being metaphorical. There were actual pigeons and ropes and wigs in your act before?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:20:59.85" data-timestamp="1259.85">No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:21:00.18" data-timestamp="1260.18">You are being metaphorical?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:21:01.30" data-timestamp="1261.3">Yeah. It is just because this is how American comedians make fun of me sometimes. Like, oh, how is your show in France? Do you do mime and have like a pigeon and magic tricks? Because this is the stereotype. And if I want to talk about the stereotype we have on American comedians, I would say a guy standing up who doesn't move at all with a mic, a little depressed, and say jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:21:31.05" data-timestamp="1291.05">But his French act is still very different from an American stand-up act. In his hour-plus long French specials, he plays piano and guitar and beats on his guitar like a bongo. And there are special guests. It's a boogaloo of a production-- everything but the pigeons. He tells a couple stories about his kid. He's got two-- one with Grace Kelly's granddaughter. He does a lot of observational humor. But he's 10 times more physical in his French act. He's practically performing the scene.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:21:58.43" data-timestamp="1318.43">[SPEAKING FRENCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:22:03.89" data-timestamp="1323.89">He's saying on an airplane, when they hand out little towelettes that smell good, you're like, yeah!

Gad says you can't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:22:28.64" data-timestamp="1348.64">I immediately, very quickly, realized that translating my French jokes into English was not the thing to do-- the good thing to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:22:38.76" data-timestamp="1358.76">Did you try that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:22:39.56" data-timestamp="1359.56">I tried.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:22:40.67" data-timestamp="1360.67">And failed-- kind of spectacularly, in some cases. A lot of the stuff in his French act just doesn't travel well. Only a couple bits survived. He had to drop all the jokes about people freaking out when they meet him because he's so famous.</p><p begin="00:22:54.03" data-timestamp="1374.03">Then there's the stuff he had to drop because of the obvious cultural barriers, or because of the vagaries of either language. For instance, he had this joke. He's mortified talking about it now, but it was about a common expression in French. French people, when someone breaks into their house, they say, je me sens violee. I feel like I've been violated. Except the word "violee" in French also means rape.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:23:15.96" data-timestamp="1395.96">But in French, it's not as shocking as rape. So I didn't know that. So what I said-- I said, you know what guys? We have an expression. When people get burglarized, they say, I felt I was raped. [GASP] And it was like terrible, like ice, like silence. And I was like, oh my god. What did I say? I should not say that.</p><p begin="00:23:43.87" data-timestamp="1423.87"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:23:48.25" data-timestamp="1428.25">Gad's next challenge, he had to recalibrate the pacing of his entire act. Turns out, comedy in France is like everything in France-- laid back, laissez-faire. They kind of ease into jokes the way they take a long time to eat dinner. He actually has a joke about that. Whereas in America--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:24:05.23" data-timestamp="1445.23">The structure of the phrases are shorter and sharper-- sharper? So what I've been doing every day is cutting the fat. I remember, when I first started to do the clubs, I was-- oh my god. I had long setups.</p><p begin="00:24:24.42" data-timestamp="1464.42">OK. So I-- yeah. I was walking, and I said, I'm going to go to that store, so I went to that store. And the guy came up to me and said-- oh, my god. And I was with some friends-- like good friends-- and they said, Gad, stop that. Just go right away. This guy in a store told me this. I thought he was-- boom, boom, bam, bheem. Punchline. That's it. Stop with the whole pigeon thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:24:47.90" data-timestamp="1487.9">The hardest part of this whole endeavor is maybe what you'd guess-- the language. Gad's made a lot of progress since learning how to say Brian is in the kitchen as a kid. But after a few hours of speaking English, even just to us, Gad's exhausted. He says his brain turns to mush, and he just wants to speak French.</p><p begin="00:25:05.81" data-timestamp="1505.81">And a huge part of Gad's quest to become an American comedian is hard core language training. So much of comedy is about timing. If you're off by a beat or a syllable, you murder the joke. The joke is dead. So Gad's working with a language coach several times a week, dissecting his jokes, phrase by phrase, and syllable by syllable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:25:24.00" data-timestamp="1524">Last night I did the American dream thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lenardon</h4><p begin="00:25:26.90" data-timestamp="1526.9">Yep.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:25:27.46" data-timestamp="1527.46">And it was very hard.

It's always-- I'm always confused.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:25:54.16" data-timestamp="1554.16">This joke is about how his father used to take him to the beach, point at the ocean, and tell Gad that, if you sail for days and nights, you will reach America. Gad wondered if any American father was standing on the shore pointing towards Morocco, saying the same thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lenardon</h4><p begin="00:26:07.46" data-timestamp="1567.46">So he did it several times, or he did it once? That's what I need.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:26:10.36" data-timestamp="1570.36">Every time we would go to the beach he would stand in front of the ocean and say this crazy thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lenardon</h4><p begin="00:26:15.11" data-timestamp="1575.11">Then my father would take me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:26:16.99" data-timestamp="1576.99">Yeah.

I like it. It's not a crazy joke, but it's a poetic image. I always wondered if, on the other side of the ocean, there was an American father--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lenardon</h4><p begin="00:26:30.40" data-timestamp="1590.4">Yeah. You see, that's the thing. An American father. That's the thing is you've got your keyword that you have to lift with pitch. And then you have to drop the next word because that's how we hear the contrast. The American father.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:26:41.80" data-timestamp="1601.8">An American father.</p><p begin="00:26:44.09" data-timestamp="1604.09">I'm not sure that on the other side of the ocean there was an American father [INAUDIBLE].</p><p begin="00:26:52.97" data-timestamp="1612.97">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:26:56.91" data-timestamp="1616.91">For a while, Gad had this other joke that just wasn't working till Julia told Gad to say "vay-KAY-shun" instead of "VAY-kay-shun." If that doesn't work, she said, you can fire me. It worked. When you know how hard it is for him, watching him do an hour set in English looks like an Olympic feat. But of course, that's not how these things are scored.</p><p begin="00:27:18.64" data-timestamp="1638.64"></p><p begin="00:27:24.08" data-timestamp="1644.08">Gad's about a year into his new American life. And to be clear, because of his fame elsewhere and his connections, Gad's had about every conceivable unfair advantage a, quote, "fledgling comedian in America" could ask for. That show you heard at Joe's Pub was actually opening night of a six-month residency, three shows a week. No rookie comedian in New York gets that. They knew he could pack the room with French ex-pats. Gad's been on <i>The</i> <i>Daily</i> <i>Show</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Nightly</i> <i>Show</i>, <i>Late</i> <i>Night</i> <i>with</i> <i>Seth</i> <i>Meyers</i>. He did a set on <i>Conan</i>.</p><p begin="00:27:54.10" data-timestamp="1674.1">And he's getting better. His set got tighter during his residency at Joe's Pub. And he might still have the occasional language misstep, but it's happening later in the show. His English is improving. And he just knows his way around the act now. When it works, Gad says, it means more to him than performing for his French fans who've seen his DVDs and know every joke and laugh at everything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:28:15.72" data-timestamp="1695.72">When American audience laugh at my joke, I mean, I feel I'm just, oh, I'm funny. I'm a funny man. I'm not that guy. And even in my everyday life, if I go to a store and I make someone laugh, like at the grocery store, I'm so happy because I'm like, oh, she doesn't know that I'm famous in France, and she just laughed so hard at my joke. I made a joke about, I don't know, cheese or whatever, and I asked her a question and I made this little face, and she was laughing-- really laughing-- and I'm like, oh, I'm a funny man. I'm a funny man.</p><p begin="00:28:58.74" data-timestamp="1738.74">I love to be anonymous. I love-- I love it. And I hope it's not going to stay like this forever.

To answer that, I turned to people who'd know-- some American comedy headliners. I talked to Colin Quinn, Ali Wong, Ron Funches, and Jeff Garlin. All of them watched the same video of a 15-minute set Gad did at the Comedy Cellar back in June. And they all agreed he's a pro. He could totally have a career here. But can he be great? They all said he's not there yet, and they were unanimous on what he needed to do next. There is one specific hole in his act all four pointed to. Here's Colin Quinn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Quinn</h4><p begin="00:29:49.39" data-timestamp="1789.39">Talking about his perceptions of America. All that stuff is great.

Let's [BLEEP] hear about it.</p><p begin="00:30:03.88" data-timestamp="1803.88">The whole point of going to see a comedian is you want to see something that other comedians don't do. What about your country? I'm interested. It's all relatable. It's emotions, you know what I mean? My favorite expression-- now I get to use my favorite expression, which I'm always looking for an excuse. In the specific is the universal.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:30:22.98" data-timestamp="1822.98">What would he have to do to go from this level that he's at right now to being great?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Quinn</h4><p begin="00:30:27.13" data-timestamp="1827.13">He'd have to listen to what I just said.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:30:29.71" data-timestamp="1829.71">Being personal-- that's where American comedy's at right now.

Like, I would love to know why the Jerry Seinfeld of France would want to do stand-up in America all of a sudden?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:31:15.25" data-timestamp="1875.25">Ron Funches agreed with Ali that the most obvious thing for Gad to talk about is one of the topics he thought he had to avoid on stage-- his fame.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ron Funches</h4><p begin="00:31:23.31" data-timestamp="1883.31">This-- what's going on now, his fear of being like, oh, I'm a big deal in France, and now I'm in America, and I'm not that big of a deal. Tell me what that's about. Tell me how that feels. That's probably terrifying and also very brave of you to step out of your comfort zone. Tell me about that.

He really liked Ron's idea for how to talk about his fame.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gad Elmaleh</h4><p begin="00:31:56.21" data-timestamp="1916.21">His point of view is interesting. So maybe I should explain-- just tell them, guys, it's a new life, being famous somewhere and maybe sometimes I'm walking down the street in New York City and I don't get bothered.

I should do that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:32:41.24" data-timestamp="1961.24">But the most pointed criticism was from Jeff Garlin. You might recognize Jeff as Larry David's sidekick/manager on <i>Curb</i> <i>Your</i> <i>Enthusiasm</i>, but he's got 30 years in stand-up. He worked with Jon Stewart and Denis Leary on their stand-up specials, and he's a comic's comic.

But I find him unbelievably charming. I think he's charismatic. He's charming. I could see him becoming very successful here. The audience was under his spell. He has a spell. There's a craft to stand-up comedy as well as an art, and he is a master at the craft. I don't look at him as much of an artist.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zack McDermott</h4><p begin="00:33:24.90" data-timestamp="2004.9">Jeff said to be an artist, he'd have to be more passionate about the stuff he's talking about.

I asked him why, and he said, revolutions don't happen overnight.</p><p begin="00:35:52.10" data-timestamp="2152.1">The comedians I talked to were adamant. For Gad to come up with the kind of material he's going to need to be great in America-- the personal stuff, the stuff he really cares about-- the only way to develop that is to do painful sets on stage where he tries out all kinds of stuff and lets himself bomb. In France, he doesn't do that. And Gad told me it goes against all his instincts-- against 22 years of training-- but he's going to have to override that instinct. He's going to have to embrace bombing, learn to fail at comedy at a whole new level, if he's going to succeed here. It's a concept that's totally foreign to him.</p><p begin="00:36:25.83" data-timestamp="2185.83"></p><p begin="00:36:29.57" data-timestamp="2189.57"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:31.92" data-timestamp="2191.92">Zack McDermott in New York.</p><p begin="00:36:34.74" data-timestamp="2194.74">Gad Elmaleh is about to embark on a European tour, performing in French-- you know, for a change.

But for Ray, she'll cross over, look at the world as a terrier might, the same way you see couples walking down the streets of New York, hand-in-hand, one suffering through something the other one needs, just in order to feel like themselves.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:40.44" data-timestamp="3340.44">Zoe Chace and Emmanuel Dzotsi are producers on our show.</p><p begin="00:55:44.34" data-timestamp="3344.34">[MUSIC - "I SMELL A RAT" BY BIG MAMA THORNTON]</p><p begin="00:56:13.29" data-timestamp="3373.29">[MUSIC - "THE 5TH QUARTER" BY THE MADHATTERS]</p></div> </div>
