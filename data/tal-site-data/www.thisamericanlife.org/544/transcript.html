<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.69" data-timestamp="0.69">So today we have a story that we think might make you believe something that right now you do not believe. And to tell that story, I'm joined here in the studio by NPR science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller. Hey there, guys.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:11.68" data-timestamp="11.68">Hi.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:12.10" data-timestamp="12.1">Hello.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:12.94" data-timestamp="12.94">And do I have this right? So you bought a rat, and you brought it to NPR headquarters in Washington, DC?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:19.20" data-timestamp="19.2">We did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:19.35" data-timestamp="19.35">Alix bought the rat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:20.54" data-timestamp="20.54">I did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:21.54" data-timestamp="21.54">And where at NPR did you bring the rat to?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:24.04" data-timestamp="24.04">We ferreted it into a little kind of edit booth type thing--</p><p begin="00:00:30.63" data-timestamp="30.63">[GIGGLING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:32.13" data-timestamp="32.13">Hi, buddy!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:32.84" data-timestamp="32.84">--type office. And we invited people into the room one by one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:37.80" data-timestamp="37.8">So can you just describe what we got here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:40.00" data-timestamp="40">It's a rat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:40.89" data-timestamp="40.89">Pinkish ears.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 2</h4><p begin="00:00:42.29" data-timestamp="42.29">Red eyes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 3</h4><p begin="00:00:42.90" data-timestamp="42.9">Long nose.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:43.81" data-timestamp="43.81">And sat them down in front of this rat and asked this question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:47.84" data-timestamp="47.84">Do you think that the thoughts that you have in your head-- OK, the private thoughts that you have in your head-- could influence how that rat moves through space?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:58.84" data-timestamp="58.84">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:59.51" data-timestamp="59.51">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 2</h4><p begin="00:00:59.75" data-timestamp="59.75">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 3</h4><p begin="00:01:00.61" data-timestamp="60.61">No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:01.04" data-timestamp="61.04">And it was almost unanimous. People did not believe that their personal thoughts would have any effect on the rat at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 4</h4><p begin="00:01:08.38" data-timestamp="68.38">Because that would suggest some sort of telepathy which I don't have.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:12.57" data-timestamp="72.57">And Ira, maybe that's what you think too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:14.82" data-timestamp="74.82">That is what I think. I don't think that people thinking thoughts will affect a rat's behavior.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:19.71" data-timestamp="79.71">Well, you're wrong.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:22.48" data-timestamp="82.48">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:01:23.66" data-timestamp="83.66">(CHUCKLING) Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:26.02" data-timestamp="86.02">OK, so who's this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:27.34" data-timestamp="87.34">This is a man named Bob Rosenthal. He's a research psychologist. And early in his career, he did this thing. He went into his lab late at night and hung signs on all of the rat cages. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly smart. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly dumb, even though neither of those things was true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:01:51.30" data-timestamp="111.3">They were very average rats that you would buy from a research institute that sells rats for a living.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:58.82" data-timestamp="118.82">So then Bob brings this group of experimenters into his lab, and he says, for the next week, some of you are going to get these incredibly smart rats. And some of you are going to get these incredibly stupid rats. And your job is to run your rat through a maze and record how well it does.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:02:15.71" data-timestamp="135.71">Can you just pick up the rat?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:17.57" data-timestamp="137.57">So, Ira, we actually did a very lo-fi, unscientific version of this in that little room in NPR.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:24.47" data-timestamp="144.47">They let you do that?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:26.36" data-timestamp="146.36">We didn't ask permission.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 4</h4><p begin="00:02:28.10" data-timestamp="148.1">Is that OK to do?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:02:29.48" data-timestamp="149.48">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:29.73" data-timestamp="149.73">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:02:30.42" data-timestamp="150.42">And you've probably already guessed where this is going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:32.78" data-timestamp="152.78">Yeah. In Bob's real study, the experimenters ran the rats that they had been told were smart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:02:37.91" data-timestamp="157.91">She has sort of an intelligent looking face.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:40.24" data-timestamp="160.24">And the rats they had been told were dumb.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 4</h4><p begin="00:02:42.26" data-timestamp="162.26">Yeah, he seems kind of lazy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:44.75" data-timestamp="164.75">It was not even close.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:02:48.24" data-timestamp="168.24">The results were so dramatic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:49.88" data-timestamp="169.88">In Bob's real study, the smart rats did almost twice as well as the dumb rats.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.97" data-timestamp="174.97">Wait, even though they were the same?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:56.76" data-timestamp="176.76">Yeah, even though the smart rats were not smart and the dumb rats were not dumb. They were all just the same average kind of lab rat. It was so shocking, people didn't really believe him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:03:08.83" data-timestamp="188.83">I was having trouble publishing any of this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:11.34" data-timestamp="191.34">And so what was going on? Like, what was actually happening to make the rats do this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:03:15.82" data-timestamp="195.82">So what Bob figured out was that the expectations that the experimenters carried in their heads subtly changed the way that the experimenters touched the rats, and that changed the way that the rats behaved. So when the experimenters thought that the rats were really smart, they felt more warmly towards the rats. And so they touched them more gently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:03:38.53" data-timestamp="218.53">We do know that handling rats and handling them more gently can actually increase the performance of rats.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:53.42" data-timestamp="233.42">And how does this play out when it comes to people? How do our expectations of other people work?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:03:59.37" data-timestamp="239.37">Well, what you saw in the rats totally holds for people too. I talked to Carol Dweck, who's a psychologist and researcher at Stanford.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carol Dweck</h4><p begin="00:04:06.62" data-timestamp="246.62">You may be standing farther away from someone you have lower expectations for. You may not be making as much eye contact. And it's not something you can put your finger on. We are not usually aware of how we are conveying our expectations to other people. But it's there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:04:25.83" data-timestamp="265.83">And it happens in all kinds of areas. Research has shown that a teacher's expectations can raise or lower a student's IQ score, that a mother's expectations influences the drinking behavior of her middle schooler, that military trainers' expectations can literally make a soldier run faster or slower.
