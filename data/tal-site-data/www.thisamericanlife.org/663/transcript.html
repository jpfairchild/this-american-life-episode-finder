Are those your actual names?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peder Jorgensen</h4><p begin="00:00:14.90" data-timestamp="14.9"> Yeah. It's not a joke.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:17.44" data-timestamp="17.44"> Peder Jorgensen and Jesper Sundnes, this is the first time they've ever agreed to do an interview about this thing that they created or even identify themselves as the creator of that thing. This thing they made, they said it all began back in 2015. They were basically hanging out, killing time together, strolling through Facebook, bored. The location for this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesper Sundnes</h4><p begin="00:00:36.66" data-timestamp="36.66"> At work, supposed to be working.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.85" data-timestamp="39.85"> Because you had a lot of free time at that job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peder Jorgensen</h4><p begin="00:00:42.04" data-timestamp="42.04"> No, no, we were working all the time, working really hard. It's probably during a lunch break.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:46.36" data-timestamp="46.36"> I like that one of you said yes and one of you said no.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:00:49.93" data-timestamp="49.93"> They were working in radio. They live in Oslo, Norway. Anyway, they noticed on their friends Facebook feeds, very common--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesper Sundnes</h4><p begin="00:00:56.74" data-timestamp="56.74"> People were posting lots of, like, inspirational images with inspirational words. And it kind of looked like there was a system behind the whole thing. It kind of felt like a machine should be able to do this. Yeah, a robot could probably make that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:12.97" data-timestamp="72.97"> Could make an inspirational quote. After all, they're so formulaic-- every day might not be a good day, but there's good in every day. You fell down yesterday. Stand up today. The secret to getting ahead is getting started.</p><p begin="00:01:28.66" data-timestamp="88.66">So Jesper and Peder set out to program a computer to create these to generate inspirational sentences and paste them onto stock photos of beaches, and starry nights, and people staring into the distance. And what's interesting is just how quickly the program kind of took on a mind of its own.</p><p begin="00:01:46.18" data-timestamp="106.18">At first, they said the computer really did generate very typical, kind of predictable inspirational quotes. They said that wasn't terribly difficult. But as they gave it a bigger vocabulary and taught it to string together a wider variety of sentences, the kinds of sayings that it started to crank out started to evolve.</p><p begin="00:02:02.99" data-timestamp="122.99">As they got more random, they got funnier and darker and-- I don't want to oversell this, but it's true-- actually, sometimes kind of profound. The bot started to take on a personality, the personality that it actually has now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesper Sundnes</h4><p begin="00:02:17.50" data-timestamp="137.5"> Yeah, I can remember very well the moment we were looking at the quotes, and it wasn't what we had imagined. It felt like something that we hadn't created really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:34.08" data-timestamp="154.08"> I've saved some of these on my laptop. Here's one. OK, so each one is a quote on top of some peaceful, contemplative image. This one, first one, the picture is a nighttime sky. And-- I don't know-- maybe that's the Aurora Borealis. And the words say, love is an animal eating your brain.</p><p begin="00:02:57.46" data-timestamp="177.46">This one here is a close-up of a coin. It says, never think of it as a job. Think of it as health insurance, which, you know, people definitely feel, some people about their jobs. I love this one.</p><p begin="00:03:11.13" data-timestamp="191.13">OK, so this is a picture of Big Ben. It says, when you're eating dinner, don't forget that everything and everyone will someday be gone forever. A bunch of them have this kind of cold-water-in-the-face, wake-up-to-reality, slap-you-across-the-cheeks quality to them.</p><p begin="00:03:26.73" data-timestamp="206.73">There's one that says-- there's a photo of a man. This is a manager, starry sky, it says, your time on Earth is random. A woman offers a lit sparkler. It says simply, you're average. A man stands on a shore, it says, don't explore your true self. It's not worth it. But most of them are not like that.</p><p begin="00:03:48.37" data-timestamp="228.37">Here's a picture of a spiral galaxy. It says, all you need in order to travel to Mars is a boy and a flag, which, in a certain way, is actually kind of true. These are all made by a machine. They're made by a bot.</p><p begin="00:04:05.25" data-timestamp="245.25">And a certain number of them do seem like gibberish. An education can be like an angry child. What does that mean? Or be fine, systematized, spouse finity-- it's like, OK.</p><p begin="00:04:21.72" data-timestamp="261.72">But a surprising number of these, they not only makes sense, they seem to have something on their mind. They have something to say. Celebrity is basically just another term for pretentious burglar.</p><p begin="00:04:33.00" data-timestamp="273">Life on Earth is just one long commercial for sperm. Urinating on an electric fence could be the mistake of a lifetime, which that's true. Normies unite. Cooperate and fight your common adversary-- mass hysteria.</p><p begin="00:04:47.82" data-timestamp="287.82"></p><p begin="00:04:49.57" data-timestamp="289.57"></p><p begin="00:04:55.45" data-timestamp="295.45">I reached out to Jesper and Peder, because I was wondering, how does this really work? How do you get a machine that does not understand what words mean, does not understand what it's saying at all, how do you get it to turn out sayings that mean something to us?</p><p begin="00:05:09.89" data-timestamp="309.89">And neither of these guys had been a professional programmer or studied it in school. Peder had taught himself to code years before. And he made this with just kind of a grab bag of standard programming tools. He explained the recipe for an inspirational quote like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peder Jorgensen</h4><p begin="00:05:23.07" data-timestamp="323.07"> So right now, we're in the studio in Oslo. And the sun is shining outside, but the drapes are pulled down. So if I say something like, you have to pull the drapes up to see the sun, it kind of makes sense in a practical way.</p><p begin="00:05:37.79" data-timestamp="337.79">However, as soon as you put something like that on a beautiful backdrop, it starts speaking to you on a different level. You have to pull up the drapes to see the sun. It sounds like the cure for depression when it's put in the right picture. But it's just a very practical, normal thing to say really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:54.47" data-timestamp="354.47"> Another thing they noticed in lots of inspirational sayings, they were juxtapositions-- opposites glued into the same sentence.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesper Sundnes</h4><p begin="00:06:02.06" data-timestamp="362.06"> Things put up against each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peder Jorgensen</h4><p begin="00:06:03.81" data-timestamp="363.81"> Yeah, so there are no limits to what you can accomplish, except the limits you place on your own thinking. So that's just--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesper Sundnes</h4><p begin="00:06:11.09" data-timestamp="371.09"> Limits is the keyword.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peder Jorgensen</h4><p begin="00:06:12.90" data-timestamp="372.9"> Yeah, and then you just take the words and then turn them around after a comma. So it's, like, the two-part sentences. They can be pretty obvious, but still, it feels inspirational when you put it on a nice picture.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:22.70" data-timestamp="382.7"> To make the bot able to do this, the way to do it, really, they said, is just imitation. The algorithm imitates the sentence structure and the kinds of words that appear in real inspirational quotes on the internet. They fed it thousands of inspirational quotes. At first, of course, it was a little buggy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peder Jorgensen</h4><p begin="00:06:38.72" data-timestamp="398.72"> The grammar, the syntax was a total mess.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:42.77" data-timestamp="402.77"> Here's an early failed example.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesper Sundnes</h4><p begin="00:06:44.96" data-timestamp="404.96"> I can read one here. It's don't be jealous of spilled wife.

<h3>Act One: The Veritas Is Out There</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:45.82" data-timestamp="645.82"> Act 1, the veritas is out there.</p><p begin="00:10:49.56" data-timestamp="649.56">So I just found this out that since the 1990s, if you got into college, and you decided to attend the college, at lots of schools, you can work at your own admissions file. See what the admissions people said about you when you were applying. In fancy schools that are hard to get into, you can try to figure out why they decided to admit you in the first place, which lots of kids do.</p><p begin="00:11:08.95" data-timestamp="668.95">But the downside is, you might find something you didn't want to see, and then you have to deal with that. Diane Wu does the story of one Harvard student that happened to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:11:18.84" data-timestamp="678.84"> At Harvard, going to see your admissions file has suddenly got caught up into something much bigger. As you might have heard, Harvard's being sued for allegedly discriminating against Asians. Asian applicants with high GPAs and test scores have a lower acceptance rate than other students with the same numbers.</p><p begin="00:11:35.79" data-timestamp="695.79">Harvard does consider a student's race when they apply as one of many factors. The group that's suing them wants them to stop doing that altogether. It's a group called Students For Fair Admissions. They're trying to get rid of affirmative action all across the country. And this case is likely to be appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p><p begin="00:11:54.53" data-timestamp="714.53">Alex Zhang is a junior, co-president of the Chinese Students Association. I met him the first week of the trial. He's solidly team Harvard in the lawsuit, because Harvard is on the side of keeping affirmative action.</p><p begin="00:12:06.44" data-timestamp="726.44">For him, it was a moral decision. Of course, diversity is good, and getting rid of affirmative action is bad. So he wrote a statement for an amicus brief, and got his student group to sign on to another one.</p><p begin="00:12:17.78" data-timestamp="737.78">Friends of his were looking at their admissions files. So Alex decided to go as well, partly because he was curious how his file stacked up against the claims made in the lawsuit. But also, he just wanted to see how he got in. He'd always wanted to find out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:12:31.43" data-timestamp="751.43"> I'm really curious about the interview component, because I just feel like that's what did it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:12:35.51" data-timestamp="755.51"> Did you have a really good interview?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:12:37.06" data-timestamp="757.06"> Yeah, a really good interview with a really old and experienced alumni.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:12:44.03" data-timestamp="764.03"> The way this usually works-- you meet with an alumni volunteer for an hour or so in a coffee shop or wherever in your hometown. Alex is from Portland, Oregon. He had an exceptional interview. It lasted two hours. Then even more unusual, his interviewer set up a second meeting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:13:00.17" data-timestamp="780.17"> He did this whole thing, where he ran through all my extracurriculars, kind of tallied up hours and stuff, just was very rigorous, even asked for some contacts for references, which, apparently, he wasn't supposed to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:13:14.48" data-timestamp="794.48"> He was really--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:13:15.92" data-timestamp="795.92"> He did that because he wanted to have everything on the table for him to advocate for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:13:22.13" data-timestamp="802.13"> Alex wanted to know, did this guy get me in? The alumni interview is important at Harvard, because usually, it's the only face-to-face contact the school has with an applicant. And admissions officers use it, plus other information, to assign applicants this thing called a personal rating.</p><p begin="00:13:37.97" data-timestamp="817.97">The personal rating is actually the crux of the lawsuit. It's basically a rating of your personality. The words Harvard uses to describe what they're looking for are things like leadership, courage, sense of humor, effervescence. It's like they want to fill the school with future senators, perky Griffindors, and Reese Witherspoon in <i>Legally</i> <i>Blonde</i> types.</p><p begin="00:13:57.35" data-timestamp="837.35">Students for Fair Admissions says the personal rating is where the discrimination happens, where implicit bias leaks in. Because at Harvard, Asian applicants get a lower personal rating than white applicants. Harvard does not dispute those numbers, but says they don't consider an applicant's race when assigning the personal rating.</p><p begin="00:14:22.03" data-timestamp="862.03">A couple days after I met him, Alex called me from a study lounge. He'd just gone to see his file, sat with 15 other kids around a table at the registrar's office and paged through it. He wasn't allowed to take the file with him, but could take pictures on his phone. He scrolled through the photos and read parts of it to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:14:38.98" data-timestamp="878.98"> Let me take a quick look. The first sheet is the Harvard scores, so they have this weird coding jargon that I don't really understand yet. I'll probably look it up later.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:14:56.20" data-timestamp="896.2"> We got quickly to the part he was curious about-- the report from his alumni interviewer, which was the most remarkable part of his file. For starters, it was long.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:15:06.10" data-timestamp="906.1"> My interviewer wrote, like, five pages of notes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:10.86" data-timestamp="910.86"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:15:11.56" data-timestamp="911.56"> Which I think is kind of unusual.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:14.71" data-timestamp="914.71"> It is. Everyone else I checked with had only two pages. Reading through, Alex saw that his interviewer, Jim McCandlish was really going to bat for him. He told Alex that he was one of the best candidates he'd met in more than 20 years of interviewing. Though Alex learned, a lot of Jim's thoroughness-- the extra interview, the references he called-- that was Jim checking into whether or not Alex was for real.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:15:38.50" data-timestamp="938.5"> It seems like he was skeptical of a lot of stuff I did, at least was concerned about this resume-builder mentality and wanted to verify whether I did that authentic work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:15:52.06" data-timestamp="952.06"> Like when Alex said he worked on homelessness at the youth commission, Jim wondered, is he just saying that because he googled my law firm and read that I represent disadvantaged people? Quote, "was this a perfect for MIT mechanical engineer playing me?" Perfect for MIT, I guess, is code for too boring for Harvard.</p><p begin="00:16:11.92" data-timestamp="971.92">Jim called up Alex's supervisor at the youth commission and found out, no, Alex genuinely cared about homelessness and works there even more than he'd let on. Alex read Jim's interview notes to me matter-of-factly, then paused to note this one section.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:16:27.87" data-timestamp="987.87"> Oh, here's an interesting portion actually.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:16:30.64" data-timestamp="990.64"> Jim was writing about a conversation he'd had with that supervisor. Apparently, he had asked not just about Alex, but about Alex's mom, too. He writes--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:16:40.03" data-timestamp="1000.03"> She is far from the stereotypical, quote, "tiger mother." His mom is supportive, but not directive. So I guess there's just those two, three sentences on my mom.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:16:52.19" data-timestamp="1012.19"> How do you feel about that? How would you feel about that characterization of your mom?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:16:58.92" data-timestamp="1018.92"> I mean, it's true. Yeah, she's supported, but not directive. She pushes me. She pushes me hard, but has always sort of let me push in the direction I wanted.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:17:12.35" data-timestamp="1032.35"> Is it weird to you at all that the interviewer is pointing to stereotypes that you aren't? Is he a perfect-for-MIT engineer playing me, or does he have a tiger mom?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:17:27.37" data-timestamp="1047.37"> Oh, yeah. That's a good point.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:17:32.62" data-timestamp="1052.62"> As soon as I asked the question, I felt like I overstepped, like I was planting the idea in Alex's head that something racial was going on. But when I heard tiger mother, I thought, there is the implicit bias they're talking about in the lawsuit in a way more explicit form than I was expecting.</p><p begin="00:17:49.18" data-timestamp="1069.18">Alex did have a strange feeling about it, even if he wasn't sure exactly why.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:17:54.13" data-timestamp="1074.13"> Yeah, that is really weird. I guess it kind of goes into a narrative like the Asian applicant has to disprove certain things to be considered viable for something ivy league.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:18:08.22" data-timestamp="1088.22"> In other words, if you want to get into Harvard, don't be too Asian.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:18:12.06" data-timestamp="1092.06"> Hmm. That makes sense. I don't know what his motivations are, my interviewer's motivations. Maybe the interviewer was like, oh, I should distinguish him from other Asians, or maybe he just does it subconsciously.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:18:28.42" data-timestamp="1108.42"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:18:30.11" data-timestamp="1110.11"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:18:33.06" data-timestamp="1113.06"> There's another thing like this in Jim's notes, another spot where he points to an Asian stereotype and says it doesn't fit Alex. It has to do with the fact that Alex is quiet, which is a stereotype about Asian students. One, actually, that Harvard was called out for using in a 1990 federal investigation.</p><p begin="00:18:50.76" data-timestamp="1130.76">But in Alex's case, Jim casts it as a plus. He writes, "Alex is reserved, quietly confident, uses language frugally but effectively. There is no teenage patois." Perfect-for-MIT engineer, by the way, also plays into a stereotype of Asians only being interested in science and math. This one didn't bother Alex, though, since he literally wanted to be an engineer when he was applying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:19:16.65" data-timestamp="1156.65"> The tiger mother part is definitely interesting. No other mom is called a tiger mom. That's what you call a Chinese mom. Only Chinese moms are called tiger moms. It definitely seems like he's trying to disprove what a reviewer might assume about the reasoning for why I do things.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:19:33.54" data-timestamp="1173.54"> Yeah. How do you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:19:37.63" data-timestamp="1177.63"> I don't know. So he actually has a Chinese wife.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:19:44.50" data-timestamp="1184.5"> Is he Chinese? He's not Chinese.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:19:47.44" data-timestamp="1187.44"> No, he's an old white guy, very American, grew up very American, went to Harvard during the time when it was, like, four white people played baseball on the baseball team. Everything's with good intentions. But I think he might just be a little more old-fashioned.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:20:07.99" data-timestamp="1207.99"> Alex actually knows Jim pretty well. They kept in touch after his interview. Their families became friends. Alex's mom helped teach Jim's wife how to drive. He gets dinner with Jim whenever he's back home.</p><p begin="00:20:20.19" data-timestamp="1220.19">Alex left our conversation feeling pretty fine about what he'd read. But then he stepped back into a campus caught in the force field of the lawsuit, where anything to do with race, and bias, and admissions felt hypercharged.</p><p begin="00:20:32.37" data-timestamp="1232.37">One of the biggest ways the lawsuit has shaken up Harvard is that certain statistics are now public, like the school said that without affirmative action, one out of two black kids wouldn't get it. Latino kids-- they'd lose one out of three. Kids whose parents went to Harvard, who are, by the way, mostly white have a seven times better chance of getting in than regular kids.</p><p begin="00:20:54.84" data-timestamp="1254.84">It's making students ask questions they'd rather not about how they got in. It's uncomfortable. I talked to two black students who chose not to see their files this fall. Both were worried it would say, let's take her because she's black. They didn't think it would, but still. One of them had the request form open on her computer for more than a week before she decided, nah, maybe senior year.</p><p begin="00:21:18.81" data-timestamp="1278.81">For Asian students, the question is the opposite. It's not am I here because of my race, but am I here in spite of it? It's cranked people's race goggles up to level 10. One of Alex's friends wrote on Facebook about a comment in her file. "She's a bright student, but what distinguishes her from other bright students?"</p><p begin="00:21:37.74" data-timestamp="1297.74">To her, this was racially coded. When she read it she saw, she seemed smart, but is there anything that makes her different from other Asian students? Well, if that was racially coded, Alex thought, you should see mine. He texted some close friends from his freshman year Chinese class.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:21:53.76" data-timestamp="1313.76"> I sent a couple screen grabs from my admissions file to them. I was like, hey, I can't get this off my mind. I didn't react that strongly to it until after I saw this stuff online. And now, I'm starting to feel pretty troubled by it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:22:10.41" data-timestamp="1330.41"> What was the part that was troubling to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:22:13.26" data-timestamp="1333.26"> My main trouble was, oh, does he feel like he needs to prove that I'm not like other Asians to the admissions office? And is that what it takes to get in nowadays? Most other college interviewers, I just talked for, like, an hour, an hour and a half. But Jim was doing a background check, you know? Why did he feel the need to do so rigorous of a background check?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:22:36.18" data-timestamp="1356.18"> Alex's friends saw his screen grab saying tiger mom and perfect-for-MIT engineer and texted him back, oh, my god and that's kind of horrible. Tiger mom was actually a lot more explicit than any of the examples of bias that came up at the trial. It was really a fight over statistics and economic models, but a few stereotypes did come up. They were subtle. Things like Harvard referring to Asian applicants as one-dimensional or book smart.</p><p begin="00:23:09.72" data-timestamp="1389.72">Alex wanted to see what Jim was actually thinking when he wrote tiger mother. See if it really was a racial thing, like his friends were saying. So he gave him a call. Alex taped the call and with Jim's permission, sent it to me.</p><p begin="00:23:22.94" data-timestamp="1402.94">First, they catch up a little bit. Alex tells Jim about how he went to go see his file. He mentions an op-ed he co-wrote for the student newspaper.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:23:30.75" data-timestamp="1410.75"> Did you read the op-ed I wrote, by any chance? I don't think I sent it to you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Mccandlish</h4><p begin="00:23:34.20" data-timestamp="1414.2"> Yes, you did send it. I read it, and I totally regret that I did not respond. It was very well done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:23:49.16" data-timestamp="1429.16"> It was very well done, Jim says.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:23:51.71" data-timestamp="1431.71"> Oh, really? You thought so?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Mccandlish</h4><p begin="00:23:53.89" data-timestamp="1433.89"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:23:54.88" data-timestamp="1434.88"> I'm glad you thought so.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:23:57.68" data-timestamp="1437.68"> They talk about the lawsuit. And before Alex can even bring up tiger moms, Jim volunteers his own ideas about implicit bias in admissions. He's been thinking about the effect of the interviewer's biases because--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jim Mccandlish</h4><p begin="00:24:09.56" data-timestamp="1449.56"> Most likely, at least certainly from a place like Oregon, the interviewer is Caucasian. And we know there are stereotypes. I'm just curious how that plays out. If you have an expectation that an Asian interviewee is going to have a drab personality or meek and mild, you may play into your stereotype and not develop the rapport that would defeat the stereotype or at least resist it.

He told me, yeah, part of what he was doing was overtly pointing out to the admissions officers that Alex was different from other Chinese-American applicants. That this young man did not fit whatever stereotypes that he or the admissions officers might have. And his no-holds-barred strategy to get Alex in, it seemed to work.</p><p begin="00:28:48.37" data-timestamp="1728.37">The first reviewer, who went through Alex's file before his interview, wrote, "hope the alumni interview can add."

But he had no hard feelings.</p><p begin="00:30:29.44" data-timestamp="1829.44">Though when Alex thought more about tiger mother, he realized, it was not just the use of the term that unsettled him, but also, the assumption that it was a bad thing in the first place. Something that Harvard would want to make sure none of its students had.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:30:42.79" data-timestamp="1842.79"> This idea that a tiger mom would even be-- I know it is a thing in our culture for a lot of parents, but also is weird that there's a fixation on that by American society. Also, the question is, why does it matter if your parents pushed you in that way? Is that not part of your upbringing and who you are now?</p><p begin="00:31:07.12" data-timestamp="1867.12">I don't know.

Just one white student had.</p><p begin="00:32:17.33" data-timestamp="1937.33">Alex is from a mostly white neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. Growing up, his classmates often couldn't see past his race. They teased him for having a flat face, about being a nerd. One girl exclusively called him Asian instead of Alex.</p><p begin="00:32:31.49" data-timestamp="1951.49">In middle school, he started playing basketball, partly to downplay his Chinese-ness, fit in with the white kids. Out on the court, though, someone would still always call him Yao Ming. But he didn't write about any of that in his personal essay.</p><p begin="00:32:45.42" data-timestamp="1965.42">Instead, it's about how he transforms from a lonely elementary school kid playing video games by himself to big man on campus at his high school.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:32:54.05" data-timestamp="1974.05"> You didn't talk about race in your essay.

In high school, I had a lot of internalized hatred about being Asian. I had this whole perception that I needed to differentiate myself. So I think one of my views is that, oh, we aren't seen. This also goes to myself being really cautious of the system or potential biases.</p><p begin="00:33:28.05" data-timestamp="2008.05">So I was like, oh, I probably need to show that I have been more social, or I have been a leader, have done these cool things.</p><p begin="00:33:38.70" data-timestamp="2018.7"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:33:39.36" data-timestamp="2019.36"> It struck me that it might be that while you were preparing your application, you were making some similar-ish calculation to maybe what Jim was making.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:33:49.80" data-timestamp="2029.8"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:33:53.33" data-timestamp="2033.33"> Not I want to differentiate myself from all other applicants, but I extra want to differentiate myself from other Asian applicants.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Zhang</h4><p begin="00:34:04.18" data-timestamp="2044.18"> Probably.

I don't like that I [INAUDIBLE] that way if it was because of that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:34:20.81" data-timestamp="2060.81"> I asked Alex if what he saw in his file shifted his position at all in the lawsuit. No, he said. To him, tiger mom was weird for sure, but it wasn't discrimination. It didn't sway the argument one way or another.

<h3>Act Two: Know That You Are Unprecedentedly Negative</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:54.83" data-timestamp="2154.83"> Act Two-- I'm just going to see if the InspiroBot can come up with a good title for this act. Hold on.</p><p begin="00:35:59.27" data-timestamp="2159.27">Pushing the button, and the thing is flashing. And there's a picture of a tree and a night sky. It says, know that you are unprecedentedly negative, which, I have to say, that's actually a shockingly decent title for the act that we're about to do. We were going to call it side effects may include bankruptcy or whatever the thing came up with. And then the bot actually did a really good job.</p><p begin="00:36:21.50" data-timestamp="2181.5"></p><p begin="00:36:21.89" data-timestamp="2181.89">Act 2, Know That You Are Unprecedentedly Negative. One of our producers, David Kestenbaum, recently came across this kind of amazing collection of documents on a government website. These documents-- letters and emails, like thousands of them-- they're part of the usual machinery of bureaucratic decision-making. But David saw something more in them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:36:41.00" data-timestamp="2201"> I found these letters about four clicks deep on a website for the Department of Financial Services for the state of New York. I was digging around, looking for some numbers on a different story, and there they were-- page after page of detailed, handwritten letters and emails going on, at length and with great passion and precision, about their health insurance plans.</p><p begin="00:37:00.94" data-timestamp="2220.94">They'd been buying them through the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And every year, their plans were getting more expensive and not just by a little. I printed these letters out. They filled two binders, and I read them all.</p><p begin="00:37:13.48" data-timestamp="2233.48">There's something about the intimacy of these letters that makes them hard to stop reading. You can feel people sitting down to write them in their homes, coming face to face with the cost of their insurance, and just searching for the right words. Some are desperate. Some are exhausted. Some people are funny.</p><p begin="00:37:28.89" data-timestamp="2248.89">It's this record of our fellow citizens shouting into the abyss. And they got to me in this way that news stories about this never have. These are people reacting to a situation that would drive anyone crazy.</p><p begin="00:37:41.59" data-timestamp="2261.59">The first year, 2015, the cost of their plans increased 6% on average. Next year, they went up again by 7%. Then the next year, up again by 17%. Then the next year, another 15%.</p><p begin="00:37:56.38" data-timestamp="2276.38">That's a 50% increase over just four years. So if you were paying $12,000 a year at the start for your family, the price might have gone up to $18,000. And the reason these people were writing this year is that it looked like prices were going to go up again.</p><p begin="00:38:11.11" data-timestamp="2291.11">Insurance companies wanted to raise prices another 24%. So for a family that started at $12,000, that would bring you to $22,000 a year for insurance. People were not pleased.</p><p begin="00:38:23.17" data-timestamp="2303.17">The approaches varied. There were the, I'm a serious person, this is a serious letter about a serious matter ones. Dear sir, or sometimes, dear sir or madam, or to whom it may concern, they begin. And then something like this one-- a premium rate hike is unconscionable. I'm appalled that such a significant premium increase is being sought after my first year of coverage. There is clearly no consumer protection for the public. I object strenuously to this requested rate increase for mediocre coverage. So formal.</p><p begin="00:38:50.56" data-timestamp="2330.56">Another letter ended, I will pray for an acceptable solution of this horrible situation and that good sense, goodwill, and fairness prevail. But honestly, those are the minority. This one's more typical. Are you freaking kidding me about letting them raise the rate $88.29 per month? That was in all caps.</p><p begin="00:39:10.07" data-timestamp="2350.07">And then there's this one. If this happens, I will drop this plan and company faster than Snoop Dogg drops it like it's hot. That was basically the whole email. Another started, ha, ha, ha, this is a joke, which was a common thought. Is this a joke? I don't think any additional comments are needed. That person then went on to give quite a number of comments.</p><p begin="00:39:30.67" data-timestamp="2370.67">The reason all these people took the time to write to their state government about this is that in New York, like in a lot of states, actually, when a health insurance company wants to charge people more money, it can't just do it. For policies that are sold directly to individuals, as these were on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, the insurance company has to get approval from government regulators to raise its prices.</p><p begin="00:39:51.28" data-timestamp="2391.28">And in New York, health insurance companies have to be really clear they are proposing raising their rates. They have to send out a letter to everyone who has their insurance saying they want to raise their prices, exactly how much. And toward the end of the letter, they have to stick in this paragraph. It feels kind of perfunctory.</p><p begin="00:40:06.75" data-timestamp="2406.75">It mentions there is a 30-day public comment period. It gives an address and a website. So if people have any comments or questions, they can write to the state of New York, which they do. This year, New York got 754 letters in 30 days.</p><p begin="00:40:22.27" data-timestamp="2422.27">Most states, as far as I can tell, do not go out of their way to make these letters public, but New York does. Someone there carefully scans them all, organizes them, and puts them online. I went through the letters from years past. The government has blacked out people's names to protect their privacy. But sometimes, you get this little window into someone's life.</p><p begin="00:40:41.32" data-timestamp="2441.32">One person is a Pilates teacher in Long Island. Another said her husband had died. Another was contemplating a knee replacement and was in pain. One wrote that the family had just gotten back from vacation. You can kind of imagine the person finding the notice of rate increase in the mail, then sitting down in total anger to write, maybe not even taking their coat off.</p><p begin="00:41:00.34" data-timestamp="2460.34">And you can feel people struggling with the fact that a bunch of keyboard keys do not seem adequate to express their emotions. They'll throw an extra exclamation point in, or two, or 46. Yes, 46. I imagine the person sticking their finger on the key and just leaving it there for a while, thinking, there, that's about right.</p><p begin="00:41:20.40" data-timestamp="2480.4">And reading these letters, which took a day, I realized, it is not just names that are getting blacked out, other things too. Where the blank do you people get off raising health insurance almost $200 a month? You have to be blank kidding me, you blank. But you know that already.</p><p begin="00:41:36.79" data-timestamp="2496.79">Which made me wonder about this other letter that was entirely blacked out. People were so angry. It was like reading Yelp reviews for a bad restaurant, but where the meal cost $20,000 and in some cases, you don't even get to eat it, which of course, is the nature of insurance, but still.</p><p begin="00:41:55.69" data-timestamp="2515.69">I don't like writing these letters, as I feel like a ranting old man, one guy wrote. But between watching premiums rise out of control and seeing the insurance I have not cover actual costs, I am that ranting fool. His insurance company wanted to raise rates by 40%.</p><p begin="00:42:19.40" data-timestamp="2539.4">One question a lot of people had, why were prices going up so much? I don't get a raise, one person wrote. Why should they?</p><p begin="00:42:27.29" data-timestamp="2547.29">Nobody got back to these people with an explanation. So if any of you letter writers are listening, here's what happened. When the Obamacare exchanges launched in 2013, the premiums for that first year were a lot lower. And after a rough start, things seem to be working. People who couldn't afford health care suddenly could. And in some places, there were lots of options to choose from.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man In Ad</h4><p begin="00:42:49.74" data-timestamp="2569.74"> Let's say a grizzly bear escaped from the zoo.

I dug into some of the older letters to see what the reaction was back then. Stop counting my money. Stop trying to figure out how much more I should owe your company. And stop writing stupid cutesy blurbs about bears hugging you and crushing your ribs. Adults are reading this, not 12 year olds. Do not raise my premium. Not to pick on Oscar, but I think, as a new insurance company, people hope things might be different.</p><p begin="00:44:12.63" data-timestamp="2652.63">In the years since 2013, insurance companies in New York and around the country raised their prices on the Obamacare exchanges.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Trump</h4><p begin="00:44:19.97" data-timestamp="2659.97"> You know, I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:44:24.99" data-timestamp="2664.99"> That, of course, is President Trump with his diagnosis of what was going on, or maybe it was a prescription for what he wanted to happen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Trump</h4><p begin="00:44:32.22" data-timestamp="2672.22"> Let Obamacare implode.</p><p begin="00:44:33.58" data-timestamp="2673.58">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:44:36.72" data-timestamp="2676.72"> But according to economists who study these things and, frankly, the insurance companies themselves, the exchanges were not imploding. What was going on was that the insurance companies had set premiums too low at the beginning, some combination of wanting to attract customers and genuinely not knowing how sick or healthy the people who signed up were going to be.</p><p begin="00:44:55.24" data-timestamp="2695.24">So the prices had been going up to correct for that. But contrary to Trump's claim, the exchanges seemed unlikely to implode, unless of course, someone did something to make that happen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donald Trump</h4><p begin="00:45:05.98" data-timestamp="2705.98"> The individual mandate is being repealed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:45:10.47" data-timestamp="2710.47"> Here is that someone, which of course, is the same someone as before-- President Trump.

They ran the numbers and predicted that a bunch of healthy people would drop it like it's hot, go without insurance, meaning the remaining pool of people would be sicker. And so premiums would have to rise again. That is what was driving a lot of the requested price increase this year and all those letters begging the state of New York to somehow stop it.</p><p begin="00:46:22.89" data-timestamp="2782.89">This one letter stood out to me, in part, because the person wasn't demanding anything, just explaining. It was from a woman whose husband had died. So she was getting a little money from Social Security, but still having to work.</p><p begin="00:46:35.55" data-timestamp="2795.55">Quote, "I do not live above my means. I can't. The expenses of living leave me little to spend on luxury items, such as eating out, going to a movie, or taking a vacation. It seems this year, everything has gone up. Car insurance-- I drive a 14-year-old car that is starting to need more costly repairs, groceries, cable, electric, rent. When this insurance was first introduced, it was called affordable for whom?</p><p begin="00:47:04.15" data-timestamp="2824.15">I have worked since I was 16, minus a few years I was home raising children. I have faithfully paid my taxes every year. At this point in time, I am at a loss on what to do. I am so discouraged. There's not much more I can give up just to afford to live. Can you suggest any options? Thanks for your time." I wondered if anyone read these letters and if they made a difference.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:47:38.82" data-timestamp="2858.82"> You get a lot of mail.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:47:40.83" data-timestamp="2860.83"> I get a lot of mail?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:47:42.80" data-timestamp="2862.8"> Of public comments.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:47:44.43" data-timestamp="2864.43"> Oh, I get a lot of mail that I never even see. There's lots of mail that's addressed to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:47:49.62" data-timestamp="2869.62"> This is Maria Vullo, the superintendent of the Department of Financial Services for the state of New York. And yes, when I requested the interview, I'd said I wanted to talk about the letters. But I get that reading all these letters and the others she receives-- probably not the best use of her time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:04.95" data-timestamp="2884.95"> Do you want to see what these look like printed out? Here. These are all of them. That's one book.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:48:14.12" data-timestamp="2894.12"> OK, sure. We receive comments from the public on a whole number of issues, and we believe in the receipt of public comments. And my staff reviews them all.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:25.62" data-timestamp="2905.62"> So I ask this without judgment. I'm literally just curious. Do you ever read these?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:48:30.21" data-timestamp="2910.21"> Some I do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:31.50" data-timestamp="2911.5"> So I read through all these. I found them really interesting. Some of them are funny. Some of them are sad. A lot of them are just really angry. People took the time to write in by hand.</p><p begin="00:48:49.20" data-timestamp="2929.2">I received this letter and have been so upset since. This thing goes on for pages. There's-- what if it was your mother? Help, cannot pay what I have now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Loconte</h4><p begin="00:49:01.50" data-timestamp="2941.5"> I will say that this year,</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:49:03.42" data-timestamp="2943.42"> The person jumping in here is Richard Loconte. He was in the room for the interview. He heads the communications department.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Loconte</h4><p begin="00:49:09.03" data-timestamp="2949.03"> That this year in particular, the tone definitely was angrier. That I knew. I would hear from Ron on my team on an almost daily basis saying, you have to see these letters. People are angry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:49:22.28" data-timestamp="2962.28"> Did you read any of these?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Loconte</h4><p begin="00:49:23.49" data-timestamp="2963.49"> I have read through some of them. Ron would forward me some of the more-- some of the particular ones.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:49:29.67" data-timestamp="2969.67"> So they got all this mail, and they had to decide what to do. Maria Vullo, the superintendent, said the decision about whether to let insurance companies charge more comes down to numbers not letters. While people were writing in with the exclamation points, the insurance companies were sending in all kinds of financial data. The state had actuaries who went over it all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:49:49.29" data-timestamp="2989.29"> We look at what their claims were last year. We look at what their administrative expenses are, what percentage of profit. We look at risk adjustment. We look at a whole bunch of things.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:49:57.36" data-timestamp="2997.36"> And here is what they decided. Some of the increase the insurance companies were asking for was unavoidable. But about half the increase they were asking for was because the mandate was being taken away.</p><p begin="00:50:09.12" data-timestamp="3009.12">And here, Vullo and the others made an interesting decision, which is basically, look, you may be right that the mandate going away is going to really mess things up. Maybe lots of healthy people will drop their coverage, but you don't know. We don't have any data. And if we let you raise rates as much as you are asking, for sure, people will drop coverage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:50:29.04" data-timestamp="3029.04"> But I was not going to allow it to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because if you raise rates, people will drop insurance.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:35.91" data-timestamp="3035.91"> Vullo also made this other point. What if you did let them raise rates now, and it turns out a year later, they didn't need to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maria Vullo</h4><p begin="00:50:43.03" data-timestamp="3043.03"> And what if I gave them the 20%, and then it doesn't turn out to be that? Then who's got the money? The consumer or the insurance company?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:52.23" data-timestamp="3052.23"> The insurance company. Yeah, the insurance company. Fair point. And of course, next year, the insurance companies might come back and say, look, our projection was right. We do need to charge more. I hate to think of the letters if that happens.</p><p begin="00:51:07.02" data-timestamp="3067.02">And good news-- it might not happen. The cost of insurance on the exchanges seems like it might finally be leveling out. On average, across the country, rates are dropping by 1% next year. And the policies on the New York exchange right now, they're not really more expensive than other plans.</p><p begin="00:51:24.21" data-timestamp="3084.21">It's just that, unlike most of us, people who get their insurance through their employer or who are on Medicare, Medicaid, which are paid for by the government, these people are really seeing the full cost of their insurance. Some get tax credits to help, but lots don't. Those people have to write a check each month. For a lot of them, it's more than their mortgage or their rent. They are writing the letters we might all be writing if we actually got the bill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:58.53" data-timestamp="3118.53"> David Kestenbaum is one of the producers of our show.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Three: Bladen Runner</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:16.05" data-timestamp="3136.05"> ACT 3, Bladen Runner.</p><p begin="00:52:20.10" data-timestamp="3140.1">OK, so up until now, in our show, we've had stories about people reading words. Now, we have a story about somebody looking into some numbers and noticing things that the rest of us haven't. Ben Calhoun tells the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:52:30.32" data-timestamp="3150.32"> This election cycle, it wasn't strange for voters to have to wait for races to be called. Seems like there were so many squeakers. Among the squeakiest, still unresolved a month after the election, North Carolina's 9th congressional district. The district is this long stretch of eight counties along the state's southern border. It's so gerrymandered, it looks like a hockey stick.</p><p begin="00:52:52.19" data-timestamp="3172.19">In that district, a Republican former Baptist pastor named Mark Harris narrowly beat his Democratic opponent. The Democrat was this Boy Scouty, former Marine named Dan McCready. The margin of victory in that race-- 905 votes-- crazy close, but a win.</p><p begin="00:53:09.32" data-timestamp="3189.32">Until the North Carolina State Board of Elections had a meeting-- the board is four Democrats, four Republicans, one unaffiliated member-- and the board decided in a bipartisan unanimous vote not to approve the results in the ninth congressional district.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Michael Bitzer</h4><p begin="00:53:24.23" data-timestamp="3204.23"> That late Tuesday afternoon decision by the board not to certify the ninth really kind of sent shockwaves through the state.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:53:33.32" data-timestamp="3213.32"> This is Michael Bitzer, PolySci professor at Catawba College in North Carolina.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Michael Bitzer</h4><p begin="00:53:37.97" data-timestamp="3217.97"> To say, this is something that looks pretty serious.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:53:43.55" data-timestamp="3223.55"> Trouble in River City.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Michael Bitzer</h4><p begin="00:53:45.37" data-timestamp="3225.37"> Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:53:47.09" data-timestamp="3227.09"> Bitzer says he can't remember this ever happening before. It turns out, behind this bipartisan emergency break-throwing-- voter fraud allegations, specifically funny business with mail-in absentee ballots. So Bitzer did what PolySci professors do in a crisis like this. He dove into the data, downloaded it from the state. And in it, he saw one thing that didn't look like the others.</p><p begin="00:54:12.71" data-timestamp="3252.71">One county, Bladen county, only 19% of the people voting by mail were registered Republicans. But among the mail-in ballots, the Republican candidate got 61% of the vote. Mathematically, this just seems super unlikely. He'd have to win all the Republicans, and all the independents, and some Democrats.</p><p begin="00:54:34.58" data-timestamp="3274.58">Normally, professors quantify how unusual something is in statistics, standard deviation and that kind of thing. But I have trouble following that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:54:43.16" data-timestamp="3283.16"> If you were Luke Skywalker in this situation, how big was the disturbance in the force?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Michael Bitzer</h4><p begin="00:54:52.30" data-timestamp="3292.3"> Alderaan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:54:54.04" data-timestamp="3294.04"> For those slightly less nerdy than Professor Bitzer and myself, that's the planet that gets destroyed by the Death Star.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:54:59.92" data-timestamp="3299.92"> The destruction of a planet?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Michael Bitzer</h4><p begin="00:55:02.02" data-timestamp="3302.02"> Yes. And just eyeballing it, this is not normal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:55:07.15" data-timestamp="3307.15"> So Bitzer writes a blog post explaining what he was reading in the data that most people had not. Then it spreads rapidly through the internet. And then around the same time, news starts to trickle in.</p><p begin="00:55:19.91" data-timestamp="3319.91">There's stories of voters who say there were people coming and telling them to give them their mail-in absentee ballots before they filled them in. And they handed them over, and then they don't know what happened to their ballot.</p><p begin="00:55:32.08" data-timestamp="3332.08">Reporters started digging around, and they zeroed in on this one particular character who might be behind all this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:55:38.51" data-timestamp="3338.51"> Liz, this is McCrae Dowless. Here's a picture of him on the left there. He's being sworn in as the Bladen county soil and water conservation district supervisor. Now it's Dowless who finds himself in potentially hot water.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:55:52.63" data-timestamp="3352.63"> And when we around this office heard those stories, we were like, wait a minute-- Leslie McCrae Dowless? You mean, the vice chair of the Soil and Water Commission of Bladen county? We know that guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leslie Mccrae Dowless</h4><p begin="00:56:05.62" data-timestamp="3365.62"> Would you like a cigarette, Zoe?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:56:07.04" data-timestamp="3367.04"> No, I'm OK. Thank you though.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:56:10.28" data-timestamp="3370.28"> This is tape of my colleague, Zoe Chace, doing a story in North Carolina two years ago. She's talking to Leslie McCrae Dowless. Zoe was there because Dowless had filed complaints alleging Democratic voter fraud, absentee ballot fraud. She went to this hearing about those complaints, where Dowless' complaints actually got dismissed, found unsubstantiated.</p><p begin="00:56:32.09" data-timestamp="3392.09">But then-- this gets wild-- in the hearing, Dowless gets questioned. And he starts describing things that he and Republican campaign workers have been doing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Attorney</h4><p begin="00:56:42.31" data-timestamp="3402.31"> So you keep saying GOTV. Does that mean--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leslie Mccrae Dowless</h4><p begin="00:56:43.78" data-timestamp="3403.78"> Get out to vote.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Attorney</h4><p begin="00:56:44.75" data-timestamp="3404.75"> You did pay her--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leslie Mccrae Dowless</h4><p begin="00:56:46.03" data-timestamp="3406.03"> Get out to vote.</p><p begin="00:56:46.89" data-timestamp="3406.89">OK, and what exactly was it that she got paid to do?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:56:51.70" data-timestamp="3411.7"> Dowless ended up being accused of paying campaign workers to gather absentee ballots from people, fill them out, and fraudulently vote in their place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:57:00.64" data-timestamp="3420.64"> That is illegal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:57:02.35" data-timestamp="3422.35"> One family signed an affidavit saying Dowless' workers had them request absentee ballots. Those ballots never showed up. And then when they went to vote on election day, they were told they already voted.</p><p begin="00:57:14.14" data-timestamp="3434.14">Dowless insisted he'd done nothing wrong. But this, this is exactly the kind of thing that, if it happened this year, would explain the statistical weirdness that Professor Bitzer found when he was reading the data from Bladen county.</p><p begin="00:57:28.36" data-timestamp="3448.36">In the last few weeks, there have been affidavits from voters in the county, describing what Dowless partially confessed to two years earlier-- campaign workers showing up, asking for their mail-in ballots, offering to fill them in for them. And it turns out, Leslie McCrae Dowless spent this last year in Bladen county, working for the Republican candidate, Mark Harris.</p><p begin="00:57:59.84" data-timestamp="3479.84">We all know the wah-wah-wah of the voter fraud election fraud conversation. Democrats say it's proven not to be happening. Republicans say it does happen. We need tougher laws. Researchers say, no, actually, it's not a problem, to which Republicans say, you're a bunch of liberal academics. We don't trust what you say.</p><p begin="00:58:19.55" data-timestamp="3499.55">Like so much of our political conversation, so enjoyable. So for once, or, I guess, twice now, in North Carolina, we see, when we dive into the data that everyone's wrong and everyone's right. The Democrats must concede that fraud is, apparently, quite possible. The Republicans must concede, at least in this case, it is not the product of a democratic scheme made up of non-ID-having double voters. But if the facts bear out, the largest voter fraud scandal to hit North Carolina in recent memory is the work of a Republican operative bringing votes for a Republican candidate.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:03.97" data-timestamp="3543.97"> Ben Calhoun is one of the producers of our show.
