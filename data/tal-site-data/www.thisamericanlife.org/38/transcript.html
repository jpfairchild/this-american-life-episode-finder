No, it is not enough.</p><p begin="00:00:27.84" data-timestamp="27.84">But what is enough? Some guys come to Civil War reenactments and bring sodas and coolers and Band-Aids. There are guys who wear wristwatches and contact lenses. The thing about recreating the Civil War is that everyone draws the line somewhere else.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 1</h4><p begin="00:00:42.92" data-timestamp="42.92">It's better if I walk in than if I drive in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 2</h4><p begin="00:00:45.59" data-timestamp="45.59">I don't wear no underwear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 3</h4><p begin="00:00:47.73" data-timestamp="47.73">I don't carry pears or bananas or anything like that. Where are they going to get bananas during the Civil War?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 4</h4><p begin="00:00:54.00" data-timestamp="54">I eat raw meat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 5</h4><p begin="00:00:55.54" data-timestamp="55.54">We have people here who believe that their impression's more authentic than somebody else's because they have fleas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 6</h4><p begin="00:01:03.36" data-timestamp="63.36">A Chinese man came to me and wanted to join the unit. There were no Chinese in the 100th. My unit, I would prefer to have just plain old Caucasian males.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:25.65" data-timestamp="85.65">This tape is from a documentary by Jessica Yu called <i>Men of</i> <i>Reenaction.</i> And she found out that when men stage Civil War reenactments, sure, there is some tension between the Union and the Confederate forces. But the real battle is the one within the ranks over who is properly authentic and who is not. And like any conflict that's big enough and important enough to people, this conflict has spawned its own vocabulary. The guys who do these reenactments call themselves either hard-cores or farbs. You can guess what the hard-cores are. Those are the guys who really want to be authentic. Farbs, well, farb is short for far be it from me, as in "far be it from me to judge what that person is doing right over there."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 7</h4><p begin="00:02:11.95" data-timestamp="131.95">A farb? A farb is someone who is not as authentic as you think of yourself. That's the easiest way I put it. A farb is anyone who would wear tennis shoes or would wear modern eye glasses or would wear cotton instead of wool. When I see someone in line and he's got modern glasses, that takes away from my event. It might not affect his event, but it takes away from mine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reenactor 8</h4><p begin="00:02:44.04" data-timestamp="164.04">I'm in this for fun. I'm not really in the Army. And so if I want to have an ice chest hidden in a wooden box that only I know is there, then I will do that. I draw the line at what the public sees and perceives.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:03.93" data-timestamp="183.93">You know, it is hard to imagine people in other countries-- English and French citizens reenacting the Norman conquest or North and South Vietnamese recreating their bloody civil war. The question here is why do Americans devote so much emotional energy to restaging the past?</p><p begin="00:03:30.91" data-timestamp="210.91">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week, of course, we choose a theme, and invite various writers, performers, documentary producers to take a whack at that theme. Our program today, Simulated Worlds. We visit wax museums, simulated coal mines, fake ethnic restaurants, an ersatz Medieval castle, and other recreated worlds that thrive all across our great land.</p><p begin="00:04:05.62" data-timestamp="245.62">The Italian writer Umberto Eco wrote an essay a few years ago in which he argued that this urge to create miniature simulated worlds is a particularly American impulse, a significant American aesthetic and one that is not talked about very often. Eco traveled the United States from Disneyland to Las Vegas to re-creations of old New York in museums. After a visit to the LBJ Library in Austin, Texas, where he saw a full, life-size re-creation of the Oval Office using the same materials as the original, Eco wrote, "Is this the taste of America? Certainly it is not the taste of Frank Lloyd Wright, of the Seagram Building, of the skyscrapers of Mies van der Rohe. But the American imagination demands the real thing, and to attain it must fabricate the absolute fake."</p><p begin="00:04:53.01" data-timestamp="293.01">On today's program, Act One, a quick national tour. Act Two, writer Jack Hitt on simulated dinosaur worlds. Act Three, we get Medieval on you. Well, we take a Medieval scholar from the University of Chicago-- a guy with an actual British accent, so you can tell he's for real-- with us to Medieval Times, a suburban castle cum restaurant cum jousting arena. Act Four, how <i>Morning</i> <i>Edition</i> fakes reality every day on the radio and why we fall for it. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Two: Dinosaur Exhibit</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:36.18" data-timestamp="336.18">Act One, Travels in Hyperreality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wax Museum Guide</h4><p begin="00:05:40.63" data-timestamp="340.63">Now, back to Jesus. The following description is alleged to be derived from an ancient manuscript sent by Publius Lentulus, president of Judea, to the Senate of Rome. It reads, "There lives at this time in Judea a man of singular virtue whose name is Jesus."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:58.32" data-timestamp="358.32">Where are we? A wax museum in San Francisco in front of 13 life-size wax statues recreating Leonardo da Vinci's painting, <i>The</i> <i>Last</i> <i>Supper</i>. In this act of our program, rather than use the Michelin guide to tour America, we're using Umberto Eco's essay, "Travels in Hyperreality." And in researching that essay, Eco visited no fewer than seven-- that's right, seven-- wax versions of <i>The</i> <i>Last</i> <i>Supper</i> between San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p><p begin="00:06:25.32" data-timestamp="385.32">Eco was fascinated with American wax museums, partly because he said that unlike wax museum in other countries, he says, "American wax museums try to reconstruct entire worlds with a kind of maniacal, chilling attention to detail." This museum, for example, runs 85 different soundtracks in its different rooms. There are scenes of wax figures bathing waist deep in real pools of water. There's a full-scale reconstruction of King Tut's tomb. There are three-dimensional life-size wax versions of a dozen of the world's most famous paintings. A typical exhibit in the World Religion section of the museum, Moses receiving the Ten Commandments on a rocky slope, eerie red light with flashes of white lightning.</p><p begin="00:07:07.10" data-timestamp="427.1">[THUNDER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Wax Museum Recording</h4><p begin="00:07:12.99" data-timestamp="432.99">I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other god before me."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:24.64" data-timestamp="444.64">Eco had a name for these over-the-top production values. He called it "reconstructive neurosis."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney Fong</h4><p begin="00:07:34.94" data-timestamp="454.94">My name is Rodney Fong. I'm actually the grandson of the gentleman who opened this museum in 1963. That's my grandfather Thomas Fong.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:42.56" data-timestamp="462.56">Rodney's family owns the largest wax museum in North America, which is in Los Angeles, and the second largest, which is this museum at Fisherman's Wharf. His family owned three wax museums visited by Umberto Eco when Umberto Eco wrote his essay. Rodney himself is an easygoing, friendly sort who grew up working in the museum's shop after school, now 30 years old and the general manager of the place.</p><p begin="00:08:04.04" data-timestamp="484.04">And you might think that growing up in a wax museum would be kind of a fun thing for a kid. But he said that was not his experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney Fong</h4><p begin="00:08:10.16" data-timestamp="490.16">Actually, I was terrified to go into the museum because my father always used the museum as a threat. If we were not good, we'd have to spend a night in the Chamber of Horrors. So actually to this day, I still get the heebie jeebies walking through by myself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:24.07" data-timestamp="504.07">Rodney tells me we have to rush through the museum because there is so much to see. Over 300 statues, historical figures like Neil Armstrong and Geronimo, right next to fictional characters like Don Quixote and Alice in Wonderland. The juxtaposition is actually kind of dizzying. And Umberto Eco talks about this odd feeling you get in a place like this as "a spatial, temporal haze, where centuries get confused." One room, for example, depicts a dozen people at an outdoor cafe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney Fong</h4><p begin="00:08:54.64" data-timestamp="534.64">Mark Twain--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:55.51" data-timestamp="535.51">Smoking a pipe, looking very stern.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney Fong</h4><p begin="00:08:57.10" data-timestamp="537.1">Rembrandt, Caruso, Andy Warhol--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:01.37" data-timestamp="541.37">In a leather jacket.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney Fong</h4><p begin="00:09:03.09" data-timestamp="543.09">Whistler, Beethoven, Toulouse-Lautrec.

I mean, we keep adding figures year after year. We have to start categorizing them and putting them together.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:57.36" data-timestamp="597.36">Eco says that one reason Americans have an urge to build elaborate wax museums, to reenact the Civil War, to construct full-size, fake Colonial towns, is that we just don't have as strong a sense of history as Europeans have. And so it's like we're seeking to ground ourselves in some vivid sense of history. And these are the tools that we use.</p><p begin="00:10:17.31" data-timestamp="617.31">Rodney and I turn a corner, and we see this combination of historical figures. Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin, Galileo, and Bill Gates, in a sweater, holding a copy of Windows 95. That's just down the hallway from a room called "Wickedest Ladies," where the plaques read, "Jezebel, biblical siren," "Salome, biblical siren," "Lucrezia Borgia, siren of the Renaissance," and then there's Mata Hari, who, for some reason, is a dead ringer-- I'm not kidding-- for Barbra Streisand.</p><p begin="00:10:48.20" data-timestamp="648.2">There's also a room with figures that are very mysteriously grouped. They are Boy George, Lawrence Welk, Danny Thomas, John Travolta. What is the theme of this room, OK? Performers you suspect are gay? Scientologists? Has-beens? Rodney has no answers. He takes me to stand in front of a room with just one lone figure, wielding a gun. Chuck Norris.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:14.44" data-timestamp="674.44">Now, why is it that Chuck Norris gets his own room and Nelson Mandela has to share a room with four other people?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney Fong</h4><p begin="00:11:23.99" data-timestamp="683.99">If we had other action figures, they'd be in this room also.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:27.34" data-timestamp="687.34">But for now, Chuck Norris not only gets his own room, he gets a full movie set. That's what it's like. There's a beach with a blown-up car and pieces all around him plus that semiautomatic weapon. The point of all this obsessively reconstructed detail, Umberto Eco says, is partly to reassure people that no expense has been spared. "This," he says, "is what Americans want. An insane abundance, like at those supposedly classy American restaurants, all darkness and wood paneling, dotted with soft red lights that offer the customer, as evidence of his own affluence, steaks four inches thick and lobster and baked potato and sour cream and melted butter and grilled tomato and horseradish sauce, so that the customer will have more and more and can wish nothing further."</p><p begin="00:12:22.05" data-timestamp="742.05">The logical outcome of this desire is places like the Madonna Inn, a hotel in California that Eco describes this way. "The poor words with which human natural speech is provided can not suffice to describe the Madonna Inn. Let us say that Albert Speer, while leafing through a book on Goudy swallowed an over-generous dose of LSD, and began to build a nuptial catacomb for Liza Minnelli. But that doesn't give you an idea. Let's say Arcimboldi builds the Sagrada Familia for Dolly Parton. Or Carmen Miranda designs a Tiffany locale for the Jolly Hotel chain. Calvino's <i>Invisible</i> <i>Cities</i> described by Judith Krantz and executed by Leonor Fini for the plush-doll industry. Chopin's Sonata in B flat minor sung by Perry Como in an arrangement by Liberace accompanied by the Marine Band No, that still isn't right.</p><p begin="00:13:11.03" data-timestamp="791.03">"Let's try talking about the restrooms. They are an immense underground cavern, something like Altamira and Luray, with Byzantine columns supporting plaster baroque cherubs. The basins are big imitation mother-of-pearl shells. The urinal is a fireplace carved from the rock, but when the jet of urine-- sorry, but I do have to explain here-- touches the bottom, water comes down from the wall of the hood in a flushing cascade, something like the caves of the Planet Mongo.</p><p begin="00:13:36.48" data-timestamp="816.48">"Then there are the bedrooms, about 200 of them, each with a different theme. For a reasonable price-- which includes an enormous bed, king or queen size if you are on your honeymoon-- you can have the Prehistoric Room, all cavern and stalactites, the Safari Room, zebra walls and bed shaped like a Bantu idol, the Kona Rock Room, Hawaiian, the California Poppy, the Old-Fashioned Honeymoon, the Irish Hills, the William Tell, the Tall and Short, for mates of different lengths, with the bed in an irregular polygon form. There's the Imperial Family, there's the Old Mill.</p><p begin="00:14:09.60" data-timestamp="849.6">"The Madonna Inn is the poor man's Hearst castle. It has no artistic or philological pretensions. It appeals to the savage taste for the amazing, the overstuffed, and the absolute sumptuous. At a low price, it says to its visitors, 'You can have the incredible, just like a millionaire.'"</p><p begin="00:14:32.95" data-timestamp="872.95">[COAL MINE SOUNDS]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:14:40.88" data-timestamp="880.88">OK, OK, OK. We've changed scene. Maybe you've figured that out. Now we're in a coal mine, a fake coal mine. In fact, we're faking being in a fake coal mine. That's just how fake this is. I'm just sitting in a radio studio playing you a tape. You know, simulated worlds actually are so abundant, within a half-hour drive of where I sit right now here in Chicago, where we broadcast our radio show from, right now, I can jump in the car and visit-- OK, I'm just going to list quickly-- a re-creation of an Al Capone speakeasy, a Medieval castle, a 3-D IMAX movie theater which attempts to recreate three-dimensionality, a store called Nike Town, which essentially puts you into the world of a Nike commercial.</p><p begin="00:15:19.37" data-timestamp="919.37">And at the Museum of Science and Industry, a fake human heart big enough to walk through, an actual 727 airplane, an entire airplane inside the museum, a real German U-boat captured during World War II, and, built directly into the museum, a fake coal mine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tour Guide</h4><p begin="00:15:36.20" data-timestamp="936.2">Now, the first bell will indicate that we are arriving, and the second bell will indicate that we have arrived.

From the survivalists in Montana to the gay community in San Francisco to the Mormons in Utah. Looked at in this way, creating new worlds is what this country is. It is what we do.</p><p begin="00:16:25.87" data-timestamp="985.87">And so when we create these little small, simulated worlds for recreation, wax museums and Medieval castles and technicolor movies, for that matter, we're just doing in miniature, for recreation, what we do for real, as a whole, in our culture.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Three: Medieval Times</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:13.29" data-timestamp="1033.29">Act Two, Dinosaur Exhibit. Well, all this hour, we're talking about simulated realities, simulated worlds, wax museums, Civil War reenactments, fake coal mines. You know, one thing you can say about all those worlds is that anybody can tell that they're fake. When you go to a wax museum, when you go to the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, this huge pyramid with a full-scale replica of the Sphinx out in front, you do not stand there and wonder, "Did I wake up this morning in Cairo?" You know where you are.</p><p begin="00:17:44.10" data-timestamp="1064.1">The world of dinosaurs presents a different problem, and that's because of the veneer of science. When you go to a natural history museum and you see a dinosaur exhibit, the impression that you get is that what you're seeing is not conjecture, not theory, but settled, scientific fact. But as our contributing editor Jack Hitt recently discovered, the world of the dinosaurs turns out to be a man-made world made up of a pile of bones. And like most other things that are man-made, our picture of the dinosaurs has been flawed and imperfect. And it changes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:18:15.54" data-timestamp="1095.54">Not long ago, I attended a lecture by dinosaur revisionist Jack Horner. He's a notorious troublemaker, a hippie without a formal degree who turns dinosaur thinking upside-down. He's a tall, skinny thing in jeans and boots, tangled gray hair and a generous beard. Horner's speech was entitled, "Would Tyrannosaurus Rex Eat a Lawyer?" The reference, of course, is that scene in <i>Jurassic</i> <i>Park</i> when the lawyer gets yanked right off the john by an enraged T. rex.</p><p begin="00:18:42.57" data-timestamp="1122.57">Naturally, we all thought the answer to his semi-rhetorical question was, sure. Of course. T. rex could eat a lawyer anytime, anyplace. But Horner was there to prove that T. rex could only have eaten the lawyer if the lawyer were already dead. T. rex, he said, was not a mighty, roaring predator, not king of the dinosaurs, not Godzilla, but a slow, putzy scavenger who wandered from carcass to carcass half-blind, snacking on rotting scraps.</p><p begin="00:19:08.18" data-timestamp="1148.18">No one in the room quite wanted to believe it. Little kids just sat silent in incredulous awe, as if he had said that sharks only ate plankton. But Horner piled on the logic. Typically, predators, he said, like lions and tigers, have powerful front arms to hold their catch while they rip out the jugular. T. rex has no arms, really. Just those dainty claw-ettes, comparable to having a few fingers growing out of your shoulders. Interesting, but not exactly threatening.</p><p begin="00:19:35.78" data-timestamp="1175.78">T. rex also had big, muscular legs, usually interpreted to mean he could run fast. But Horner asked, how swift are weight lifters? In nature, sprinters tend to have long calves and short thighs for leverage, like ostriches. Animals with stout, muscular legs tend to be walkers, typically slow, usually not too coordinated. Horner was making sense. There were lots of shifting of chairs and coughing.</p><p begin="00:19:59.36" data-timestamp="1199.36">And then there was more. CAT scans of T. rex skulls have revealed a sense of smell more elaborate than any other species except the turkey vulture, a handy adaptation if you're pursuing stinking corpses. Also, his eyesight was poor, not good for predators, who tend to hunt at twilight. At last, Horner said, T. rex didn't even walk the way every book and <i>National</i> <i>Geographic</i> magazine and Spielberg movie has shown us, standing up, constantly roaring, front claws poised to strike. No, instead, he walked about like a sandpiper, a bird, head down, tail straight out, body parallel to the ground, but with all the agility of a penguin.</p><p begin="00:20:43.54" data-timestamp="1243.54">It was a strange feeling in that room, as we all experienced a kind of reverse epiphany, when something you are absolutely certain to be true turns out to be completely false. But you know, once you hear the evidence, it just seems obvious. I mean, those tiny claws. Come on. Weren't they always a tip off?</p><p begin="00:21:02.16" data-timestamp="1262.16">But after a while, I no longer cared about the new T. rex as much as I wanted to know where that older figment, the marauding predator, had come from. We invented him, of course, constructed him from just a few bones. But why? From his office in Montana, Horner told me that the old T. rex was, in part, the creation of a kind of arms race.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Horner</h4><p begin="00:21:22.87" data-timestamp="1282.87">Cope and Marsh. It was a competition.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:21:25.70" data-timestamp="1285.7">Edward Cope and O. C. Marsh, the two Indiana Joneses of the turn of the century. Cope was associated with the University of Pennsylvania, Marsh with Yale. They were called the bone warriors. Two men who hated each other's guts, and every year pursued larger pots of money to fund more elaborate excursions, to find even bigger bones.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Horner</h4><p begin="00:21:43.98" data-timestamp="1303.98">It was during the time of P. T. Barnum. It was during the time when you put up your most fantastic stuff in your museum or your circus or whatever it is you happen to have. And you draw people in. And you're competing with everyone else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:21:59.05" data-timestamp="1319.05">So a lot of T. rex's original persona came not from science but just good old American hucksterism. That's why they forced T. rex to stand unnaturally upright, on his hind legs. Although there was one other reason.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Horner</h4><p begin="00:22:10.41" data-timestamp="1330.41">It's because people made dinosaur halls with very high ceilings, and they had to fill up that extra space with something. But I mean it's hard to tell what it was. I mean, they wanted these animals to look ferocious, so they made them as tall as possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:22:26.67" data-timestamp="1346.67">And to make it as tall as possible, they had to bend the tale of T. rex, and worse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Horner</h4><p begin="00:22:31.22" data-timestamp="1351.22">They broke skeletons. They removed parts. It's funny. I mean, early on, they actually found evidence that animals didn't drag their tails. But in some cases, they actually removed the evidence so they could get the tail on the floor.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:22:50.48" data-timestamp="1370.48">Does it get any more rigged than that? But it isn't just that most of what we thought we knew about dinosaurs was wrong. It turns out that in the century or so since dinosaurs entered human consciousness, they've passed through discernible fashions, changing, not as often as skirts or haircuts, but at a slower pace, like men's lapels, about every 10 to 15 years. They've served as a kind of national psychic Erector Set, which we've put together in different ways depending on our mood.</p><p begin="00:23:17.40" data-timestamp="1397.4">To compile a comprehensive list of dinosaur fashions, I drove back to the first great hall of dinosaurs, New York's Museum of Natural History. Earlier this year, they assembled their dinosaur bones into a new, more so-called "accurate" display. Appropriately enough, before the visitor even gets to see the new exhibit, one has to walk through a tall chamber housing the old standards, the twin icons of dinosaur myth.</p><p begin="00:23:40.76" data-timestamp="1420.76">It was good to see them again. Here was T. rex, head bowed in his new humble position. And across the aisle with his long, gracious neck and frisky, five-ton tail was the old friendly Brontosaurus. I know he has some new name, but I can never remember what it is. Anyway, Brontosaurus and T. rex stand in a room all by themselves these days, obsolete models parked next door to the hipper, newer displays. In other words, dinosaurs of dinosaurs.</p><p begin="00:24:13.10" data-timestamp="1453.1">I was shown around by Philip Fraley, a mounting expert. He's the man who does the actual work of making these bones assume the positions they do. We sat beneath the rear end of the Brontosaurus. Philip tried to take me back to the first decade of the century, when even seeing a dinosaur meant getting on a train and coming to one of the few museums that Cope or Marsh had stocked. Given Fraley's occupation, he wanted me to appreciate something else.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:24:36.45" data-timestamp="1476.45">The beauty of the armature itself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:24:38.88" data-timestamp="1478.88">By armature, Philip means the steel frame that holds the bones up. And I did come to appreciate its beauty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:24:44.71" data-timestamp="1484.71">T-joints and unions, and they've been threaded. Our pelvis weighs 2,000 pounds. So to lift that up and to have 2,000 pounds supported on inch-and-a-half pieces of steel requires a lot of engineering. The tensile strength of the steel, the cantilever weight--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:25:08.14" data-timestamp="1508.14">This was high tech for its time. These creatures had slept forever, and now they were upright for the first time in 100 million years. What had put them back on their feet, literally, was the wrought-iron strength of Pittsburgh steel, the American Industrial Revolution. But the exact dates are also timely. The Brontosaurus went up in 1906 and the T. rex in 1912, just before World War I, when the slumbering giant of America awoke.</p><p begin="00:25:32.27" data-timestamp="1532.27">To the Europeans, we were still a friendly, dumb rube of Tocqueville's <i>Democracy</i> <i>in</i> <i>America.</i> But we were about to prove ourselves as international warriors. The crowds that flooded through New York's museum saw two images, the affable but dim Brontosaurus, and across the aisle, the berserker rage of T. rex, friendly until agitated, then fury, which is how the world came to see us, an amiable, joshing hick who, if provoked, will kick your ass.</p><p begin="00:25:59.56" data-timestamp="1559.56">By World War II, T. rex had become important enough to our nation that, incredibly, there were contingency plans to protect the skeleton the same way we protect the president and the original copy of the Constitution.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:26:10.63" data-timestamp="1570.63">The country felt there was a likelihood that the museum could come under attack by the German Army or the German Navy. And in order to preserve the specimens, they contacted the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:26:28.94" data-timestamp="1588.94">So T. rex was shipped off to Pittsburgh, presumably where the Germans would never go. By the '50s and '60s, technology forever changed the dinosaur, and we came into post-war dinosaur fashion. Where the beast once was made from the T-joints of Bessemer steel, a new substance gave him an improved flexibility.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:26:52.12" data-timestamp="1612.12">Plastics.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:26:53.21" data-timestamp="1613.21">That's right, Benjamin. Plastics. Now any museum could have a perfect reproduction of New York's or Yale's bones. A plaster cast could be reproduced endlessly. But this took interpretation out of the hands of paleontologists and put it directly in the hands of museum curators.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:27:08.47" data-timestamp="1628.47">What they allowed people to do was to put them into some outrageous poses.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:27:14.89" data-timestamp="1634.89">So now dinosaurs could be jimmied into action poses, locked into face to face combat like two upright grizzly bears or reared back ready to assault. This was the '50s dinosaur, the dinosaur of kitsch. They were no longer held up by steel but animated by plastic, the essence of America at that time, a substance and a future entirely of our own making.</p><p begin="00:27:34.89" data-timestamp="1654.89">These plasticized dinosaurs continued until the cutthroat '80s, the decade of Michael Milken. In this era, no longer was the dinosaur a big, dim monster. Now he was a sleek, swift, calculating hunter, the Velociraptor, a six-foot tall predatory entrepreneur who learned and adapted quickly. He was the perfect dinosaur for global capitalism, who'd eventually star in a bestselling book and movie, <i>Jurassic</i> <i>Park.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Muldoon</h4><p begin="00:28:01.57" data-timestamp="1681.57">They're lethal at eight months.

His big scene is when he eats the lawyer. But T. rex is clearly second banana to our new star. His appearance is like Robert Mitchum's cameo in the updated <i>Cape</i> <i>Fear</i>, a wink at the audience from the grizzled original.</p><p begin="00:28:33.82" data-timestamp="1713.82">[DINOSAUR ROARING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:28:40.07" data-timestamp="1720.07">Now, the '90s dinosaur. Philip and I walked into the new dino display, where T. rex and the Brontosaurus hardly seem relevant. We see dinosaur eggs and baby dinosaurs. The ambiance is largely about parenting. The scenes are more ecological and holistic. We are meant to see these animals as part of the natural ecosystem of their time, eggs, babies, parents, death, bones. This is a story about the cycles of life, a warmer tale, a greener tale. This is a story of dinosaurs not as George Patton would see them, but as Al Gore would, emblems of a proper view of the environment. The Eco-saur, who's seen the light of family values and the beauty of biodiversity.</p><p begin="00:29:21.01" data-timestamp="1761.01">And in an era when America's role in the world is uncertain, when solutions to many of its problems are unclear, our nation's dinosaur exhibits speak directly to our time in bright yellow stickers attached directly to the display cases. That message, "We just don't know."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:29:37.34" data-timestamp="1777.34">Like, look at this one right here. Look at this sign. There's a big yellow sign. And it says, "These are all intriguing hypotheses, but the fossils do not give us enough evidence to test whether any of them are correct. The mystery remains unresolved."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:29:52.64" data-timestamp="1792.64">Well, right.

I honestly couldn't put my finger on it at first, but Philip did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:30:14.46" data-timestamp="1814.46">Dinosaurs were the most successful life form that ever lived on this planet, and they became extinct.

What progress we've made.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Philip Fraley</h4><p begin="00:30:37.87" data-timestamp="1837.87">When the dinosaurs died out, the world went on and other species were created.

And so it is no surprise that commoners end up on the playing field with the nobles. And it is the nobles who star in the show. Six knights and six squires, all of them with long hair and fake chain-mail that gives them a look that's part Middle Ages and part Jon Bon Jovi. They start by doing these complicated dressage demonstrations with their horses. They have these beautiful Andalusian stallions. And the horses have been trained to side step and bow and weave in and out in complicated patterns.</p><p begin="00:47:32.83" data-timestamp="2852.83">The knights then do these various kinds of target practice on horseback. The capture flags, they hit bullseyes, they spear tiny brass rings with their lances. None of this, Michael says, would have been part of a real Medieval tournament. This would be practice, practice stuff you do beforehand.</p><p begin="00:47:51.83" data-timestamp="2871.83">Then the arena begins to fill with smoke.

We're told that we're supposed to boo every time the green knight appears. The green knight is set up as the evil knight in this pageant. Michael says that particular color choice is not the best. He says that in the Middle Ages, green was the color of goodness, it was the color of godliness. Think <i>Sir</i> <i>Gawain</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>Green</i> <i>Knight.</i> Black, he says, would have been a more accurate color to represent an evil knight in the Middle Ages, but black representing evil probably would not fly in multicultural, modern America.

And then the jousting begins. Over the course of the evening, we've learned next to no facts or history about the Middle Ages. But Medieval Times does stage a great fight. It's complicated. It's cinematic. As I said earlier, there's music through everything that happens on this arena. It's totally choreographed. It lasts a long time. And it involves no fewer than 14 people and six horses.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:34.01" data-timestamp="3034.01">Green knocked yellow off the horse.

Because often tournaments would-- in fact, this is a misconception about knights. Even when knights went into battle in the battlefield, they got off their horses to fight. The English became the great warriors of the late Middle Ages by getting off their horses just like this and fighting on the ground. Because you couldn't do much on a horse. You could do the lance thing, but you couldn't kill someone up close.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:28.34" data-timestamp="3088.34">By the end of the evening, everybody's been killed except for the evil green knight, who gets sent to the dungeon and one other knight, our knight, the black and white knight. Later, we were told the whole thing's fixed. And they put us on the black and white team, because they knew he was going to win. Michael points out that the whole idea that these knights would try to kill each other is not historically accurate. Most tournaments were not intended as a fight to the finish. But despite this, he liked Medieval Times. In the car on the way home, he said that it was Medieval in spirit, anyway. It was spectacle, it was circus, it was populace, it was lowbrow in the best possible sense.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Camille</h4><p begin="00:51:58.95" data-timestamp="3118.95">There were hundreds of things in there I could have said were inaccurate, inauthentic, in terms of costume, design, action. But I think that's the wrong way to think about it. If that was an accurate representation of a Medieval tournament, people would be bored stiff. They wouldn't go to it. They wouldn't get anybody to it, because they lasted for six days. And they were like conventions of aristocrats. It wasn't the kind of experience that is going to be entertaining to people. So if they were being truly authentic, it would be very boring for us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:30.66" data-timestamp="3150.66">When we driving out to Medieval Times earlier, Michael had said that the thing that appealed to him most about the Middle Ages was this other-ness, the fact that it did not seem like our world at all. And in the car home, I suggested to him that Medieval Times did not create that feeling at all. It was mostly familiar images from movies and storybooks. But he disagreed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Camille</h4><p begin="00:52:48.19" data-timestamp="3168.19">It was weird enough in all the mixtures of strange things in it. I mean, the odd mixture of the modern building and the castle's structure and the long-haired hunky knights that looked like centerfolds from <i>Playgirl</i> with the ways that the things were mixed together. To me, in a strange way, it was Medieval. Because obviously, the Middle Ages is incredibly hybrid and confused. And again, that's what attracts me about it. It's certainly not the age of order and systematic piety that everyone thinks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:22.97" data-timestamp="3202.97">But the strangeness that you're describing is not the strangeness of the Middle Ages. It's the strangeness of America.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Camille</h4><p begin="00:53:28.65" data-timestamp="3208.65">Exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:30.20" data-timestamp="3210.2">Exactly, Michael said. In fact, as far as he's concerned, America is a very Medieval country, far more Medieval than Western Europe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Camille</h4><p begin="00:53:37.30" data-timestamp="3217.3">In the Middle Ages, it was a pioneer culture. They were just beginning to create things. There was a sense of newness moving forward, evangelical, full of weird and wonderful mixtures, ultra-religious, and yet at the same time, ultra-decadent. I think that's one of the reasons why we're so fascinated in America with the Middle Ages. Because we're living it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:56.40" data-timestamp="3236.4">In the commemorative photo they took of us at Medieval Times, the distinguished scholar from the University of Chicago is grinning happily, a paper crown on his head. The little mock frame they put the photo inside says in typeface at the bottom, "Your Knight to Remember." That's knight, K-N-I-G-H-T.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act 4</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:48.13" data-timestamp="3288.13">Act Four, simulated worlds on the radio. I worked for National Public Radio's network headquarters in Washington starting when I was 19 years old, a long time ago. And I would like to talk for a minute about how reality is simulated, is constructed on programs like <i>Morning</i> <i>Edition</i> and <i>All</i> <i>Things</i> <i>Considered</i>, programs I love, programs I worked on.</p><p begin="00:55:13.62" data-timestamp="3313.62">Consider <i>Morning</i> <i>Edition</i>. Bob Edwards, the host of the show, says hello and he mentions a few stories coming up today. And then he says, "First, this news from Carl Kasell." Why does he do that? Well, presumably, Carl is closer to reality. He's closer to the truth, he's closer to the thing being simulated in this simulated world on the radio. And then Carl starts in with the first story. Carl says, today in Russia, somebody did whatever.</p><p begin="00:55:42.23" data-timestamp="3342.23">And then he hands off to a reporter. And again, why does he hand off to the reporter? Well, presumably, the reporter is closer to reality, to the truth, to the thing being simulated in this simulated world. And then the reporter comes on. And the reporter says, OK, today the Russian president said whatever. And then the reporter goes on, at some point during their story, to some piece of tape that they're going to play us. And that piece of tape is maybe 12 seconds, maybe 14 seconds, 17 seconds long. And it's like one long sentence, or maybe two sentences of somebody, some Russian, saying something about something, right?</p><p begin="00:56:17.37" data-timestamp="3377.37">And at that point, we're there. We've gone as far as we can go. We are actually at the real. We're hearing a tape recording made out in the world. This is the real. We have arrived. And it's interesting that the word for that piece of tape in radio journalism is the "actuality." Like, it's this precious piece of the actual world on the radio. Like you have this whole apparatus, and then finally you get to what's real. And what's funny about it is how puny it usually is. Like a sentence or two, you know? That's how much reality you get. That's how much actuality you get.</p></div> </div>
