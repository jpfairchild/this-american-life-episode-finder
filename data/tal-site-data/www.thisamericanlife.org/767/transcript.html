<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:13.51" data-timestamp="13.51"> Democracy-- Seems everybody was doing so well there for a while-- on the move, spreading hope around the world. And now, of course, more and more countries are moving in the other direction.</p><p begin="00:00:23.61" data-timestamp="23.61">There are strongman leaders doing great-- in Poland, Turkey, Serbia, Brazil, lots of other places. Even in our own country, democracy is feeling shakier. What is it-- 1/3 of all Americans think the results of the last election were invalid?</p><p begin="00:00:38.48" data-timestamp="38.48">Hungary had an election last week. Hungary used to be a functioning democracy, but it's gotten less and less so. Once again, this time around, Viktor Orban was named prime minister. He's been prime minister there for the last 12 years. Now, he gets four more-- no term limits over there.</p><p begin="00:00:54.94" data-timestamp="54.94">And to give you a sense of just how stacked the deck was in his favor-- like how extreme it was-- during the entire election, the amount of time Orban's opponents got on state television to make their case to voters was exactly five minutes. I mean, like, for the whole election-- you with me here? Tons of coverage for Orban-- all of it positive-- speeches, interviews, analysis from months. For his opponents-- just five minutes.</p><p begin="00:01:27.20" data-timestamp="87.2">And most of the other TV stations in Hungary followed suit. And the five minutes of the opponents got wasn't even during prime time. It was five minutes on a Wednesday morning for Orban's main opponent-- this guy, Peter Marki-Zay, a newcomer, mayor from a small town.</p><p begin="00:01:44.18" data-timestamp="104.18">Basically, how it went is, two weeks before the election, Marki-Zay went into the TV studio of M1, the state-run news station, sat down at a round table, across from a TV presenter. Hanging between them was an enormous circular timer with a big 5 on it, like a stopwatch.</p><p begin="00:02:01.01" data-timestamp="121.01">Presenter barely finished introducing him before Marki-Zay took a big breath, tilted his head down, like he was a bull charging into the ring, and spoke.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Presenter</h4><p begin="00:02:09.05" data-timestamp="129.05"> [SPEAKING HUNGARIAN]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Marki-Zay</h4><p begin="00:02:10.13" data-timestamp="130.13"> [SPEAKING HUNGARIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:14.60" data-timestamp="134.6"> Thank you very much. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak for five minutes in four years, on behalf of the entire Hungarian opposition, representing some 2 and 1/2 to 3 million people, he says, quickly.</p><p begin="00:02:28.13" data-timestamp="148.13">The rest of what he says is more kind of familiar politician stuff. My opponent is a hypocrite. He's corrupt. He's lying about my record. I will keep my promises to you. I will curb inflation. I will pay more to teachers and police.</p><p begin="00:02:39.94" data-timestamp="159.94">He closes with the opposition slogan-- upwards. The camera pans back from Marki-Zay's face, we see the timer click over to zero, time's up for Marki-Zay. Before Marki-Zay's five minutes, the station played an Orban speech from a couple of days earlier that had lasted an hour. After his five minutes was up, they replayed it.</p><p begin="00:03:07.79" data-timestamp="187.79">Giving exactly five minutes on television to the opposition-- it's like it preserves the appearance of democracy. After all, they're opposition parties. They exist. They can say whatever they want. They appear on television.</p><p begin="00:03:20.48" data-timestamp="200.48">But of course, they don't get a real chance like they would in a real democracy. And one candidate pointed to the absurdity of all that in his five minutes. There's a bunch of parties that ran in this election, and this candidate was from a satirical political party, called the Two-Tailed Dog Party.</p><p begin="00:03:35.93" data-timestamp="215.93">During his five minutes in the middle of his speech, he got a call on his cell phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candidate</h4><p begin="00:03:40.41" data-timestamp="220.41"> [SPEAKING HUNGARIAN]</p><p begin="00:03:41.87" data-timestamp="221.87">[TELEPHONE RINGING]</p><p begin="00:03:44.82" data-timestamp="224.82">[SPEAKING HUNGARIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:46.28" data-timestamp="226.28"> Excuse me one second, he tells the audience. It's the missus. And into the phone, he explains, honey, I'm on TV. I told you about this. Even left a note in the fridge.</p><p begin="00:03:54.87" data-timestamp="234.87">And he tries to get off, but the call just somehow won't end. There's stuff that she wants him to pick up on the way home-- milk, cottage cheese. He keeps saying, OK, look, got to go. Love you. You hang up. No, you hang up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candidate</h4><p begin="00:04:08.82" data-timestamp="248.82"> [SPEAKING HUNGARIAN]</p><p begin="00:04:10.59" data-timestamp="250.59"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:13.80" data-timestamp="253.8"> Then time runs out. He's like, oh, well, we'll have another chance in four years' time, right?</p><p begin="00:04:25.46" data-timestamp="265.46">This year's campaign in Hungary to try to unseat Viktor Orban-- his opponents talked about it like it was their last chance to save democracy. Things have gotten steadily less democratic under 12 years of Orban. If you had four more years, Hungary was going to tip forever into autocracy.</p><p begin="00:04:40.97" data-timestamp="280.97">This was such a real possibility, that the political parties did something they had never done before-- a kind of last gasp, Hail Mary, buzzer beater, "send the rocket to push the asteroid away from the Earth to save humanity" move. And we wanted to witness that close up.</p><p begin="00:04:57.68" data-timestamp="297.68">We have that story, and another story of people not going peacefully towards the fate that seems lined up for them. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:05:13.93" data-timestamp="313.93"></p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: The Brothers Harangazo</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:15.35" data-timestamp="315.35"> Act One, The Brothers Harangazo. OK, so one of our producers, Zoe Chace, flew to Hungary, with producer Diane Wu, in the weeks before the big election. Zoe is somebody who has immersed himself in American politics and elections over the years and covered it.</p><p begin="00:05:30.95" data-timestamp="330.95">And to understand what it's like for the opposition in Hungary, Zoe followed two brothers-- one current and one former member of parliament-- both working to defeat Viktor Orban against, as you'll hear, incredible obstacles that we never see in this country. Here's Zoe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:05:47.35" data-timestamp="347.35"> I don't know when this started exactly, but lately, Hungary has become a symbol in American politics. Tucker Carlson went over there and interviewed Orban for his show. Tucker praises Orban's hard-line stance against migrants-- not just the border fence Orban built, but the rhetoric, that new Muslim immigrants will de-Christianize Europe.</p><p begin="00:06:08.02" data-timestamp="368.02">Orban says things like, will Europe remain the continent of the Europeans? <i>The</i> <i>American</i> <i>Conservative</i> magazine is constantly publishing glowing stories about Hungary's, quote-unquote, "pro-family policies." Meanwhile, on the left, there are all these people trying to make Hungary this canary in the coal mine for the collapse of democracy, as though that's where we're headed, too. America is going to become an autocracy.</p><p begin="00:06:32.56" data-timestamp="392.56">I don't buy that, despite how similar some of this stuff sounds between our countries. And one of the reasons I don't is because of what the opposition did in this recent election. It was really different from anything I've ever seen in America.</p><p begin="00:06:46.33" data-timestamp="406.33">I found two people right in the middle of it. They're brothers. First, the elder one, Gabor Harangazo. He's a leftist, a lifelong socialist. He came into parliament in 2010, right when Orban took power.</p><p begin="00:07:01.30" data-timestamp="421.3">And he was miserable, he says, right from the beginning. Orban was radically changing things around with his ruling party, Fidesz. Gabor sighs a lot when he talks about Hungary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:07:12.79" data-timestamp="432.79"> Imagine, the first six months in the Hungarian parliament, I was sick-- physically sick-- because of what I could see that Fidesz has changed the whole country. [SIGHS] It was very bad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:07:31.15" data-timestamp="451.15"> Gabor watched as Orban and his Fidesz party took over big parts of the media, forced out all these civil servants, pushed out all these judges, remade key government oversight jobs-- the public prosecutor, the budget counsel-- so that he could stack them with loyalists with long tenures-- basically, just centralizing and consolidating the government in ways that would allow them to maintain a grip on power even if they lost the majority.</p><p begin="00:07:55.48" data-timestamp="475.48">And along the way, Orban made policies lots of Hungarians loved. He increased pensions, gave big tax refunds for families with kids. He won a lot of loyal voters.</p><p begin="00:08:05.92" data-timestamp="485.92">But to Gabor, Hungary was looking less and less like a free country. He'd hear about something, and he'd be like, no, that's too far.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:08:13.81" data-timestamp="493.81"> Oh, it's too much. They wouldn't do it. But they did it. And--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:08:18.13" data-timestamp="498.13"> Kicking universities out of the country, the country's biggest newspaper shut down in a day-- in 2020, Gabor and the rest of the opposition started working on a way to get Orban voted out. The idea was get all the biggest political parties to unite against Viktor Orban-- from the socialist to the right wing, and the four parties in between.</p><p begin="00:08:39.82" data-timestamp="519.82">There was one party that Gabor knew would be the hardest to work with-- Jobbik, a party that had recently had actual fascists in it. When Gabor first joined parliament, Jobbik representatives harassed him from the floor of the parliament, yelling that socialists should be hanged in the public square.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:08:58.36" data-timestamp="538.36"> When I became a member of the Hungarian parliament, I was seated in the building just next to Jobbik. And they really hated us. There was very, very big hate towards the socialist party from Jobbik.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:09:22.33" data-timestamp="562.33"> This was part of why he felt so sick trying to function in the parliament. But after 10 years of Orban, things got so bad, Gabor was like, nothing matters but getting rid of Orban. We need a competitive democracy back.</p><p begin="00:09:36.07" data-timestamp="576.07">If the biggest parties get together and put all our voters together, maybe together, it's enough to vote him out. The coalition's name was United for Hungary. This winter, in the run-up to the election, instead of each party nominating their own candidate for prime minister, they united behind just one guy-- Peter Marki-Zay, the guy who only got five minutes on state TV-- and all the parties campaigned for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:10:01.09" data-timestamp="601.09"> I had really a lot of problem with Jobbik, and now, we will govern together if everything goes well.

You'd know things have gotten really bad here for the Democrats to make a compromise like that.</p><p begin="00:10:32.75" data-timestamp="632.75">The day I met Gabor, I stumbled upon him in the midst of something rather amazing-- to me. This was a little more than a month before the election. I found him in his office in an old Communist Party building-- just Gabor and a desk, and a large drum set. He used to be in a band-- a band whose name translates to Fairy Louis Pop Show.</p><p begin="00:10:53.48" data-timestamp="653.48">And he recently bought this set for himself, because he's so stressed out these days. He says he plays every morning. It's a strong contrast to his academicky affect.</p><p begin="00:11:04.28" data-timestamp="664.28">He had the Google Doc of the opposition's whole platform open on his laptop-- everything they stood for, everything they wanted to change, including a whole new constitution. It was a plan to save Hungary's democracy that six different political parties have had to agree on. It was right there in front of me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:11:21.98" data-timestamp="681.98"> And there were some minor amendments for today, and we just finished it.

What you might expect from a country's constitution--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:11:51.29" data-timestamp="711.29"> Re-creation of the rule of law, independence of judges, guarantees of basic rights.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:12:02.04" data-timestamp="722.04"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:12:02.93" data-timestamp="722.93"> I think of a constitution as pretty settled-- not like you'd win an election, and get to rewrite the founding document of the country. But when Orban came in with his party, Fidesz, 12 years ago, that's what he did.</p><p begin="00:12:14.81" data-timestamp="734.81">First, he used Fidesz' 2/3 majority to scrap the rule that you need 4/5 of the parliament to change the constitution. And then, his 2/3 majority voted in a new constitution. The new constitution outlines certain values-- a commitment that Hungary remain Christian, that marriage was between a man and a woman, as examples.</p><p begin="00:12:34.97" data-timestamp="754.97">Orban and his 2/3 majority then totally remade the judiciary, the constitutional court, in a way that made it subservient to the governing party, Fidesz. Gabor comes across as both tired and excited today, because today is supposedly the last day-- the day they are finishing the plan after overcoming all the disagreements.</p><p begin="00:12:54.95" data-timestamp="774.95">But there's this glitch, a conflict, with Jobbik around the use of this one word that I guess, to be honest, I'd consider fundamental to any constitution if I had to pick one. Jobbik doesn't like this word.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:13:08.00" data-timestamp="788"> They don't like to use the word, equality.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:14.19" data-timestamp="794.19"> So what is the word in Hungarian?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:13:16.01" data-timestamp="796.01"> [HUNGARIAN]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:18.08" data-timestamp="798.08"> OK. They don't like that word?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:13:19.55" data-timestamp="799.55"> No. Because it's too leftist. Even not in the gender chapter. When we wrote in the gender chapter that-- it was a title that-- equality between men and women, and they didn't agree with it, so we had to delete this sentence. Because the equality is not supported by them, because we are not the same.</p><p begin="00:13:48.86" data-timestamp="828.86">And we couldn't explain them that equality doesn't mean the same. It means that we have equal rights. We need to get equal salaries. And equality is not meaning that the same.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:14:04.58" data-timestamp="844.58"> OK, but to be fair, Jobbik has to walk a super careful line. If they seem too left-wing now, their voters will just vote for Fidesz, Orban's party. Gabor and the socialists have to listen to Jobbik. They're the only party that's going to bring in any right-wing voters to this coalition. The coalition needs Jobbik voters.</p><p begin="00:14:23.36" data-timestamp="863.36">And Jobbik's more tolerable now for socialists. It's easier for him to listen to them. In the last few years, as they've lost voters to Orban's Fidesz, Jobbik has chosen to moderate. I talked with some of them about it. They've gone Jeff Sessions to Jeff Flake.</p><p begin="00:14:38.81" data-timestamp="878.81">You could think of today's Jobbik as sort of centrist Republicans. Anti-corruption is their big issue. Gabor called them Never Trumpers to me. Never Orbanists, he said.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:14:51.35" data-timestamp="891.35"> What does the word, equality, symbolize to the Jobbik voter, that is bad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:15:01.01" data-timestamp="901.01"> OK, mainly two things. One is, they are anti-communist. And in older generation, equality can somehow can be connected to communist ideas.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:20.31" data-timestamp="920.31"> I see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:15:21.09" data-timestamp="921.09"> And that's--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:21.81" data-timestamp="921.81"> We are all the same. There's something communist about that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:15:25.71" data-timestamp="925.71"> And that's what they really would like to avoid, to be able to say that you are flirting with communist ideas or something like this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:36.93" data-timestamp="936.93"> It was a signal, some kind of signal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:15:39.06" data-timestamp="939.06"> Yes, yes, yes. And the other reason is Fidesz has a very successful campaign against LGBTI rights.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:50.34" data-timestamp="950.34"> Fidesz, Orban's party, the governing party-- they've recently sponsored a referendum on a law to, for one, get rid of any kind of materials that deal with gay stuff in schools. To safeguard Christian values against Western liberalism-- is how Orban puts it.</p><p begin="00:16:07.35" data-timestamp="967.35">It's a little more hardcore than what Florida is doing here, but similar. Even the same language promoting it, I noticed-- protect our children. The Hungarian version is, stop the gender madness coming from Brussels, home of the EU.</p><p begin="00:16:23.37" data-timestamp="983.37">The thinking was, all this might appeal to Jobbik's voters also. So the socialists, and everyone else in the opposition, agreed, yeah, let's duck this whole thing by leaving any remotely gay issues out of their platform. And they went with Jobbik's ask and didn't include the word, equality, in the gender chapter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:16:42.22" data-timestamp="1002.22"> So that's why-- this is the other reason why they try to take out from all of our papers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:16:51.47" data-timestamp="1011.47"> The word, equality, is a little bit gay.</p><p begin="00:16:56.30" data-timestamp="1016.3">There are nine other issues that they all think are too gay to agree on-- things they're not going to go near-- the obvious ones, like raising taxes, and then esoteric ones, like nuclear power. Remember, the greens are in this coalition.</p><p begin="00:17:10.83" data-timestamp="1030.83">I just-- I really like this example about equality and the gays, because it's easy to say you want to compromise so everyone can come together to defeat autocracy, but what if that means leaving gay people out of your human rights program? Is that a compromise worth making?</p><p begin="00:17:27.36" data-timestamp="1047.36">To me, it shows how afraid they are in Hungary at this moment. You'll see what they give up. In the US, you hear people on the left say how scared they are that Donald Trump will return to power. But they don't seem scared like the people I talk to in Hungary. They don't seem ready to make those kind of compromises, those kind of sacrifices, in order to win conservative voters who might not want to vote for Trump.</p><p begin="00:17:52.56" data-timestamp="1072.56">Anyway, the compromises were all hard. And even though Gabor thought they were done, it wasn't until two weeks before the election that the opposition went public with their platform. Gabor felt the clock ticking.</p><p begin="00:18:04.47" data-timestamp="1084.47">These delays were deeply frustrating to him. They gave him a fiddling-while-Rome-burns-type feeling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gabor Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:18:10.59" data-timestamp="1090.59"> Because we think that this is our last-- maybe not the last chance, but if lose this chance, then-- [SIGHS] it can happen that it was the last chance, yes. Of course, the opposition parties could work together for another four years. But-- [SIGHS] I'm afraid that many, many people will lose their faith that change could be any time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:18:46.23" data-timestamp="1126.23"> He has relatives who are afraid to say out loud what they think.

But the biggest hurdle, I believe-- it's letting voters know what they're even doing.</p><p begin="00:19:40.35" data-timestamp="1180.35">It's like, is a campaign a campaign if no one knows you're campaigning? That challenge-- I didn't really understand how big it was until I hung out with Tamas Harangazo, Gabor's younger brother.</p><p begin="00:19:52.62" data-timestamp="1192.62">He's brasher, louder. Gabor's more stoic. Tamas is jumpier. He's part of the coalition, too. Since the beginning, he's been there with Gabor. He's also a socialist. He's out here trying to win his seat in parliament.</p><p begin="00:20:06.03" data-timestamp="1206.03">I met him in his campaign office, in Szekszard, where the boys grew up. And there were all these things that were both like elections I know, and totally unlike elections I know, at the campaign offices I went to in Hungary.</p><p begin="00:20:18.33" data-timestamp="1218.33">There were campaign managers, maps, schedules, swag with the candidate's name on it, pizza boxes, and pastries, and coffee, and all the things you expect to see exactly in a campaign office. And talking to Tamas, at first, it was what I expect.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:20:34.42" data-timestamp="1234.42"> What are you guys discussing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamas Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:20:36.51" data-timestamp="1236.51"> Campaign.</p><p begin="00:20:37.05" data-timestamp="1237.05">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:20:39.15" data-timestamp="1239.15">Every Wednesday, we are planning the next week, summarizing the last week, planning the next week and the next two weeks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:20:48.87" data-timestamp="1248.87"> Like, what doors to knock on and stuff like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamas Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:20:51.96" data-timestamp="1251.96"> Everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:20:53.10" data-timestamp="1253.1"> But quickly, the bizarre, surreal hoops he had to jump through in order to campaign in Hungary became clear to me. They're planning how to get their campaign literature out. Looks regular, but here's the Hungarian part. There is a policy in Hungary, Tamas is explaining to me. The postal service won't send campaign literature through the mail.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamas Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:21:13.53" data-timestamp="1273.53"> Last spring, the government changed the rule, and the Hungarian post do not handle flyers and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:21:23.97" data-timestamp="1283.97"> Like, campaign literature?

Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:21:30.93" data-timestamp="1290.93"> Here's how this restriction works. It's tricky. It's diabolical. One year before this election, the postal service stopped accepting political mailings or business flyers.</p><p begin="00:21:42.15" data-timestamp="1302.15">You know, sign up for this service, or vote for this guy-- you can't send that stuff through the postal service. OK.

It's not that Orban's party, the governing party, Fidesz, runs everything. It influences everything. Orban and his buddies tend to profit from that.</p><p begin="00:22:27.75" data-timestamp="1347.75">Tamas says the local distributor guy has a contract with the local newspaper, which is currently owned by this media foundation that's run by pro-government people. And because the distributor needs that business, it refuses to work with the opposition to mail their campaign flyers.</p><p begin="00:22:43.68" data-timestamp="1363.68">There's a handful of public advertising companies linked to the government in various ways that lock the opposition out. Ergo, Tamas' campaign has to deliver all their campaign mailers by hand. Billboards are another big example. It's hard for them to get billboards. It's sneaky, the shadow state.</p><p begin="00:23:03.87" data-timestamp="1383.87">One of the few things the opposition has been able to do is hold rallies. Some are pretty big, like an event they had in Szekszard-- Tamas' area. The prime minister candidate showed up. I saw pictures. It was a big turnout. But of course, because the local paper is owned by an Orban-friendly group--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamas Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:23:21.18" data-timestamp="1401.18"> It never happened.

It's how stifling it is inside the actual parliament. You can't do anything. Like, you really can't do anything in the minority.</p><p begin="00:23:51.69" data-timestamp="1431.69">Tamas keeps showing up to work, though. The parliament building is a big, beautiful, spiky, castle-looking building-- more "Brothers Grimm" than Disney, which is regionally appropriate. What happens inside is normal parliament stuff.</p><p begin="00:24:04.62" data-timestamp="1444.62">Tamas comes in, takes his place. He speaks out against the Orban laws, which come fast and furious. But it's like a weird Dadaist performance. There used to be a sort of C-SPAN broadcasting what was going on in there. Orban shut it down.</p><p begin="00:24:19.29" data-timestamp="1459.29">Television, radio, and newspapers will not report on his arguments. But he says, if he doesn't show up and say something, that's kind of like the whole democracy is throwing in the towel. There has to be debate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamas Harangazo</h4><p begin="00:24:31.80" data-timestamp="1471.8"> If you take it away, then you take away the spirit of not just democracy, but the chance to change.

Hungary is a similar situation. There is independent media that's not influenced by Orban, but it's mostly online, and you have to know about it to go find it. You have to want it.</p><p begin="00:25:54.66" data-timestamp="1554.66">Fidesz supporters are often rural and older. They have the TV and the radio on, it's controlled by the state, and they think the opposition is lying. The new phrase in Hungarian for "fake news" is "fake news."</p><p begin="00:26:07.86" data-timestamp="1567.86">This is the thing that's most similar, in my view, between Hungary and America-- the media situation. There, the right-wing values on radio and TV are enforced by the state. Here, we self-segregate into our own bubbles. But we also live in two different media universes.</p><p begin="00:26:30.87" data-timestamp="1590.87">A month before election day, Russia invaded Ukraine. Hungary borders Ukraine, and refugees were pouring in. Hungarians were really scared about the war. Orban started saying the opposition wanted to send Hungarian troops to fight in Ukraine-- incredibly unpopular, also totally untrue. The state media repeated this line endlessly.</p><p begin="00:26:53.71" data-timestamp="1613.71">On the other hand, Orban's so close to Putin, people in the opposition thought, this war can't help Orban.

<h3>Act Two: Putin&#8217;s On Our Side</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:37.34" data-timestamp="2017.34"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our show, "Do Not Go Gentle"-- stories of people doing whatever they can think of to fight back, to resist, to say no, to what fate seems to have in store for them. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, Putin's on Our Side.</p><p begin="00:33:54.36" data-timestamp="2034.36">So the laws on reporting the news in Russia have changed since the invasion of Ukraine. You may have heard about this. If you're a media outlet in Russia, you cannot use the word "war" to characterize the Russian invasion of Ukraine. You have to call it a "special military operation."</p><p begin="00:34:07.44" data-timestamp="2047.44">You can't talk about Ukrainian civilians being bombed. <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta</i> is one of the oldest independent newspapers in Russia. Its editor-in-chief won the Nobel Peace Prize last year.</p><p begin="00:34:17.52" data-timestamp="2057.52">And when the war began, it didn't follow those new rules from the Russian government. It did straight accurate reporting. Then, the Russian Ministry of Defense sent a written warning saying all their news was fake news.</p><p begin="00:34:30.75" data-timestamp="2070.75">They couldn't keep operating the way they had. They could be shut down, which left the paper to figure out what to do, how to report on the war. And what they came up with was pretty ingenious. One of our producers, Robyn Semien, tells the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:34:45.92" data-timestamp="2085.92"> Reporting in Russia has all sorts of perils. Since Putin has been in power, <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta</i> has seen six of its journalists murdered by methods that include poison and gunshots at close range. They've had other journalists threatened. And it was clear that the new rules on reporting on Ukraine and the warning the paper got from the government would require new tactics.</p><p begin="00:35:08.47" data-timestamp="2108.47">So the first thing the paper did-- this was in early March. They removed any story they'd run that potentially broke the law, like the one called "Putin Invades Ukraine," or "There's No Justification for this War." Or the cover story, "Russia is Bombing Ukraine," was gone, taken down. I talked to Nikita Kondratiev, the Head of News there, about this pause. Nikita said, they had to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:35:34.15" data-timestamp="2134.15"> Stop printing the news for a while, just to understand how to exist in this new reality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:35:42.82" data-timestamp="2142.82"> Nikita had watched as just this year, other independent news outlets, one by one, had succumbed to the pressure and closed, fled, or been taken over by state media.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:35:52.64" data-timestamp="2152.64"> Dozhd is "rain" in Russian, so TV Rain-- they--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:35:56.62" data-timestamp="2156.62"> First, TV Rain shut down. Meduza's reporters fled the country. Nikita knows this by heart. There are others.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:36:03.84" data-timestamp="2163.84"> There is a media outlet called MediaZona. They also fled the country. Who else? The oldest liberal radio station called Echo of Moscow, Ekho Moskvy, closed. Now, their radio frequency is now occupied by state propaganda radio, called Sputnik.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:36:27.76" data-timestamp="2187.76"> <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta</i> was the last major independent media outlet in the country, and they'd stopped reporting on the war to figure out their next move.</p><p begin="00:36:41.58" data-timestamp="2201.58">Just days into that pause, a story fell into Nikita's lap that would reshape the paper's entire approach to their coverage. He was sent audio recordings of police brutality. The recordings had been made secretly by Russian civilians-- women, specifically-- many from a feminist anti-war group, who'd been out protesting the Russian invasion one afternoon in early March and were taken into police custody. Hours later, Nikita listened to it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:37:07.02" data-timestamp="2227.02"> It was during the night, and I just had to wake some of my colleagues up to help me with this recording. That's not any news for us that people are tortured in police departments and so on. But just before the 8th of March, before the International Women's Day and on a peaceful protest like that, policemen tried to torture and beat young women students-- that was shocking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:37:41.50" data-timestamp="2261.5"> It was shocking to them, because peaceful protests are legal in Russia. And up till now, there wasn't such blatant evidence of this kind of misogyny and violence directed at young women, college students, feminists.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:37:53.88" data-timestamp="2273.88"> What was the discussion inside your newsroom about the importance of running this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:37:59.16" data-timestamp="2279.16"> Their reaction was just shit, fuck, that shit is fucked up.

We have to report it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:38:19.29" data-timestamp="2299.29"> Important enough, they decided to start publishing again. This was <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta's</i> first big multi-part story. It is explicitly not set in Ukraine or talking to Ukrainians about the war, but instead, about Russian resistance to the same war-- the one they had to shut up about.</p><p begin="00:38:36.99" data-timestamp="2316.99">I'm going to play you some of these recordings, because this was news, even for veteran journalists like Nikita, who've seen and reported on corrupt and shockingly dark stuff. I also want to play these, because in them, you can hear the variety of ways that the protesters deal with the cops.</p><p begin="00:38:52.26" data-timestamp="2332.26">Their personalities are so present. They don't cower. In fact, they really do the opposite. They assert who they are in the face of real violence.

This will only get exponentially worse for you. And Aleksandra asked, point blank, are you threatening me?

You're fucking scum.</p><p begin="00:51:27.24" data-timestamp="3087.24">Within weeks of that afternoon at the precinct, Vladimir Putin gave a speech classifying Russians into two categories-- true patriots, and pro-West scum and traders, who should be spit out like gnats, he said, cleansed from society. Marina said she heard it, especially the part about scum and traitors. And she knew he was talking about her, and she felt bad. Things are getting worse, she said, for all Russians.</p><p begin="00:51:59.76" data-timestamp="3119.76">So this story in <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta</i> became a model for other stories for how to talk about the war without getting shut down. They talked to mothers whose sons were captured in Ukraine, and covered funerals of fallen soldiers from small Russian towns. One of their more daring attempts-- Nikita calls it "the golden one"-- was to send one of their star reporters to the front lines.</p><p begin="00:52:21.75" data-timestamp="3141.75">Nikita said, they thought since everything the reporter described she'd seen herself with her own eyes, the report couldn't be considered false information. But it didn't work. They had to take that one down. I talked to Nikita about this in mid-March.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:52:37.35" data-timestamp="3157.35"> Have there been moments when you thought that your paper-- that <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta</i> might be shut down? How often are you having that thought?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:52:46.50" data-timestamp="3166.5"> Once a month. Once a month, our editor-in-chief, Mr. Muratov, approaches us and says, I think it's time to close the paper. But it never happens.</p><p begin="00:52:57.96" data-timestamp="3177.96">Like, it exists thirty years already. And every month, someone threatens us, someone tries to kill us, and we are still working. I think that's a miracle.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:53:13.50" data-timestamp="3193.5"> Why do you think you haven't been forced to close yet?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nikita Kondratiev</h4><p begin="00:53:17.40" data-timestamp="3197.4"> We do not know why the government haven't shut us down yet. We have no freaking idea why this is not happening. Every morning, we wake up, and we check our website.</p><p begin="00:53:31.35" data-timestamp="3211.35">And every morning, we are wondering. We have no idea. Maybe it's the Nobel Prize. Maybe Mr. Putin reads us in the evenings, I hope, and he just did not want to lose his favorite newspaper. [CHUCKLES] I don't know. Really, we have no idea.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:53:54.05" data-timestamp="3234.05"> The procedure for shutting down a media outlet in Russia is this-- a federal agency, a media watchdog, sends you a warning in writing. If you get two or more of these in a year, you can lose your reporting license. <i>Novaya</i> <i>Gazeta</i> got two warnings within days-- for not properly identifying a foreign non-profit organization in their reporting.</p><p begin="00:54:15.44" data-timestamp="3255.44">The warnings, Nikita said, were something exceptional, in the sense that normally, they'd just be fined for a small mistake like that. These warnings didn't even bother to say which article got it wrong. The first warning was on March 22, the same day editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov announced he'd be auctioning his Nobel Prize and giving the proceeds to Ukraine.</p><p begin="00:54:37.19" data-timestamp="3277.19">The theory is, Putin's people didn't like that. But please remember, Nikita tells me, it's just a theory. On Monday, March 28, the paper stopped publishing news stories. "We are suspending work," they posted online-- and in smaller writing, a promise to readers-- to continue reporting after the end of the, quote, "special operation" on the territory in Ukraine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:13.86" data-timestamp="3313.86"> Robyn Semien is one of the producers of our show.</p><p begin="00:55:17.28" data-timestamp="3317.28">[MUSIC - "RAGE" BY THE JERKS]</p><p begin="00:55:20.62" data-timestamp="3320.62"></p></div> </div>
