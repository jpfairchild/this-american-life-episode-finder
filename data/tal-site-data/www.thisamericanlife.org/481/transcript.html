<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.57" data-timestamp="0.57"> Tuesday, Tucson, Arizona.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:00:04.25" data-timestamp="4.25"> How are you feeling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:00:05.96" data-timestamp="5.96">I'm scared.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:09.96" data-timestamp="9.96">Rediet Seifu moved to the United States from Ethiopia four months ago. She's learning English. And once a week, one of her teachers from the City High School in Tuscon, Sarah Bromer, takes her to Ike's coffee shop to practice a simple English conversation.</p><p begin="00:00:23.82" data-timestamp="23.82">It goes like this-- Rediet orders tea. That's it, actually. That's the whole thing. Usually, they walk past the door four or five times before she even gets the courage to go inside to do this. And they rehearse beforehand.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:00:35.60" data-timestamp="35.6">So she's going to go-- she calls everybody hon. Do you know what that means? Like honey?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:00:40.71" data-timestamp="40.71">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.51" data-timestamp="41.51">Today, for the very first time, Ms. Bromer is making Rediet order without her help.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:00:47.33" data-timestamp="47.33">She might say, hey, hon, what do you want? Or I bet she'll say, hey, hon, what can I get for you? You'll say--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:00:57.65" data-timestamp="57.65">I would like a tea, please.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:00:59.52" data-timestamp="59.52">And then what if she says, what? What? Pardon me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:01:03.15" data-timestamp="63.15">A tea. You confused me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:09.09" data-timestamp="69.09">Ms. Bromer's actually teasing Rediet by saying, "What?" She knows that this is Rediet's biggest fear, that people will not understand her, that they're going to say, what? What? What was that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:01:18.70" data-timestamp="78.7">Well, that's what you're afraid of, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:01:20.85" data-timestamp="80.85">You confused me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:01:22.68" data-timestamp="82.68">You're afraid, right, you're going to say, can I have a tea? And then she's going to go, what? What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:01:31.22" data-timestamp="91.22">Tea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:01:33.53" data-timestamp="93.53">No, you're saying it just fine. She's going to know what you want. I'm just kidding. You'll say, I want a tea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:01:38.84" data-timestamp="98.84">OK. I want a tea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:01:42.00" data-timestamp="102">Good. She'll say, what kind do you want?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rediet Seifu</h4><p begin="00:01:44.07" data-timestamp="104.07">Honeybush tea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Bromer</h4><p begin="00:01:45.00" data-timestamp="105">Huh?</p><p begin="00:01:45.92" data-timestamp="105.92">[GIGGLING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:50.09" data-timestamp="110.09">OK, they practice a few more times.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:19.46" data-timestamp="199.46">I'm Ira Glass. This week on our radio program, we're trying something unusual for us. This is the second time we've done this. Instead of our usual picking a theme and finding stories on the theme, the theme this week will simply be the week, the week that we all just lived through, these past seven days. Everything on the show has just happened, including stories that are so small and personal-- like, you know, Rediet ordering her first tea-- that they would never belong on a regular news show.</p><p begin="00:03:45.94" data-timestamp="225.94">And we have stories that are bigger, too, like this next woman, whose husband is Syrian. They lived there again in Syria till January, when it got too unstable. And she came to America, where she grew up. And then something bad happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:03:59.35" data-timestamp="239.35">I don't know. Really, I don't believe this could be happening. It seems like something that would happen in movies or in a book.

The things that the world originally negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto about climate change are about to expire. If all goes as planned, the delegates here hope to recommit to them.</p><p begin="00:06:04.59" data-timestamp="364.59">But their bigger mission-- for instance, limiting the increase in world temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, which the world's governments committed to in 2009 in Copenhagen-- is starting to seem impossible, meaning more hurricane Sandys, more drought, more floods more frequently. A typhoon called Bopha hit the Philippines on Tuesday with a death toll that'll probably be twice that of Hurricane Sandy. This man speaking is the lead negotiator from the Philippines, Naderev Sano, giving a speech that becomes, as you'll hear, very unusual for this deeply bureaucratic, diplomatic setting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Naderev Sano</h4><p begin="00:06:40.24" data-timestamp="400.24">An important backdrop for my delegation is the profound impacts of climate change that we are already confronting. And as we see here, every single hour, even as we vacillate and procrastinate here, we are suffering. Madam Chair, we have never had a typhoon like Bopha, which has wreaked havoc in a part of the country that has never seen a storm like this in half a century.</p><p begin="00:07:03.42" data-timestamp="423.42">Finally, Madam Chair, I'm making an urgent appeal, not as a negotiator, not as a leader of my delegation, but as a Filipino. I appeal to the whole world. I appeal to the leaders from all over the world to open our eyes to the stark reality that we face. I appeal to ministers.</p><p begin="00:07:26.64" data-timestamp="446.64">The outcome of our work is not about what our political masters want. It is about what is demanded of us by 7 billion people. I appeal to all-- please, no more delays. No more excuses. Please, let Doha be remembered as the place where we found the political will to turn things around.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Mcgill</h4><p begin="00:07:56.77" data-timestamp="476.77">No choo-choo out of the train.

<h3>Act One: Kabul, Afghanistan</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:01.87" data-timestamp="661.87">This past Saturday, the first of the seven days that we're covering in today's show, I Skyped with Hyder Akbar-- he's in Kabul, Afghanistan-- to find out if anything was happening there that might be interesting for the radio. Hyder's been on our show a few times. He grew up in California, but his family is from Afghanistan. After college, Hyder moved there.</p><p begin="00:11:19.40" data-timestamp="679.4">He said that one of the guys that he's close to, Josef, was thinking about traveling to Kunar Province. That's where he's from. This is an area that's been a Taliban stronghold in the past. It's on the border with Pakistan.</p><p begin="00:11:31.35" data-timestamp="691.35">If the Afghan government were to lose control of the country to the Taliban, it would probably start in Kunar. And that's a real possibility-- civil war, the government falling. So what's happening in Kunar right now tells us whether that is in the cards in the future.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:11:46.32" data-timestamp="706.32">Let me grab Josef, who's here, who actually was trying to get my dad to let him go back home tomorrow. I can bring him in here and talk to him about what's going on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:59.12" data-timestamp="719.12">That seems great. Yeah, bring him in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:12:00.00" data-timestamp="720">What are you doing when you [INAUDIBLE]? OK, just a second. Let me--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:03.35" data-timestamp="723.35">So Josef shows up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:12:05.16" data-timestamp="725.16">[SPEAKING ARABIC].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:06.85" data-timestamp="726.85">And Hyder asks him what's happening in Kunar right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josef</h4><p begin="00:12:09.87" data-timestamp="729.87">[SPEAKING ARABIC].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:12:12.11" data-timestamp="732.11">Oh. Oh. He says the most interesting thing is that the Americans have just pulled out of an area called Pashangar, in his area, where there was almost like a local militia with them and then the Americans controlling them. And they pulled out of that base. And now the problems have started.</p><p begin="00:12:31.93" data-timestamp="751.93">And they're warning everybody, they're telling everybody, look, the Americans are leaving. The Americans are out. We're coming for you guys. We're going to go after whoever cooperated with the Afghan government, with the Americans. You guys better be careful. And they've started attacking the Afghan National Army. That, he says, is the main thing going on right now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:52.52" data-timestamp="772.52">Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:12:54.52" data-timestamp="774.52">There might be a chance to get interesting audio there, too, that this might be of interest. So let's see. Let's see.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:02.33" data-timestamp="782.33">So they went to see, in an ancient Toyota Corolla. They drove up there. They'd have to be careful, stay under the radar. A few days before, Hyder said, a few guys with the Afghan National Army were stopped on the road coming from Kunar and killed.</p><p begin="00:13:14.55" data-timestamp="794.55">They left on Tuesday. They were going to be back Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Our plan was to talk again 6 o'clock Wednesday night, Kabul time.</p><p begin="00:13:22.08" data-timestamp="802.08">Then, Wednesday, Hyder wasn't answering any emails or any phone calls. 6 o'clock came and went. I started to get worried. And then, after an hour or so, I saw that he was online, on Skype. So I tried him.</p><p begin="00:13:34.17" data-timestamp="814.17">[RING]</p><p begin="00:13:35.14" data-timestamp="815.14">[SKYPE CALL STARTING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:13:38.99" data-timestamp="818.99">Hello?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:40.07" data-timestamp="820.07">Hyder?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:13:41.18" data-timestamp="821.18">Hey, Ira.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:43.04" data-timestamp="823.04">So it's Wednesday, and you just got back from Kunar Province.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:13:47.73" data-timestamp="827.73">Yes, I did. I just got back from Kunar. This was probably the most intense experience of my life a few hours ago. So that's kind of at the forefront of my mind.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:00.33" data-timestamp="840.33">What happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:14:02.39" data-timestamp="842.39">I was coming back with a story. And I was very excited, driving down, taking in the view of Kunar, which is actually very scenic. So I had my headphones on. And I'm driving down.</p><p begin="00:14:15.58" data-timestamp="855.58">And I have Josef, who lives with me now and works with me. And Sartor, who you've been introduced to through the previous documentaries, was sitting in the back. And I wanted to drive myself.</p><p begin="00:14:27.64" data-timestamp="867.64">And we were coming by this bend in the road where it slows down a little bit. And we were passing by that bend when, all of a sudden, somebody jumped up behind this wall. He jumped up behind the wall, and he tried stopped the car. He put his hand on the car twice, like-- [BANGING] --and yelled, stop.</p><p begin="00:14:48.38" data-timestamp="888.38">And I had my headphones on, so I just looked through the corner of my eye. And I see confusion. And I see Josef next to me, yelling, go go, go! And I looked at him, and he had his AK-47 pointed straight at us.</p><p begin="00:15:01.43" data-timestamp="901.43">When he had his AK-47 pointed straight at us and I saw that, I just floored the accelerator. I floored the accelerator, and I was like, oh, not time to stop. And my music was still going on in my ears.</p><p begin="00:15:11.77" data-timestamp="911.77">And then, all of a sudden, I just see firing. And they had a few men on that side of the road firing at our car, and then a few men on the other side of the road, as well, too, firing at our car. They're just emptying into our car.</p><p begin="00:15:27.15" data-timestamp="927.15">Josef is ducked down. Sartor is ducked down in the back. I had my head up, because I have to look at the road. Here, the tires go flat. They hit both tires. And as they hit both tires, I'm kind of looking up and trying to still make it. We're probably going a few hundred meters past them now.</p><p begin="00:15:43.83" data-timestamp="943.83">And then, all of a sudden, I see another person jump out. And he had an RPG in his hand. And he's looking right at me, and I'm looking right at him. And he shot the RPG right at me. He shot the RPG at me.</p><p begin="00:15:56.61" data-timestamp="956.61">And I'm seeing this rocket come towards me, and I'm like, OK, it's fine. I've done enough here. I had a pretty fun life. Obviously, all of that went through my mind. I was like, OK, it's done. It's done. I'm done.</p><p begin="00:16:11.88" data-timestamp="971.88">And the RPG-- this is why everybody was so shocked. So at that second, we hit like a little bump on the road. And the RPG goes straight through the engine of my car, instead of coming directly at me. So it hits the engine right in front of me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:27.43" data-timestamp="987.43">And is the car on fire? Are you in danger of the car blowing up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:16:30.32" data-timestamp="990.32">[INAUDIBLE] the engine on fire at this point. [INAUDIBLE] being able to take a picture later on. I could probably email this to you later on. But I'm going to show you on webcam real quick. You might be able to get a sense of how damaged it was and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:46.45" data-timestamp="1006.45">OK. All right, you're holding this up to the webcam. We're talking over Skype.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:16:50.22" data-timestamp="1010.22">Yeah. Can you see the car?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:52.86" data-timestamp="1012.86">Oh my god. So the whole front is dented in. And then is the windshield busted in? It's hard to see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:16:58.65" data-timestamp="1018.65">Everything's busted in. The whole car went on fire. Do you see that hole right there?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:02.73" data-timestamp="1022.73">Yeah. So there's a huge hole in the driver's side in the front, on the hood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:17:09.67" data-timestamp="1029.67">[INAUDIBLE] right now. Yeah, that's where the RPG went through. And you're looking at it in reverse right now, I think, because of the cam. But that's basically where I was sitting, right above it.</p><p begin="00:17:19.25" data-timestamp="1039.25">And that's where the RPG came through. And that's where I missed the bump of the RPG. I mean, he was aiming straight at me. Like I said, when I saw that RPG come at me, I thought it was done. So--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:32.12" data-timestamp="1052.12">So the car is on fire. You guys are in the car. These guys are shooting just a couple of hundred meters behind you. And maybe have they stopped at that point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:17:41.80" data-timestamp="1061.8">So at this point, it's quiet for a second. We're all kind of looking around. Right then, these two pickup trucks of ANA soldiers are driving by on the opposite side, going in their direction.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:54.12" data-timestamp="1074.12">This is the Afghan army. This is friendly to you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:17:56.49" data-timestamp="1076.49">The Afghan National Army, yeah. So we see the Afghan National Army, two pickup trucks, plenty of guys in there. So we're like, OK-- phew-- coast clear. The ANA's going to be able to take care of this. And we get kind of relieved for a second.</p><p begin="00:18:10.43" data-timestamp="1090.43">We get out of the car, we just see the ANA drive off. They saw it. They saw our car on fire. They definitely heard the RPG his us, because that doesn't make low noise.</p><p begin="00:18:20.39" data-timestamp="1100.39">They heard the gunfire. And they just drive off. They just drive off, and I'm like, OK. All right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:28.32" data-timestamp="1108.32">They drive off in the direction of the guys who are shooting at you, or just in some other direction?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:18:32.18" data-timestamp="1112.18">No, past them. Past them. Past them. They were driving in that direction, and they kept driving. So at this point, Josef just runs off. Josef has run off. He's a good hundred meters away from us at this point.</p><p begin="00:18:44.48" data-timestamp="1124.48">And me and Sartor are kind of just looking at the car on fire, and we're like, what the hell? And we're looking at it, and Josef's screaming, get the hell out of here! Get the hell out of here!</p><p begin="00:18:54.56" data-timestamp="1134.56">And I just looked at Sartor, and I was like, dude, my laptop bag's in there. Everything's in there. So we both run in. We open the door to go inside to grab the laptop bag out of it, with my laptop and other stuff in there.</p><p begin="00:19:08.83" data-timestamp="1148.83">And so as we do that, they start firing again. Luckily, the car covered us. And the bullets just hit the back of the car as we were on the side of the car trying to get the laptop bag out. We managed to get the laptop bag out. And then I'm kind of hiding behind the car.</p><p begin="00:19:24.38" data-timestamp="1164.38">I take out my iPhone, because I'm like, OK, I've got to record this a little bit, at least, for you guys. I was like, I want to record this thing. This is an interesting thing. I look at my iPhone. It has, like, 1% battery, 2%. I'm like, [BLEEP].</p><p begin="00:19:36.52" data-timestamp="1176.52">So I have this on record, and I see Josef just come running back down. And it was kind of funny. He's like, what are you doing? I'm like, I need to record the car, I need to record the car for the thing. Remember, we came here to do the radio thing.</p><p begin="00:19:48.14" data-timestamp="1188.14">And he cursed you guys out and punched the hood. And basically, he said, F <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> What the hell are you going to do with <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> when you're dead? And he started dragging me away.</p><p begin="00:20:02.39" data-timestamp="1202.39">And right then, the phone turned off too. The phone turned off too, so it didn't save the recording, either. And he's dragging me away. As he's dragging me away--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:09.56" data-timestamp="1209.56">OK, soon after this in the conversation, I let Hyder know that if he is ever again in any situation where he might get killed, it is OK if he runs away and stops recording for the radio show. So he explained that they went around the bend. They saw two civilian cars stopped there. They were still being shot at. So they got into those cars. They got away.</p><p begin="00:20:27.78" data-timestamp="1227.78">This was the first time, Hyder said, that somebody specifically tried to kill him. And he thinks that they wanted him because they were letting other cars pass by on the road, and they specifically tried to stop his car. But who was it who was targeting him? And why were they targeting him? That wasn't clear to him at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:20:45.17" data-timestamp="1245.17">That's something I'm going to have to think about and figure out tonight, in the next couple of days.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:53.22" data-timestamp="1253.22">Well, what are the possibilities? List through right now, tick off a couple of possibilities, just so I understand. What could it be?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:21:02.23" data-timestamp="1262.23">It could have been the Taliban. It could have been the Taliban, who might have been following me a lot more closely than I realized, following my locations, where I'm spending the night, where I'm living. They definitely knew exactly where I was. I can't think of anything personal, in terms of any personal feuds, et cetera. So it'd be most likely the Taliban or people in Kunal that are with the insurgency that don't see me, I guess, as a threat.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:39.69" data-timestamp="1299.69">And Hyder, is it as simple as you and your dad aren't necessarily so crazy about the current government in Afghanistan, but they know you definitely do not like the Taliban? And is it as simple as that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:21:53.55" data-timestamp="1313.55">Almost as simple as that. The one thing I would add onto that is they could see us as being even more of a threat because we're not that close to this government anymore, because we don't approve of many things that are going on in the government. They can sideline a lot of other people very easily by saying, oh, these guys are corrupted individuals, involved with the government, fattening their pockets. But when they see me driving around in a [BLEEP] Corolla and just talking to people, engaging them, and being pretty sincere in my efforts, that's seen as much more of a threat, because they could delegitimize the Afghan government and the officials involved with them much easier.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:34.37" data-timestamp="1354.37">And it's not crazy to think that Hyder is now at a point where he would be worth killing. His family's from Kunar. His father and uncle were in the insurgency in Kunar that drove out the Soviets in the 1980s. When the current Afghan government came to power after September 11, Hyder's dad was appointed governor of Kunar. They have friends there. They have a base of support.</p><p begin="00:22:53.24" data-timestamp="1373.24">And as the Americans pull out in the next two years, there's going to be a power vacuum in the country. And people are getting in position for that, including Hyder. He is setting himself up to do politics. The way that he explains it, he says he wants to be the Afghan equivalent of a congressman, though with a militia. You need a militia, because it's Afghanistan.</p><p begin="00:23:11.59" data-timestamp="1391.59">We talked for a while. Hyder insisted that he is planning on going back to Kunar soon. And he's going to do it just like he did this time, in another beat-up old car, to prove that they didn't scare him, to prove that he wasn't going to stay away, which I really hope that his mom and his dad and his uncle talk him out of. And then we finally got to the reason for his trip in the first place, the story that he was so excited to bring back, that he ended up risking his life for, of what was happening in the province.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:40.83" data-timestamp="1420.83">So just review the highlights for me. So let's talk about what you saw when you were there. What's interesting?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:23:45.67" data-timestamp="1425.67">OK, so we drove up there. We drove up there yesterday. And we went into the Pesh Valley.</p><p begin="00:23:56.49" data-timestamp="1436.49">It's actually kind of funny. So the Pesh Valley's sort of like the valley of death. It was the place that was considered very dangerous. And some interesting new dynamics have emerged there with the ANA, the Afghan National Army.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:11.24" data-timestamp="1451.24">Again, this is the government's army. This for the government of Afghanistan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:24:14.75" data-timestamp="1454.75">The ANA, the Afghan National Army, is in control there now. The Americans have pulled out. What's going on because of that is that a lot of people, especially the civilian population, is siding with the ANA now. The ANA is just culturally much more aware. They've been able to make inroads amongst the population.</p><p begin="00:24:36.34" data-timestamp="1476.34">They've been able to push the Taliban out, especially from the main roads. I was driving by areas where people used to get stopped and beheaded, government officials or those considered working with the Americans, driving past all of these potholes in the road where they had laid down IEDs. And that was fine. It was fine. And we're all taking in the scenery.</p><p begin="00:25:01.14" data-timestamp="1501.14">And it was a very heartwarming story, actually. I was actually very excited to come back. I was kind of aware, I was like, OK, maybe good news is not always that fun to report about. I was like, but it'll be exciting to finally come back. And I was very hopeful and feeling pretty jolly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:22.87" data-timestamp="1522.87">Because it was so hopeful that the Afghan National Army was doing a decent job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:25:26.74" data-timestamp="1526.74">Exactly. Exactly, that there's hope for this country, there's hope for security in this country, there's hope for stability in this country. And as somebody who has spent the last 10 years involved in this place, that was incredible news for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:44.27" data-timestamp="1544.27">Hyder Akbar. He's the author of the book <i>Come</i> <i>Back</i> <i>to</i> <i>Afghanistan.</i> This song that's playing right now is one that he swears was playing on his iPod when he was ambushed.

<h3>Act Two: Tucson, Arizona</h3>

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:20.89" data-timestamp="1580.89">Well, if you live in a part of the country that has already had snow this year, you may find it hard to relate to the thrill experienced by some people in Arizona this past week. Lisa Pollak explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:26:31.37" data-timestamp="1591.37">When I heard that an outdoor mall in Tuscon was promising snow on Saturday, a day when the high temperature hit 77 degrees, I figured there were only two possible explanations-- a pre-Christmas meteorological miracle or a ski resort style snow machine. But there was, in fact, a third option. I heard about it from Melanie Sutton, the senior marketing manager at La Encantada mall, the mall that sponsors the annual event known as the Enchanted Snowfall. She said that what we were about to see falling from sky that night was a desert style snow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melanie Sutton</h4><p begin="00:27:01.56" data-timestamp="1621.56">As our tagline, we say, "98% magic, 2% soap."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:27:05.64" data-timestamp="1625.64">Oh, wow.

The ingredient is soap. But they're shaped as snowflakes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:27:17.19" data-timestamp="1637.19">Got that? Me, neither. But minutes later, along with hundreds of parents and kids in the mall's open-air courtyard, I had a chance to see it for myself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad 1</h4><p begin="00:27:25.80" data-timestamp="1645.8">Oh, oh, here we go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:27:26.91" data-timestamp="1646.91">"Oh, oh, here we go," I heard one of the dads say.

Up close, though, it was hard to be fooled. Imagine little clumps of bath suds or globs of latte foam, with a faintly fresh smell.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad 2</h4><p begin="00:27:53.19" data-timestamp="1673.19">There it is, look!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:27:54.65" data-timestamp="1674.65">This man is talking to his three-year-old son, Cameron, who at first seemed to be saying how much he liked the snow--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cameron</h4><p begin="00:27:59.70" data-timestamp="1679.7">I don't like snow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad 2</h4><p begin="00:28:01.16" data-timestamp="1681.16">You like snow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:28:02.63" data-timestamp="1682.63">--but on closer examination, was actually saying how much he didn't like the snow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cameron</h4><p begin="00:28:06.73" data-timestamp="1686.73">Don't like snow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad 2</h4><p begin="00:28:08.21" data-timestamp="1688.21">It's OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cameron</h4><p begin="00:28:09.20" data-timestamp="1689.2">I don't like snow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad 2</h4><p begin="00:28:11.18" data-timestamp="1691.18">It's OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:28:13.17" data-timestamp="1693.17">Cameron was the exception. All around me, kids seemed to be going insane with joy. Over by the Apple store, a group of them had planted themselves under one of the faux snow machines and seemed to be trying to get as much white foam on their hair and clothes as possible. Others ran around with outstretched hands, trying to catch enough to make mushy snowballs and smash it on each other's heads.</p><p begin="00:28:31.80" data-timestamp="1711.8">[CHILD LAUGHING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child 2</h4><p begin="00:28:32.71" data-timestamp="1712.71">My hair!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:28:34.98" data-timestamp="1714.98">One boy walked up to me with a mass of suds in each hand and a look on his face like he couldn't believe his good fortune.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 1</h4><p begin="00:28:40.08" data-timestamp="1720.08">Look at how much snow I have.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:28:42.75" data-timestamp="1722.75">Suddenly I felt a sense of duty.

<h3>Act Three: Washington, D.C.</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:20.12" data-timestamp="1820.12">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. This week, instead of the usual sort of theme we do on our show, our theme is just the seven days that have just passed. We have stories, small and personal, and big and national, and international.</p><p begin="00:30:31.54" data-timestamp="1831.54">Monday, you probably heard, House Speaker John Boehner issued his counterproposal to avoid the fiscal cliff. It was promptly rejected by the White House. By Wednesday, there were front-page stories that Republican leaders are considering a fallback plan to extend tax cuts to the middle class now, fight about the rest of it in January or February.</p><p begin="00:30:49.20" data-timestamp="1849.2">Also this week, Boehner cracked the whip in his own party. Republicans who didn't vote his way lost committee assignments. He warned to other House members that he would be watching. To put all of this in perspective, I called veteran Congress-watcher Norman Ornstein, who happened to be in Prague when I phoned him. His official title is Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:31:08.49" data-timestamp="1868.49">But all I care about is that you mention the book--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:11.03" data-timestamp="1871.03">And the title of the book is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:31:12.31" data-timestamp="1872.31">--which is, <i>It's</i> <i>Even</i> <i>Worse</i> <i>Than</i> <i>It</i> <i>Looks--</i> <i>How</i> <i>the</i> <i>American</i> <i>Constitutional</i> <i>System</i> <i>Collided</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i> <i>New</i> <i>Politics</i> <i>of</i> <i>Extremism.</i></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:20.63" data-timestamp="1880.63">Consider it mentioned.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:31:22.01" data-timestamp="1882.01">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:23.02" data-timestamp="1883.02">So you're in Prague this week. Isn't this kind of a big week not to be near Capitol Hill for somebody like you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:31:28.39" data-timestamp="1888.39">It's a good week to be away from Capitol Hill in a lot of ways.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:32.04" data-timestamp="1892.04">How so?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:31:33.40" data-timestamp="1893.4">Well, it seems like a big week. But the fact is we're in the middle of an end game. And I've been kind of bemused by all of the focus on the every-minute maneuvering of Speaker John Boehner and President Obama, including a heavy focus on the fact that Boehner didn't pose for a picture with the President at the White House Christmas party.</p><p begin="00:32:01.51" data-timestamp="1921.51">And there's one important principle to keep in mind. When does an end game end? At the end. And the end is not this week.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:11.16" data-timestamp="1931.16">Are you basically saying that this is a week we might as well ignore the news from Capitol Hill?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:32:15.73" data-timestamp="1935.73">Yes. I'm saying that there are naturally going to be people who follow every little twist and turn. But it doesn't really matter.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:25.05" data-timestamp="1945.05">So this is the thing that I was wondering, is, when you look at this maneuvering, can you tell how it's going to play out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Ornstein</h4><p begin="00:32:32.02" data-timestamp="1952.02">The answer is two-fold. The first part is, no, you can't tell how it's going to play out. But all of these ploys and, in some ways, histrionics are par for the course. So taking the temperature on any one of them doesn't really tell us that much.</p><p begin="00:32:50.96" data-timestamp="1970.96">Now, what I would have to say, though, is the second point. And it's frankly a giant caveat here. We are going through the most dysfunctional politics I've seen in 43 years. So I think there's a pretty good chance we'll get a patchwork deal to get us past this dilemma before the end of the year.</p><p begin="00:33:11.89" data-timestamp="1991.89">But I also think that there's a substantial chance, much higher than it would have been if we were looking at the process 20 years ago or 10 years ago, even 5 years ago, that we'll slip over into January. And it might take a jolt, a serious jolt, from the markets to bring us to some kind of conclusion here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:33.03" data-timestamp="2013.03">Norman Ornstein. I asked him, why do they even bother going through the theater this week? Why not just skip to the part where they actually hammer out the deal? His answer, I thought, was interesting.</p><p begin="00:33:42.76" data-timestamp="2022.76">He said that the Republicans need to demonstrate to Grover Norquist and Rush Limbaugh and all their own constituents that they tried everything, their back is against the wall, there was no other choice before they can raise taxes. The Democrats have their own version of it. They have to demonstrate to their base they had no choice but to cut entitlements before any deal. Both sides need to say no, he says, for a while.</p></div> </div>

So NO/AIDS tries to make finding at your HIV status as convenient as they possibly can, which means, for them, going into bars, asking people to put down their drink for 15 minutes, and come get tested.

And thinking about that, we sent out a writer, Nathaniel Rich, to watch the HIV testing at one of the highest risk venues NO/AIDS tests at-- Club New Orleans, a five-story sex club for men in the center of the French Quarter, which means that this story might not be appropriate for all children or maybe any of them. It acknowledges the existence of sex. Here's Nathaniel. We changed the name of the guy he's writing about in this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nathaniel Rich</h4><p begin="00:36:20.60" data-timestamp="2180.6">Room 300 was the largest bedroom in the club, just large enough to fit a chair and a queen size bed covered with red satin sheets. Sitting cross-legged on the bed was Alex Lee, a 25-year-old counselor for NO/AIDS, who's also a student at the University of New Orleans. He's majoring in anthropology. In fact, he had a final exam the next morning.</p><p begin="00:36:41.09" data-timestamp="2201.09">When Mark entered the room, Alex was reading an essay about Occam's razor. Alex asked Mark to sit in the chair. He explained that the HIV test would only detect an infection that occurred more than three months ago. He showed Mark how to use an applicator to swab this mouth-- first his upper gums, then his lower gums. When Mark was finished, he dipped the end of the applicator into a small vial.</p><p begin="00:37:03.38" data-timestamp="2223.38">Alex set a timer to 20 minutes, the time it takes for a test result to appear, and placed it on the bedside table between them. He asked Mark a series of questions. "When was your last test?" "About a year ago," said Mark, "at a bar, in fact."</p><p begin="00:37:19.96" data-timestamp="2239.96">"In the past 12 months," asked Alex, "have you had anal sex with a man?" "Yes," said Mark. "Have you had sex without using a condom?" "As a giver," said Mark. "How about sex with an anonymous, casual, or internet partner, someone you didn't know too well?" "I'm sure I have," said Mark.</p><p begin="00:37:39.21" data-timestamp="2259.21">He seemed to become increasingly anxious. He crossed his arms, holding his elbows, hugging his chest. "Have you knowingly had sex with someone who's living with HIV?" "No." "Have you injected any drugs?" "No."</p><p begin="00:37:52.81" data-timestamp="2272.81">"Have you had sex with someone who injects drugs?" Mark paused for two seconds. "No," he said. Alex started the next question, but Mark interrupted him. "Yes," he said, "yes, I have." "Sex with someone who injects drugs?" "Yeah. I just didn't know it until after."</p><p begin="00:38:13.60" data-timestamp="2293.6">The timer beeped. "Does that mean it's ready?" asked Mark. "No," said Alex. "It just beeps sometimes."</p><p begin="00:38:24.02" data-timestamp="2304.02">"It's so funny," said Mark, "and this is so crude, but I did have intercourse last night, not wearing a condom. It's just weird. The guy told me he was negative, but for some reason, after all was said and done, I thought he was really positive. And then I was thinking on the walk home how stupid that was."</p><p begin="00:38:42.05" data-timestamp="2322.05">Mark had been busy all day at work, so it had been easy to avoid thinking about it. But that evening, he went for a walk and soon found himself standing in front of the club. It was odd, Mark said, because he hadn't visited the club for a year. As soon as he stepped inside, a voice came on the loudspeaker announcing that there would be free HIV testing that evening. Suddenly, Mark understood why he had come to the club, and he felt scared.</p><p begin="00:39:06.60" data-timestamp="2346.6">There were five minutes left on the timer. "I'm really anxious," said Mark. He looked it. He was jittery. He rose from his chair. He said he was going to walk around and come back when his result was ready.</p><p begin="00:39:28.59" data-timestamp="2368.59">But five minutes later, when the timer went off, Mark was gone. Alex waited another 10 minutes, then another 10. A different man was tested, waited for his result, then left. Still no sign of Mark.</p><p begin="00:39:43.84" data-timestamp="2383.84">Alex was mystified. In his two years testing men at bars, nobody had ever fled before finding out his results. It was now almost 11:30. His shift had official ended half an hour ago, and his anthropology final was at 10:00 AM.</p><p begin="00:39:58.05" data-timestamp="2398.05">As Alex gathered his testing materials, his colleague, Brandon, decided to make one final effort to find Mark. Brandon started in the gym. Mark wasn't there. Nor was Mark in the sauna or the whirlpool.</p><p begin="00:40:11.57" data-timestamp="2411.57">He was not in the room called the Bookstore, which doesn't have any books, nor was he in the Barracks. He was not in the so-called Porno Room, in which every surface is made of black rubber. And he was not in the Dungeon.</p><p begin="00:40:23.14" data-timestamp="2423.14">Brandon paced through the narrow hallways, which are lined with more than 50 tiny bedrooms. Some of the doors were ajar. He saw harnesses and swings. He saw men watching videos.</p><p begin="00:40:34.00" data-timestamp="2434">And then, in another bedroom, Brandon saw Mark. He was sitting on a bed, talking with a naked man. "Oh," said Mark, "are you looking for me?"</p><p begin="00:40:48.47" data-timestamp="2448.47">Five minutes later, Mark returned to room 300. His fingers were trembling. He was too nervous to sit. Alex told him that his test had come back negative.</p><p begin="00:40:58.19" data-timestamp="2458.19">"Yay!" Mark shouted. He was ecstatic. He asked Alex to show him the result on the test form. "God, I'm so happy. Thank you. Oh my god."</p><p begin="00:41:08.35" data-timestamp="2468.35">He thanked Alex a few more times and said he was grateful for the work that NO/AIIDS was doing. Mark even said he wanted to volunteer for the organization, that he felt, as a member of the New Orleans gay community, it was the right thing to do. Then, negative test results in hand, he disappeared into the club.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:33.09" data-timestamp="2493.09">Nathaniel Rich.

<h3>Act Five: Cairo, Egypt</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:10.73" data-timestamp="2530.73">A week can be a long time, when every day seems to shift the direction of your entire country. Egypt has had a week of demonstrations, counter demonstrations, and violence. The demonstrations are for and against the country's president, Mohammed Morsi.</p><p begin="00:42:24.67" data-timestamp="2544.67">And OK, quick review-- Morsi was democratically elected a couple months ago. But at the end of November, he shocked many Egyptians by issuing a decree giving himself enormous powers, basically putting all his decisions, past and present, above the law. He said he had to do this because judges appointed by Egypt's ousted dictator, Hosni Mubarak, were undermining him. Some of those judges had dissolved Egypt's newly elected parliament right before Morsi took office.</p><p begin="00:42:49.78" data-timestamp="2569.78">So now, if you follow the news at all, you've seen this-- both sides are dug in, each convinced that they represent true democracy in Egypt. There are a lot of ways for things to get worse, very few for them to get better. Nancy Updike reports on what has happened and how some of the anger is being spread around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:43:06.85" data-timestamp="2586.85">Up until this past Wednesday, opponents and supporters of President Morsi had held their rallies in different places-- on purpose, to avoid confrontations. But late in the day on Wednesday, supporters of President Morsi, members of the Muslim Brotherhood, marched to the presidential palace, where some anti-Morsi protesters were camped out. And after that, all night long, people fought or ran or hid.</p><p begin="00:43:29.26" data-timestamp="2609.26">By Thursday morning, seven people were dead, and hundreds were injured. And four of Morsi's advisers had resigned in protest. As of right now, Friday evening, around 6:00 PM Egypt time, the leaders of both sides aren't talking to each other, and protesters are still in the streets, separate and peaceful for the moment.</p><p begin="00:43:47.02" data-timestamp="2627.02">When I was in Cairo after Mubarak was ousted last year, I saw a scene that now seems impossible-- writers and editors, secular Egyptians, who were talking over croissants with members of a formerly violent Islamist group named Gamaa Islamiya, an ally of the Muslim Brotherhood. The secular men and the devout men weren't becoming friends. But they weren't beating each other up in the streets, either.</p><p begin="00:44:09.19" data-timestamp="2649.19">[PHONE RINGING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yusuf Al-qaid</h4><p begin="00:44:09.63" data-timestamp="2649.63">Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:44:10.95" data-timestamp="2650.95">[SPEAKING ARABIC].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:44:12.51" data-timestamp="2652.51">On Thursday night, I made a phone call through an interpreter. She was shouting a bit to make herself heard. And we called one of the people from that meeting, an Egyptian novelist in his 70s named Yusuf al-Qaid to find out his take on the week's events. He remembered me, but he wanted to make absolutely sure I knew where he stands in this fight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yusuf Al-qaid</h4><p begin="00:44:31.12" data-timestamp="2671.12">[SPEAKING ARABIC].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:44:32.90" data-timestamp="2672.9">I would like our American journalist here to understand that I am not in any neutral position here. I am with a civilian modern state. I am against a religious state. I am against any rule based on religion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:44:59.21" data-timestamp="2699.21">So against Morsi. And since he brought up the fact that I'm American, I told al-Qaid that I'd seen pictures of anti-Morsi protesters, people like him, carrying signs talking about the US and President Obama. I didn't mention this specific one to him, but I saw a sign that said, "Obama, your bitch is our dictator." The vehemence of al-Qaid's response caught me by surprise.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:45:22.84" data-timestamp="2722.84">In my view, the biggest betrayal that has taken place against the Egyptian people is the absolute support that the American administration has given to the Muslim Brotherhood. America is ignoring the violence that is conducted against the Egyptian people. America is completely silent and has voiced that its relationship with Egypt is strategic. And therefore, passing events do not affect this strategic relationship.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:46:11.20" data-timestamp="2771.2">By strategic relationship, he means that the United States is more concerned about Egypt's dealings with Israel than about Egypt's dealings with its own citizens. This week, more than ever, I realized that no matter how angry and caught up in their own national issues a person is, depending on what country they're in, they probably still have plenty of anger left over for the United States.</p><p begin="00:46:32.80" data-timestamp="2792.8">After I hung up with al-Qaid, I called another person I met in Cairo last year-- completely different guy, a religious man, young, 28 years old, named Mohammed Agiba. Mohammed spent years in the Muslim Brotherhood. But now he's marching against Morsi too. He knew Morsi's power grab would divide the country. And he thinks the proposed constitution is a disaster that has to be stopped.</p><p begin="00:46:55.83" data-timestamp="2815.83">And talking about the constitution is when we ended up at the same place I ended up with al-Qaid, the secular guy. Mohammed talked about how the constitution calls for a joint civilian military council, weighted toward the military, that has to be consulted before the president can declare a war. The council also has a role in deciding on the military's budget. Mohammed sees the council as one thing only.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohammed Agiba</h4><p begin="00:47:19.31" data-timestamp="2839.31">[SPEAKING ARABIC].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:47:20.67" data-timestamp="2840.67">This is what the US wants; this is what Israel wants-- a regime which appears to be democratic to the people, but actually it is this defense national council which will be doing all the work. This council, the National Defense Council, will be the one ruling the country.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:47:48.49" data-timestamp="2868.49">So are you saying you think President Morsi or part of his government or all of his government are puppets of the United States?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohammed Agiba</h4><p begin="00:47:56.74" data-timestamp="2876.74">[SPEAKING ARABIC].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:47:58.13" data-timestamp="2878.13">For sure President Morsi wants the interests of Egypt. However, he sees the implementation of this interest, or finding the interest, from a very narrow perspective that the United States has set for him. We do not want him to see that perspective through the United States' perspective.</p><p begin="00:48:21.36" data-timestamp="2901.36">We want him to see it through the Egyptian people's vision and through the Egyptian people's perspective. And we say, please, the Egyptian people should be your priority and not the American administration.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:35.81" data-timestamp="2915.81">I asked Mohammed one more question, not about America, but about Egypt and the choices people have faced there since the revolution. I asked him if he'd voted for Morsi. He did, like a lot of people who are now protesting against Morsi.</p><p begin="00:48:49.93" data-timestamp="2929.93">He said he doesn't regret it. The alternative was worse. He says he just hopes Morsi can pull out of this and pull Egypt out too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:06.20" data-timestamp="2946.2">Nancy Updike.
