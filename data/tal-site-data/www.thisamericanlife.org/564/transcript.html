<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.52" data-timestamp="0.52">Jordan did not love the idea of coming into the studio to tell this next story. The very first thing he said to me when he sat down was--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:00:07.94" data-timestamp="7.94">I am curious-- of all the stories, why this story? Because it's not my particularly proudest story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:17.36" data-timestamp="17.36">In fact, the only reason that he agreed to the interview is that he's good friends with the little brother of one of our producers, Miki. They all grew up together. And this story happened when he was going into his senior year of high school in small town Utah. Jordan and his buddies all lived together in a house that summer, daring each other into <i>Jackass</i> style pranks and stunts.</p><p begin="00:00:36.46" data-timestamp="36.46">For instance, there's this time they drove a car into an orchard. There's the bike accident that gave Jordan one huge swollen testicle. There's the time they peed into a 7 Up can, and Miki's mom accidentally drank out of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:00:48.28" data-timestamp="48.28">I'll tell you it was not my pee in the 7 UP can.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:50.62" data-timestamp="50.62">All right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:00:52.23" data-timestamp="52.23">And I feel like to talk on public radio, there's a part of me that would rather tell America at large about my swollen testicles story. But this is the one that I feel I tell the least.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:07.79" data-timestamp="67.79">The story that he tells the least-- the one that he's about to tell you right now-- is about how he did not become Mr. Genola in the Mr. Genola contest. Genola is a farming town, population 1,300. And the contest was a pageant for guys. There was no Miss Genola pageant. And it was a brand new tradition, only in its second year, and it was not a serious contest. Like the winner the first year, for the talent competition, ate a frozen burrito while it was still frozen. Like, that was his talent.</p><p begin="00:01:38.28" data-timestamp="98.28">Jordan's friend, who was also named Jordan, had competed that first year wearing a blow up butterfly float during the swimsuit competition and singing Pearl Jam to his dead frog in the talent section.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:01:48.96" data-timestamp="108.96">And he's deciding that we're going to enter the Mr. Genola content and volunteers me to be the participant, the single participant out of our house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.29" data-timestamp="119.29">And just so you can picture this-- they did have an audience of a couple hundred people, because it was scheduled as part of the annual Genola Day celebration. Which has a rodeo, and a greased pig chase, and a town dinner, and a parade.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:02:11.40" data-timestamp="131.4">And in the middle of a public park, they took a bunch of wood apple bins and flipped them over, and put some plywood across it and made a stage. And then, probably eight contestants, all high schoolers--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl Mc</h4><p begin="00:02:24.41" data-timestamp="144.41">We're honored to be the MCs for the Mr. Genola pageant. We hope you understand this pageant is not a scholarship pageant.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:31.71" data-timestamp="151.71">In the video of this, you can see two teenaged MCs dressed in spoof awards show wear-- a girl in a checkered jacket with a comically wide lapel, and a boy in formal tails and a vest, no shirt at all, bow tie, and cowboy hat. Jordan and I went right to the part where he comes on stage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy Mc</h4><p begin="00:02:49.14" data-timestamp="169.14">Our fifth contestant is Jordan Alberto Riley, son of Alan and Kris Riley. We couldn't find anything special about him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:02:57.04" data-timestamp="177.04">So they just announced me. And you know, it's a small town. They tell me who my parents are. And I come up on the stage, and I'm wearing a shirt with sleeves cut off, and I've got some long hair and a hat. And then I bring up a wheelchair.</p><p begin="00:03:12.47" data-timestamp="192.47">[CROWD CLAMORING]</p><p begin="00:03:14.89" data-timestamp="194.89"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:16.34" data-timestamp="196.34">Jordan had used a wheelchair for a little while after an injury once. Now he starts showing off the tricks he learned then-- popping wheelies and spinning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:03:24.29" data-timestamp="204.29">I just was spinning faster and faster, until me and the wheelchair all spun off to the side, tumbling backwards.</p><p begin="00:03:31.18" data-timestamp="211.18">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:03:35.57" data-timestamp="215.57"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:37.52" data-timestamp="217.52">After a few more wheelies, Jordan gets up from the chair, flexes his muscles. Heavy metal music kicks in.</p><p begin="00:03:43.58" data-timestamp="223.58">[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:03:46.24" data-timestamp="226.24">And his buddies carry an old door onstage, this door that has a big pane of glass in the top third. Jordan grabs the mike to explain what's going to happen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:03:54.36" data-timestamp="234.36">I'm pretty much just breaking a window. That's about it.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:03:59.38" data-timestamp="239.38">Now, I'm pumping myself up by flexing and shaking my head. And I run at it and give it a good punch through the window. And then I stepped back, and I looked at this window, and there was a triangular piece of glass right in the middle of it. And I looked at that, and I thought, that's funny. I don't remember that glass having blood on it before I punched through it. And stepped back, and I'm just looking at the audience, and I looked down-- down right at my forearm, like almost to my elbow. And there was a hole. And like, in that moment in time, it was like when things go in slow motion.</p><p begin="00:04:45.37" data-timestamp="285.37">I remember a severed muscle hanging out. And I'm looking at my forearm, and I think about this time that we went hiking in the Narrows of Zion's national park. And I was carrying a Rambo knife, and I went to go catch a snake. And I cut the side of this snake in his-- you can see some stuff coming out this gash, which I immediately regretted. But I stood there, and I thought about that snake as I looked at my forearm.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:23.35" data-timestamp="323.35">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:05:25.36" data-timestamp="325.36">And then it seemed like, bam! Fast motion happens. And I turn around, and blood is just splatting on the floor. And the MC steps in. And I'm showing her my arm, and I'm saying, call an ambulance! And she says, is that real?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:46.93" data-timestamp="346.93">Oh, she thought it was a prank. She thought you were just like-- you have fake blood or something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jordan Riley</h4><p begin="00:05:51.10" data-timestamp="351.1">Oh, totally. Everybody did. And then one of my friends tears off his t-shirt and then tourniquets around it. They're like, he's turning white. He's turning white. Just lay him down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:05.08" data-timestamp="365.08">Kids start rushing the stage to see. We actually talked to one of those kids, who's grown now. And he said that he figured it was fake blood and a really cool prank. And then he got near and saw that it was real. And the next thing he knew, he was waking up under a tree with an oxygen mask. Jordan and his friends believe a few people fainted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl Mc</h4><p begin="00:06:23.87" data-timestamp="383.87">Ladies and gentlemen, we're getting as cleaned up as soon as we can. Please, that happened totally on accident. I didn't know he was doing that, and we probably wouldn't have allowed it. So for the judges' information, we're going to have Mike Huell go before Clark Davis, because Mike's singing and Clark's dancing. So we can let the stage dry for a minute.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:45.70" data-timestamp="405.7">Jordan says that this girl MC, later, said how mad she was that he ruined her pageant. But at this moment, she and the other teenaged MC had to ad-lib their way through this situation that I think even a very experienced public speaker would find challenging. There's a man on stage with them mopping up blood-- like with a mop, there's so much blood. And they have to fill time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy Mc</h4><p begin="00:07:08.50" data-timestamp="428.5">All right. Um, well, how's the show so far?</p><p begin="00:07:12.82" data-timestamp="432.82">[LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]</p><p begin="00:07:16.32" data-timestamp="436.32"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:18.82" data-timestamp="438.82">That goes over surprisingly well. And so to stall for time, they run through what apparently is the only standby material they have. The boy onstage pulls out a fistful of pages.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy Mc</h4><p begin="00:07:28.25" data-timestamp="448.25">All right. Here's something a man named John put on his answering machine. It says, hi, this is John. If you are the phone company, I already sent the money. If you are my parents, please send money. If you are my friends, you owe me money. If you are a female, don't worry. I have plenty of money.</p><p begin="00:07:49.18" data-timestamp="469.18">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:07:52.07" data-timestamp="472.07"></p><p begin="00:07:53.99" data-timestamp="473.99">Here's another one. Hi, I am probably home. I just-- I'm just--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:59.28" data-timestamp="479.28">They never did another Mr. Genola contest. This pretty much killed it off. The ambulance came. Jordan didn't lose an arm. He's fine. He's in his 30s now. And the phrase that he uses for what he's become now is "contributing member of society." He settled down. He's a farmer-- grows apples, cherries, peaches-- with a family, a young daughter. He hasn't lived in Genola since that summer.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:59.43" data-timestamp="599.43">So Jordan's story was about a prank gone wrong. And you say this next story is like that, too. Except, in this next story, it is not just one prank. And "wrong" does not capture the sheer wrongness of what you're about to hear. Nancy Updike tells the story.</p><p begin="00:10:17.34" data-timestamp="617.34"></p><p begin="00:10:17.78" data-timestamp="617.78">And I should say, before we start-- if you're listening to this on our podcast or online, we have unbeeped some curse words in the internet version of this story. If you want to listen with your kids in the car, or you just don't like curse words, there's a beeped version available at our website, thisamericanlife.org. OK. Here's Nancy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:36.06" data-timestamp="636.06">Harmon Leon is a writer and comedian whose cocktail party story about "the weirdest gig I ever did" is a more weird, by a lot, than anyone else's that I've heard. He answered an ad for a job several years ago that called for a comedian who would be the hilarious sidekick to a celebrity on a new, hidden camera prank TV show.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:10:57.37" data-timestamp="657.37">It was on the Los Angeles Craigslist ad. And I'm thinking, oh, it's a celebrity hidden camera show. I've done a bunch of prank stuff. So I sent him my prank reel. I got the job, and they said they couldn't disclose who the celebrity was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:11.51" data-timestamp="671.51">Harmon rolled his eyes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:11:12.81" data-timestamp="672.81">Well, just people say that as like, oh, when we tell you who the celebrity is, you're not going to believe it. You're not going to believe it. And your mind just goes, you know, you're jaded--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:22.22" data-timestamp="682.22">Eh, I'll probably believe it, you think.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:11:23.57" data-timestamp="683.57">Yeah, yeah. It's like, is it like the other Hilton sister? Or is it Vanilla Ice? My bar was so low to what it actually turned out to be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:33.39" data-timestamp="693.39">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:11:34.99" data-timestamp="694.99">And they go, OK, are you ready?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:38.70" data-timestamp="698.7">Are you ready? Because it's O.J. Simpson. A prank show with O.J. Simpson. Harmon thought, that's a terrible idea for a TV show, and I'm definitely taking this job.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:11:52.87" data-timestamp="712.87">So the shooting was in a week. So I drove down from San Francisco to LA. I get out of my car. I go to the production office. And the first thing the producer says to me-- "you know, Harmon, we really can't mention the murders."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:12:11.60" data-timestamp="731.6">OK. Anyone over 30, please bear with me for a minute. And for the under 30s, here's the O.J. Simpson recap. Handsome, charming, famous football player, Heisman Trophy winner whose nickname was "Juice." After he retired, became even more famous doing commercials, <i>Monday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Football</i>, movies, TV shows, <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Live</i>.</p><p begin="00:12:30.90" data-timestamp="750.9">And here's the part you probably do know, even if you think you know nothing. In 1994, he was accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson and another person, Ron Goldman. You know that because he became a national obsession. 95 million people, give or take, watched the live broadcast of his white Bronco driving the LA freeways with police cars chasing him. That was more than the Superbowl audience that year. 150 million watched the verdict in the trial where he was acquitted of the murders.</p><p begin="00:13:03.65" data-timestamp="783.65">This prank show was being filmed about 10 years after that. O.J. Simpson had been mostly out of the public eye for those years. Most Americans at that time, 78%, believed he either probably or definitely killed his ex-wife and Ron Goldman. He lost a civil suit that had found them liable for the deaths. And so--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:13:24.96" data-timestamp="804.96">This would be the next step in his career-- doing a zany, hidden camera prank show entitled <i>Juiced.</i></p><p begin="00:13:32.73" data-timestamp="812.73">["JUICED" THEME SONG]</p><p begin="00:13:34.18" data-timestamp="814.18"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:36.08" data-timestamp="816.08">Incredibly, this exists. It was a one-time special on Pay Per View. Just one episode, about an hour long. And I've got the DVD on my desk right now. Here's the description on the cover. Quote, "witness O.J. Simpson performing hilarious practical jokes and shocking hidden camera stunts on unsuspecting real life people all across America. No one is safe, because the juice is loose again."</p><p begin="00:14:04.61" data-timestamp="844.61">My first question when I saw it was, why does this exist? Which is a dumb question. Reality shows exist because they're cheap to make and people watch them. Maybe a better question is, why isn't this hidden camera prank show from 2006 as well known and scrutinized as every other part of O.J. Simpson's public life? I'm here to say, I think it's worth a look.</p><p begin="00:14:30.20" data-timestamp="870.2">Here's a show that was never meant to be taken seriously. And because of that, we get these strange, revealing glimpses of O.J. Goofing around in front of the camera, chatting with strangers, riffing. It's an hour with him unlike any hour you've ever seen. I also think it might be the most mystifying celebrity comeback vehicle ever made.</p><p begin="00:15:01.99" data-timestamp="901.99">The show is a whole bunch of short prank scenarios, one after another, in different locations-- fast food place, golf course, bingo parlor. Sometimes O.J. is in disguise. Sometimes he's not. The idea was O.J. Would be someplace doing something, and Harmon's job was to help piss off the people around him. Or in prank show lingo--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:15:24.51" data-timestamp="924.51">Try to elevate the action.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:15:26.14" data-timestamp="926.14"> Exactly. For instance, on a golf course.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:15:29.33" data-timestamp="929.33">So the gag was O.J. Will keep golfing with his friends. And then I run on the golf course with a video camera pretending I'm paparazzi trying to film O.J.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:15:39.07" data-timestamp="939.07">There was no script. Also, sometimes, not even a road map. Sometimes the producer would jump into the scene himself to elevate the action even more. Or, mercifully, to help conclude it, like at the golf course.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:15:54.04" data-timestamp="954.04">That just ended with me and the producer of <i>Juiced</i> rolling around on the golf course wrestling. Because we didn't know how to end it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:16:05.41" data-timestamp="965.41">Here's the thing. Pranks might be a misleadingly precise term for what happens in the show. It's more like low-level harassment of random civilians. And also, O.J. Simpson is here! Let me walk you through one prank to show you how it goes. This one starts, like all of them do, with O.J. Simpson just dressed as himself, sitting in a chair, explaining the idea for the upcoming scene.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>O.j. Simpson</h4><p begin="00:16:30.45" data-timestamp="990.45">Set up a situation at an open house. I was visiting the house, looking for a house with my alleged girlfriend.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:16:36.13" data-timestamp="996.13">Then Harmon jumps in to explain his role in the scene.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:16:38.96" data-timestamp="998.96">I played disgruntled house owner. And then I played a party guy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:16:44.08" data-timestamp="1004.08">And then the prank starts. The scene for this prank, like O.J. said, is an open house. There's a realtor. She's in on the prank.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Realtor</h4><p begin="00:16:54.04" data-timestamp="1014.04">Hi.

They're surprised that he's there, but not weirded out. And then they all keep looking at the house. Then the realtor who, again, is part of the prank, knocks over a vase--</p><p begin="00:17:27.86" data-timestamp="1047.86">[VASE SHATTERING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Realtor</h4><p begin="00:17:29.84" data-timestamp="1049.84">--and blames one of the people looking at the house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Realtor</h4><p begin="00:17:32.27" data-timestamp="1052.27">He broke it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:17:33.59" data-timestamp="1053.59">Then Harmon, playing the homeowner, comes out and gets angry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:17:36.98" data-timestamp="1056.98">Why are you coming into my house and breaking my things?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Realtor</h4><p begin="00:17:37.81" data-timestamp="1057.81">I'm sorry. Gary--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:17:40.10" data-timestamp="1060.1">Then there's an argument, or an attempt at one.

Who's even getting pranked?</p><p begin="00:18:50.79" data-timestamp="1130.79">There are interesting moments in the scene, when a few people looking at the house notice O.J. and react to him. One couple is signing in at the kitchen counter, and the woman whispers to the man. It's so quiet they had to put subtitles on the screen. She whispers, "O.J. Simpson just came in." Then she says, "did you hear me? O.J. Simpson is right behind you." The guy with her glances over, and then they just keep looking around.</p><p begin="00:19:15.95" data-timestamp="1155.95">Another guy did a double take when he saw O.J. And then went back to signing in. Like, be cool, celebrity nearby, who is O.J. Simpson. But a lot of people seem oblivious. It's just one more freaky open house with a topless women on a trampoline and a lot of broken vases. Until finally, O.J. steps in with the catch phrase.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>O.j.

And I was completely wrong about that. Harmon told me that during the two weeks of filming, as far as he could remember, no one reacted that way. Other people on the set told me the same thing. There were no moments like that to cut out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:20:42.80" data-timestamp="1242.8">I thought, oh, man, there's going to be like just outraged people, or people freaking out.

In fact, let me step briefly outside Harmon's story of what it's like to make <i>Juiced</i> to talk more about what it's like to watch <i>Juiced.</i> I've shown this now to so many people, and the sheer scope of the chaos in the show is disorienting. Not just to me. Watching the show feels like being winked at from across the room by someone who may be flirting with you, or may be messing with you, or may just have a tic. It's not clear what to make of anything that's happening.</p><p begin="00:22:32.03" data-timestamp="1352.03">In between the pranks in <i>Juiced</i>, there's a scene-changing package that includes, for some reason, a gunshot sound effect--</p><p begin="00:22:38.58" data-timestamp="1358.58">[GUN SHOTS]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:22:39.98" data-timestamp="1359.98">--whatever that's supposed to mean, or not mean. And 20 to 30 seconds of music, during which O.J. is surrounded by strippers. Sometimes he's rapping, dressed as a pimp-- big fuzzy black hat, zebra striped lapels.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>O.j.

They give him lap dances. And again, this scene is in between nearly every prank. And he's surrounded by dancing women who mostly have long, blond hair and don't not resemble his dead ex-wife. And he's mugging to the camera with that expression, like, how great is this? But before you can decide what that means, if anything, besides just the demographics of who was available to shoot this scene, it's on to the next puzzling moment.</p><p begin="00:23:31.93" data-timestamp="1411.93">For instance, in the open house prank. At one point, Harmon, playing the angry homeowner whose house is being looked at, tries to blame O.J. for breaking one of the vases.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:23:41.25" data-timestamp="1421.25">Did you do this?

Says, "I've been blamed for enough shit," he sounds genuinely angry. Which means, I think, he's mad at being fake blamed for breaking a vase in a prank, because it reminds him that he was on trial for murder 10 years ago. There's a prank where O.J. pretends to be having an affair with another man's wife, and the man gets really angry. There's a prank where O.J. plays himself, but a homeless version of himself, selling bags of oranges by the side of the road.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>O.j.

No time to think. The show plows onward to smaller moments of just raw unlikableness. In one prank, O.J. is dressed as an employee of a fast food place, and he's working the drive-through window. A woman pulls up in her 40s, maybe early 50s.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:24:46.45" data-timestamp="1486.45"> Large fries, large orange juice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>O.j. Simpson</h4><p begin="00:24:49.75" data-timestamp="1489.75">You sure you want those large fries? You know what they're saying about fast food making you fat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:24:55.78" data-timestamp="1495.78">The women who's ordering is overweight, so that's the joke. She's fat. She's ordering fries. In <i>Juiced</i>, O.J. has plunged himself into reality TV, a genre that has no allegiance to the idea that the star has to come out looking good. But there's something off about this show that goes beyond that.</p><p begin="00:25:15.73" data-timestamp="1515.73">For all the frenzy on the screen, all the invitations to gawk, or be titillated, or outraged, or just shake your head in wonder, mostly it felt empty. It's tiring to watch, strangely tiring.</p><p begin="00:25:34.91" data-timestamp="1534.91">When I talked to Harmon, he said that during the filming, there were moments unlike any other reality show he'd worked on, unsurprisingly. For starters, as far as he could tell, everyone had been told the same thing he had-- don't bring up the murders or anything related to them. And no one did, except O.J. Before one prank, O.J. was being made up to look like an 81-year-old white man. The makeup took three hours to apply.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:26:00.80" data-timestamp="1560.8">While he's getting the makeup applied, he has the TV turned to Court TV. You know, and I was like, don't mention O.J., Court TV. Don't mention O.J.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:26:08.63" data-timestamp="1568.63">He's saying this to the TV?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:26:09.65" data-timestamp="1569.65">No, no. I'm saying this to myself. Like, oh Court TV, please don't mention O.J. Because I don't know how he would react. But he was actually just like-- he kind of wanted them to mention him. He was like, how are they going to work me into this, you know? You know, during my trial, my lawyers watched my back. You know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:26:26.66" data-timestamp="1586.66">So he would-- OK. So it was sort of reminiscing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:26:30.10" data-timestamp="1590.1">Yeah, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:26:30.72" data-timestamp="1590.72">While the women are putting the makeup on him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:26:32.64" data-timestamp="1592.64">Yep. He said he really liked watching Court TV.</p><p begin="00:26:39.17" data-timestamp="1599.17">Again, when he was getting the makeup applied, he would actually tell O.J. jokes. So we had the pleasure of hearing like O.J. Jokes from O.J. himself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:26:48.16" data-timestamp="1608.16">What's an O.J. joke?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:26:49.65" data-timestamp="1609.65">He actually said this. He goes, who's the first Jewish guy to get a Heisman Trophy? Fred Goldman, because he's got mine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:26:59.70" data-timestamp="1619.7">Because the Goldmans brought a civil suit against him that--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:27:02.09" data-timestamp="1622.09">Yeah, and took his--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:27:03.47" data-timestamp="1623.47">Money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:27:03.83" data-timestamp="1623.83">Heisman.

And others who thought, yeah, he was acquitted, but I still have other thoughts about what may have happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Luc Nicknair</h4><p begin="00:27:36.14" data-timestamp="1656.14">Definitely two schools of thought.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:27:38.03" data-timestamp="1658.03">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Luc Nicknair</h4><p begin="00:27:38.65" data-timestamp="1658.65">Yeah.

Actually, at the end of the shoot, this was the really messed up thing. They decided to shoot interviews with everyone of the crew about our experiences. And then, at the end of the interview, they would say, guilty or not guilty?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:28:00.48" data-timestamp="1680.48">Oh my God.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Luc Nicknair</h4><p begin="00:28:01.33" data-timestamp="1681.33">That did not get on the DVD.

That's why I did the job. You know, I secretly want to know. It's like-- and here I was going to be given an opportunity to go and shoot this deranged project, and I decided to do the gig.</p><p begin="00:28:33.56" data-timestamp="1713.56">I mean, I thought about that when I was involved with it. I thought about that. It's like, people are going to study this project. And all of a sudden, you called me 10 years later. [LAUGHS] You know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:28:51.89" data-timestamp="1731.89">Harmon, and Luc also, said Las Vegas, where they did the second week of shooting, is where things really turned sour and dark.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:29:00.70" data-timestamp="1740.7">They just seemed to sort of give up on ideas. And O.J. just got less and less interested in it. He didn't show up. And then we showed up, he was just like really drunk. Like O.J. was supposed to play a wacky motel clerk. You know? Like look out, here comes wacky motel clerk O.J.! You know, that's the premise of that gag. But he was just like completely drunk, and that was the first time they just sort of propped him up in the corner, like on a stool, and just let him be sort of near the pranks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:29:31.13" data-timestamp="1771.13">Harmon said he, Harmon, ended up playing the wacky motel clerk. And sometimes, he even had to be the one to tell people, you've been juiced! Whatever that means, when the person doing it is not O.J. Simpson.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Harmon Leon</h4><p begin="00:29:42.80" data-timestamp="1782.8">After I juice a couple, O.J.'s in the corner, drunk.

Simpson's lawyer, who handles media requests, didn't respond to my emails and phone calls about <i>Juiced.</i> I did reach the executive producer of <i>Juiced,</i> Rick Mahr. We talked on the phone-- after months of unanswered voicemails, texts, and emails from us, then, out of the blue, a legal document from him, just a little heads up. Then a series of very friendly but off the record conversations, mixed in with two taped interviews that he only agreed to if he could approve every quote. So here's what he approved.</p><p begin="00:30:32.94" data-timestamp="1832.94">He said, "I had it all wrong when I called <i>Juiced</i> the worst celebrity comeback vehicle ever made."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Mahr</h4><p begin="00:30:38.58" data-timestamp="1838.58">It was never meant to be a comeback vehicle for O.J. or try to turn him into a mainstream star again. We were tasked with creating a reality show that cut through the clutter, that everybody would be talking about, really during an era when there was a reality TV boom, and there was a lot of one upsmanship in the marketplace.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:30:59.65" data-timestamp="1859.65">He said the goal was just to let the cameras run, whether O.J. looked good or not. He said the show being a pile on of one thing after another that may or may not make sense-- the blond strippers, the dead-end pranks, the weird little verite moments-- that's not a fumble. It's exactly what they were going for. Their business model was get people talking, so pile it on.</p><p begin="00:31:21.70" data-timestamp="1881.7">He said, look, this wasn't designed to win Emmys. It's supposed to be a nonstop barrage of craziness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Mahr</h4><p begin="00:31:27.37" data-timestamp="1887.37">You know, I'd be the first to say it.

He buried the project on purpose.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Mahr</h4><p begin="00:31:45.08" data-timestamp="1905.08">We had the blinders on to make one crazy reality TV show.

From the time. It's called <i>O.J.</i> <i>Un</i><i>gloved</i>, the <i>Lost</i> <i>Tapes</i>. He's got the domain name ojsimpson.com. Makes sense-- the 20th anniversary of the murder trial verdict is coming up this fall. There's a multipart FX miniseries in the works. Cuba Gooding Junior is playing O.J. They filmed the Bronco scene a few weeks ago.</p><p begin="00:33:00.40" data-timestamp="1980.4">Rick didn't want to say if <i>Juiced</i> was O.J.'s idea or not. When I asked if O.J. was paid for it, he said, O.J. did this because he wanted to do it. He said his understanding is that O.J. did see <i>Juiced</i>, every frame, and approved it before it went out. When I asked Rick if O.J. had ever said, look, this is how I want to be portrayed in this show, Rick said the answers to what <i>O.J.</i> wanted out of <i>Juiced</i>, or why he did it in the first place, are locked in O.J.'s head. All he, Rick, could say is how unworried O.J. seemed to him while they were filming, like anyway they put the footage together would be great, because it was O.J.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Mahr</h4><p begin="00:33:40.75" data-timestamp="2020.75">I think history has shown that O.J.

And it was very terrible and shocking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:22.29" data-timestamp="2542.29">We were talking about this week's program around the office, and one of our producers, Zoe Chace, remembered this story. It happened when she was right out of college, and she got the call. Her dad, out of the blue, had a heart attack and died. And her best friend, Rosa, came and got Zoe from Ohio, which is where she was living, and brought her back to New York City, where her family was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:42:40.70" data-timestamp="2560.7">And it was awful. You know, it was just grim darkness. But then, somehow like the next day, Rosa was just pulling stuff out of the fridge to feed me with. And she pulls out the butter dish, you know? A glass butter dish. And it just shatters all over the floor.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:02.57" data-timestamp="2582.57">You mean she drops it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:03.85" data-timestamp="2583.85">She drops it. And I just look at her, and I'm like, that was my dad's. (LAUGHING) It was just-- I was like, horrified! And my sister starts laughing, and I started laughing. Because it's not my dad's. It's just like a crappy butter dish from IKEA. And it was the first-- I think it was the first joke I remember. I remember it as the first joke of when my dad died.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:28.99" data-timestamp="2608.99">How many days?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:30.83" data-timestamp="2610.83">It was like a day. It was like the day after.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:34.22" data-timestamp="2614.22">So the whole idea of-- you know the old saying, comedy equals tragedy plus time, there was no time at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:43:41.30" data-timestamp="2621.3">Not at all. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:45.14" data-timestamp="2625.14"> There's a study where scientists actually tried to quantify exactly how much time has to pass after tragedy before comedy kicks in. And although nothing is more tedious than people sitting around theorizing about what is funny, it's interesting to see somebody get super brass tacks about this and try to actually define this thing that our whole program is about today. These researchers had over 1,000 people rate how funny some joke tweets about Hurricane Sandy were at different points in time. And before the hurricane hit land, people thought the tweets were funny. And then, unsurprisingly, while the hurricane was destroying homes, and knocking out power, and killing people, and in the immediate aftermath of all that, the tweets did not seem funny and in fact seemed kind of offensive.</p><p begin="00:44:30.21" data-timestamp="2670.21">And then, it took-- they have a number-- it took 15 days. 15 days after the hurricane struck, the tweets started to seem funny again. Because the researchers-- Peter McGraw, Lawrence Williams, and Caleb Warren-- theorize for something like this to be funny, it has to seem threatening, but not too threatening. Once it stops being threatening, it stops being funny. And in fact, there comes a point after the storm struck-- it is 36 days after the storm struck-- that people start finding the tweets less and less funny.</p><p begin="00:45:02.78" data-timestamp="2702.78">And, to get back to Zoe, Zoe says, yeah, it was only a day after her dad's death that she joked about the butter dish. But the worst had already happened. The threat had past. If her dad had been alive and in imminent danger of dying, she said she couldn't have made the joke, wouldn't have had the impulse to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:45:19.50" data-timestamp="2719.5">Because that just sounds so scary, that that would be all you were doing, is being afraid. But now, or right at that moment that I was in--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:32.81" data-timestamp="2732.81">Immediately after he died.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:45:34.25" data-timestamp="2734.25">Immediately after. I mean, nobody had been themselves, or said anything funny, or laughed about anything. It was super helpful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:43.31" data-timestamp="2743.31">Helpful how?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:45:45.36" data-timestamp="2745.36">Because I felt like myself, and it felt like my family. You know, we're not such a sincere group of people. And so to have that level of sincere emotion was pretty uncomfortable.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:59.98" data-timestamp="2759.98">[CHUCKLES] Wow.

<h3>Act Two: Pink Slip</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:13.91" data-timestamp="2773.91">Which brings us to this next story of a family, and something being too soon, and then knowing the right moment for the something to happen. We've arrived at Act 2 of our program. Act two, Pink Slip. When Amy Silverman was in her 20s, she had this friend who would go to LA sometimes and bring back these videos. And Amy and her friends would show the videos at parties. On VHS-- this is way back in the prehistoric days, before YouTube.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:46:38.41" data-timestamp="2798.41">This was the '90s. But in Phoenix. So it's probably like the '80s somewhere else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:45.44" data-timestamp="2805.44">And one of the films the guy would bring around to parties was called <i>Pink</i> <i>Slip</i>. Amy says she easily saw it a half dozen times, maybe it was more like a dozen. It always killed. Everybody liked it. It was an instructional video, and its lead character was this girl named Jill, who was just reaching puberty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:47:01.27" data-timestamp="2821.27">I've never been able to figure out when exactly it was made. But probably like late '60s, early '70s. Kind of groovy living room, and they have very outdated hair. Very, very obviously staged. And that was what was so funny about it, really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:17.07" data-timestamp="2837.07">The film was about menstruation. And so if you're listening with a little kid right now, and you do not want to get into that subject with them right this second, take that into advisement. OK, here's a clip.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:47:27.63" data-timestamp="2847.63">Susie, do you have periods?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:47:30.16" data-timestamp="2850.16">Do I have periods? Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days. When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:47:42.22" data-timestamp="2862.22">Well, Susie, what about my teacher? Does Miss Jones have periods?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:47:46.36" data-timestamp="2866.36">Yes, Jill. Your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods. All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:54.41" data-timestamp="2874.41">Hi, girls.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:47:55.40" data-timestamp="2875.4">Hi, Dad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:47:56.26" data-timestamp="2876.26">What have you girls been talking about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:47:58.51" data-timestamp="2878.51">About periods, Daddy! Dad, does Aunt Carol have periods?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:48:03.94" data-timestamp="2883.94">Yes, Jill. All women have periods about every four weeks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:07.48" data-timestamp="2887.48">So it's very repetitive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:48:09.12" data-timestamp="2889.12">And we would watch it and shriek with laughter. Not proud of it, but that is what happened. A lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:48:16.77" data-timestamp="2896.77">Blood from inside a woman's body comes outside, from an opening between her legs, about every four weeks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:48:23.33" data-timestamp="2903.33">But the blood? Won't it get on my clothes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:48:25.62" data-timestamp="2905.62">No, it won't. Because you use a sanitary pad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:48:28.22" data-timestamp="2908.22">A sanitary pad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:29.88" data-timestamp="2909.88">Amy says it did register with her that there was something up with that girl, Jill. Something different. But she never really gave it much thought. And she and her friends would drink, and they'd watch this kitschy old film. And years later, when Amy was 37, she had her second child-- a daughter, Sophie. And Sophie had Down Syndrome.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:48:49.38" data-timestamp="2929.38">So when Sophie was like two weeks old, all of a sudden I was driving down the street one day, and I went, oh my god, <i>Pink</i> <i>Slip</i>! And suddenly, it all came together for me, and I realized that that video had been about a girl with Down Syndrome. And now I had a baby with Down Syndrome. And some day, I was going to have to figure out how to teach her about puberty. And then, as quickly as that thought came into my head, I shoved it out and replaced it with, I don't know, a need for diapers or something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:23.35" data-timestamp="2963.35">Years pass, and by the time Sophie was 10, she had seen her older sister become an adolescent, and Sophie was obsessed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:49:30.60" data-timestamp="2970.6">She had a bra collection. She had a deodorant collection.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:34.94" data-timestamp="2974.94">Not that she needed a bra or deodorant just yet, Amy says. There was one false alarm, where it seemed like she was growing hair in new places.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:49:42.26" data-timestamp="2982.26">And she started jumping up and down. She ran down the hallway naked into her sister's room to show her. She grabbed my cell phone and called one of my friends, and she raced around the kitchen table as fast as she could, again and again, you know, just talking about her hair with my mom, with my friend, with my husband.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:00.83" data-timestamp="3000.83">Oh, she really wants to hit puberty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:50:03.66" data-timestamp="3003.66">She really wants to hit puberty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:06.07" data-timestamp="3006.07">Amy and her husband decided to enroll Sophie in a class about puberty, a one-time seminar for kids with Down Syndrome, to answer their questions and teach them what they needed to know about what was going to happen to them, taught by this woman who is an expert on all that. And it was OK. It was fine. Though it didn't do the job for Sophie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:50:22.03" data-timestamp="3022.03">Sophie was-- you know, she was about to turn 12, and she was still asking questions.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:26.20" data-timestamp="3026.2">What were the questions she was asking?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:50:28.19" data-timestamp="3028.19">She wanted to know the basics about her period. About where the blood would come out, what she would use. Just basics. And I thought, you know what? Maybe I should show her <i>Pink Slip.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:44.99" data-timestamp="3044.99">This was honestly something she had never considered before. She'd never taken that video seriously.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:50:49.14" data-timestamp="3049.14">No. No! We made fun of it. So I got the video up for her, for her to see.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:58.36" data-timestamp="3058.36">Now, I know you recorded a conversation with her before you showed her the video. Let me just play that piece of tape. Here we go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:51:03.93" data-timestamp="3063.93">Do you remember what we're talking about today?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:51:06.54" data-timestamp="3066.54">Periods.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:51:08.54" data-timestamp="3068.54">Yep. And now, do you feel like you already know everything about them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sophie</h4><p begin="00:51:12.15" data-timestamp="3072.15">Yup. Because last year, I had a puberty lesson. And they sang a song-- "Just Around the Corner."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:19.92" data-timestamp="3079.92">She's saying last year they did a puberty lesson, and they sang a song-- "Just Around the Corner." That's how she knows everything. Amy pulled up <i>Pink</i> <i>Slip</i> on her phone because, of course, it's on YouTube.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:51:30.12" data-timestamp="3090.12">And, unlike me, Sophie loves to watch videos on YouTube. So she grabbed it and watched it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:51:35.49" data-timestamp="3095.49">And so let's watch the video.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:51:37.65" data-timestamp="3097.65">So let's watch the video?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:51:38.53" data-timestamp="3098.53">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:51:38.88" data-timestamp="3098.88">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:51:39.77" data-timestamp="3099.77">Yes, what about periods?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:51:41.70" data-timestamp="3101.7">Do you have periods?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:44.06" data-timestamp="3104.06">In the recording that Amy made of Sophie watching <i>Pink Slip,</i> there is a moment where they both laugh. It's the most shocking moment in the film, and it really is kind of shocking. Again, if you are listening right now with a small child, know that I am about to say something very frank about menstruation. And just decide if you want to keep listening.</p><p begin="00:52:02.21" data-timestamp="3122.21">The moment that Amy and Sophie laugh at in the video is one that Amy remembers very well from back when she used to watch the video with her friends at parties. It's kind of the big moment in the film.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:52:10.84" data-timestamp="3130.84">Well, this was like the grabber at the parties. Where Jill would say to Susie, you know, I don't understand or something. And Susie would say, well, come into the bathroom with me, Jill. I have my period right now. And then sit down, and pull down her pants, and show her bloody pad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:52:28.55" data-timestamp="3148.55">This is a used sanitary pad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:52:30.28" data-timestamp="3150.28">Look, there's blood on it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:52:33.26" data-timestamp="3153.26">See?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill</h4><p begin="00:52:34.92" data-timestamp="3154.92">You mean the blood's coming from inside your body now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susie</h4><p begin="00:52:38.54" data-timestamp="3158.54">That's right.</p><p begin="00:52:38.71" data-timestamp="3158.71">[SNICKERS]</p><p begin="00:52:39.08" data-timestamp="3159.08">Blood is coming from inside my body through an opening between my legs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:52:43.31" data-timestamp="3163.31">For the record, I laughed first.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sophie</h4><p begin="00:52:45.90" data-timestamp="3165.9">Yep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:46.57" data-timestamp="3166.57">Just a minute later, after the sister shows the girl in the film how to throw away a used pad and start using a new pad, Sophie watches intently and quietly says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sophie</h4><p begin="00:52:57.98" data-timestamp="3177.98">I get it now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:00.34" data-timestamp="3180.34">Back at the parties that Amy used to go to, when the scene drew the biggest laughs and the most comments, it was just too soon for Amy to get what the video would be good for-- for a girl like Sophie.</p><p begin="00:53:11.30" data-timestamp="3191.3">What was it like watching her watch this video that you knew so well?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:53:16.87" data-timestamp="3196.87">Completely surreal. Completely surreal. I mean, embarrassing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:26.09" data-timestamp="3206.09">Why was it embarrassing?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:53:28.59" data-timestamp="3208.59">Oh, I was embarrassed because I used to make fun of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:32.01" data-timestamp="3212.01"> But Sophie didn't know that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:53:36.52" data-timestamp="3216.52">No, but I don't feel like that really honored her. You know? My prior behavior.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:44.07" data-timestamp="3224.07">Oh, I see what you're saying. Here you are. You've got this little girl who you love. And now, with her present, you're returning to the scene of the crime.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:53:52.47" data-timestamp="3232.47">Yeah. I felt more ashamed than embarrassed. But I had to stop and think, huh, maybe the person who made that video really knew what they were doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:02.86" data-timestamp="3242.86"> Yeah. That's the thing I was wondering, is did it give you a respect for the video?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:54:07.70" data-timestamp="3247.7">It did. It was really weird.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:11.73" data-timestamp="3251.73">And so all the corny repetition in the whole thing, that's totally right for her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:54:16.40" data-timestamp="3256.4">That's what she needs. It just has to be slowed down. The learning has to be slowed down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:23.18" data-timestamp="3263.18">Do you feel like a certain amount of being a parent is realizing what an ass you were before you were a parent?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:54:29.39" data-timestamp="3269.39">Yes. Absolutely. I mean, I was the one who-- I always tell people this. I was the one who would switch lines at Safeway if there was a person with a developmental disability bagging groceries. Because I just didn't want to deal. It would've taken, what? 15 seconds to nod and smile? And be a human being about it? Not me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:01.38" data-timestamp="3301.38">Amy's thought about showing <i>Pink</i> <i>Slip</i> to Sophie again. It's been a few months, and Sophie still has not gotten her period. Though Amy's not sure what Sophie would think of the video today. Because Sophie's able to tell that the girl in the video has Down Syndrome. And Sophie is going through a thing right now where she does not like to identify herself that way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:55:19.68" data-timestamp="3319.68">Not to get all serious on you, but Sophie is starting to realize that she's-- she's not going to ever have some of the things that her sister has. So recently, she asked me, am I going to have Down Syndrome when I grow up? And I said, you are. And she said, I don't want to. I don't want to have it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:40.60" data-timestamp="3340.6">Oh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:55:42.38" data-timestamp="3342.38"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:44.37" data-timestamp="3344.37">So what does her sister get that she doesn't get, that she sees right now?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Silverman</h4><p begin="00:55:49.90" data-timestamp="3349.9"> She gets to go to a fancy art school that won't take Sophie. She gets to dance on point in ballet, which Sophie doesn't get to do because her feet aren't strong enough. She gets sleepover invitations Sophie doesn't get. And she gets that life in front of her. You know, she-- Sophie told me the other day that she doesn't want to have an aid at school anymore, because she wants to practice walking to class by herself for college.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:19.91" data-timestamp="3379.91">What Sophie will get that her sister got, and she'll probably get it pretty soon, is her period. And Amy might show her <i>Pink</i> <i>Slip</i> again. Amy tried once to show the video to Sophie's older sister. And the older sister got to the part with the bloody pad and then tossed the phone back to Amy. But Sophie's different, and she liked the video. <i>Pink Slip</i> was what she needed.</p></div> </div>
