I'm going to write the station. I'm going to write the chamber of commerce.</p><p begin="00:00:30.08" data-timestamp="30.08">[RADIO TUNING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:00:30.49" data-timestamp="30.49"> --basketball team. I always wanted to go to Miami High--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:37.39" data-timestamp="37.39"> You ever flip through the dial, past the stations that you listen to all the time, just skim up the dial, slowly, from station to station, waiting for something? You don't even know what. Something. Anything.</p><p begin="00:00:50.10" data-timestamp="50.1">[RADIO TUNING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:51.01" data-timestamp="51.01"> [SPEAKING INUIT]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:56.67" data-timestamp="56.67"> Something like this, a radio signal whose source is impossible to figure out and the intimacy of one voice. What could be more personal, even in another language?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:08.18" data-timestamp="68.18"> [SPEAKING INUIT] Hello to you, Barney and Rosie. Hello to you, Rose. I'm happy to you-- OK, I'm singing to you Ayatollah Khomeini [SPEAKING INUIT] [BEGINS SINGING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.63" data-timestamp="101.63"> This recording off the radio is one of those things that got recorded and then was passed from person to person to person. Finally, it ended up on a compilation tape of radio moments put together by radio station WFMU in New Jersey. And that's how we got it. By anybody's best guess, it's a radio station in northern Canada. The speaker is Inuit.</p><p begin="00:02:01.64" data-timestamp="121.64">And here's where it gets a little hazier. Because they're talking about a strike over and over on this tape, it's possible that this is a situation where the regular radio staff is on strike, and these are the replacement workers. Or it's possible that these are the regular workers who are about to go on strike, fed up, at the end of their rope. Or maybe that's not the story at all.</p><p begin="00:02:24.96" data-timestamp="144.96">That's actually one of the things that I like about this. Like a lot of good radio, part of what is so appealing about it is what it leaves you wondering and thinking about when it's over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:02:34.74" data-timestamp="154.74"> [SPEAKING INUIT]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:29.08" data-timestamp="209.08"> Can you imagine tuning your radio and stumbling upon this? You know, just stumbling on this? It's so ephemeral, this moment just happening and passing and about to actually evaporate into nothing forever. And that's part of what makes radio different from other media, I think, that quality where it can seem so small and so fleeting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:53.72" data-timestamp="233.72"> [SPEAKING INUIT]</p><p begin="00:04:03.17" data-timestamp="243.17">[RADIO TUNING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:08.14" data-timestamp="248.14"> Ian Brown used to host the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation show <i>Sunday</i> <i>Morning</i>, and he was very great to listen to. He was smart and unpretentious and this great interviewer and writer. And when the show was revamped and he was taken off the air as host, he read this little radio essay on his last day about the intimacy of radio-- the false intimacy of radio, that feeling that we get together every week, you and me. I mean, literally, that's what it feels like. It feels like you and me. You and me, even though we don't know each other at all.</p><p begin="00:04:46.65" data-timestamp="286.65">Anyway, months passed after he ended that job, and we wanted to get him on our show-- on <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> And I called him up, and he was not brusk but businesslike, very proper, formal. And it sounds ridiculous to say-- I feel sort of silly saying it-- but it was hard not to feel a little strange about it. It was hard not to feel a little bit like here is this friend who went suddenly cold.</p><p begin="00:05:16.01" data-timestamp="316.01">And I would not feel that way about Ted Koppel or Peter Jennings or anybody else who I've ever seen on television. I can tell you that. There is just something about radio. There's just something about radio. It's more personal.</p><p begin="00:05:38.58" data-timestamp="338.58">Well, this is our hundredth episode of <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. Each week on our program, we choose a theme, and for our hundredth show, we bring you an hour of stories about the medium in which we work . A program on radio-- what makes it great when it's great, what makes it terrible when it's terrible, which it often is. Act One of our program today, Brigadoon. Searching for an illegal radio station in Miami that keeps appearing and disappearing and appearing again in the mist.</p><p begin="00:06:01.25" data-timestamp="361.25">Act Two, The Invisible Leading the Blind. Jack Hitt stumbles on a radio station that seems to completely ignore the last six decades of broadcasting style and convention.</p><p begin="00:06:11.95" data-timestamp="371.95">Act Three, Radio Most People Listen To, an act in which we spend some time with the radio programmers who think that it's better to play the same exact songs over and over all day long, the consultants who make every radio station sound the same. In short, the thinking that makes most radio in America today so boring, and we defend those guys.</p><p begin="00:06:32.77" data-timestamp="392.77">Act Four, Noble Calling. A winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who says that when peace comes to his country of East Timor, he has just one wish. He wants to do a radio show like Howard Stern's. Stay with us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:06:46.63" data-timestamp="406.63"> The following program is furnished by.</p><p begin="00:06:48.89" data-timestamp="408.89">[RADIO TUNING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:06:49.04" data-timestamp="409.04"> Are you married or are you living in sin?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:06:52.24" data-timestamp="412.24"> A little of each.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rapper</h4><p begin="00:06:54.08" data-timestamp="414.08"> You blast me, boy.

<h3>Act One: Brigadoon</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:57.06" data-timestamp="417.06"> Act One, Brigadoon. We're devoting this first half of our program to the ephemeral thrill of stumbling onto some radio station, some radio moment, that you don't know where it came from, and you don't know what it is, but you just cannot stop listening. We have this first story from Iggy Scam in Miami.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Scam</h4><p begin="00:07:14.11" data-timestamp="434.11"> My friend [? Sinclair ?] was the one who first found the Northside black power pirate radio station way down the left of the FM dial. You could only tune it in up on the Northside, so we'd listen to it while we drove down 79th Street whenever I went to his house. You could tell it was pirate radio because of the number of times the DJs would say [BLEEP] in every sentence.</p><p begin="00:07:32.85" data-timestamp="452.85">They'd play all this poorly-recorded local rap, like this one song, "Too Many Suckers and Not Enough Stretchers" where the guy raps, "Living in the M, the I, the A-M-I. Sometimes, I've got to ask myself why." And then they'd play Tupac and then, every couple of beats, the DJs would just cut in over it and just scream, howl, or go "Uh!" And then the music would cut out completely.</p><p begin="00:07:59.13" data-timestamp="479.13">Most of the time, there'd be four or five DJs all in the room with the mic, all just talking and yelling and telling jokes over the music. It was totally loud and chaotic and fun. They even took phone calls somehow. They'd play a beat over the radio, and then people would call up to rap over it over the phone. Talk about DIY.</p><p begin="00:08:19.59" data-timestamp="499.59">Actually, they were never really that overtly political at all, really. We only called it the "black power station" because of one time when they were taking calls, and this dude called up and said, check it out, man. Southern Bell van's been parked in front of my house for three days. There ain't nothing wrong with the goddamn phone. It's the white man spying on us and trying to keep us down. Like I said, it was a great station.</p><p begin="00:08:42.18" data-timestamp="522.18">Besides being really great radio, the station was exciting. Who were these guys? Where did they broadcast from? And how did everyone in the city know their number to call in when they never gave it out over the air? When the DJs talked, I'd listen to see if there was even some discernible code that they used. I couldn't catch one. I never found out anything about it, really, and eventually, I just moved away from Miami.</p><p begin="00:09:04.14" data-timestamp="544.14">But after all my plans fell apart one by one last year, I found myself back in Miami trying to sort it all out. I ended up living back up on the Northside, off 79th Street. Good old 79th Street, home to the "Welcome To Miami" water tower and the INS building. Six lanes of road from beach to swamp, full of rusty, old, American cars blasting bass. The home of the urban trailer park and the indoor flea market, the $0.99 quart of malt liquor.</p><p begin="00:09:31.05" data-timestamp="571.05">I always thought 79th Street, and not the beaches or hotels, is probably the true heart of Miami. You could look at everything and think, this was all once somebody's idea of a good idea. Right away, I started trying to tune in to the station, but I couldn't seem to find it. I didn't know if my radio had bad reception or if they'd just gone off the air. I wasn't even sure of the exact frequency, really. I became sort of obsessed with finding out what happened to those guys, but there was no way to find out.</p><p begin="00:10:02.93" data-timestamp="602.93">Meanwhile, I kept busy taking long bike rides to explore the Northside, an almost touching daily tour of the very architecture of defeat. Often, I rode by sad, old Bobby Maduro Stadium, which is named for a Cuban baseball star who had never made the majors. Originally, it had been built in the '50s by a Cuban financier who was trying to lure Major League Baseball into Miami. And even then, he built it way too small for the major leagues.</p><p begin="00:10:29.18" data-timestamp="629.18">The financier lost all his money eventually, backing Castro, and then later backing anti-Castro revolutionaries. By the 1980s, the stadium was only used as a shelter and processing center for Nicaraguan refugees. And now, it was a host to a weekend flea market in its parking lot.</p><p begin="00:10:53.04" data-timestamp="653.04">Eventually, I pretty much fell in love with the Northside for its own sake, and I gave up the search for the station. But then one time, on my daily ride past the unused warehouses and huge fenced-off lots full of weed and rubble and the boarded-up housing projects, I found what could've been an important clue about the station. Down at the end of a dead-end street where almost certainly no one would see it, someone had spray painted "Tape Radio, 61.5 WEED."</p><p begin="00:11:28.16" data-timestamp="688.16">Now, 61.5 would seem to be a radio frequency. WEED would seem to be a station's call letters. Was this some kind of ad? How could it be a station, though, if the FM band doesn't even go down that low? Even if there could be a station at 61.5, no one would have a radio that could tune it in. 61.5 would almost certainly be dead air-- static.</p><p begin="00:11:49.35" data-timestamp="709.35">I decided to even try it as a phone number--615-WEED. Not in service. I figured that since there's never really any people walking around down there on that dead-end street, if 61.5 was somehow a station, they were probably broadcasting from a warehouse on that very street and that the broadcasters themselves must have painted it. Later that same day, I found the exact same spray painted message in the same exact writing in black paint 30 blocks north in Little Haiti.</p><p begin="00:12:23.57" data-timestamp="743.57">I never did find out what it meant. But that night, it was hot as hell outside-- the beginning of the Miami summer-- and I was just laying around feeling sweaty and miserable when I checked the radio for first time in weeks. And I couldn't believe it. The station was back on the air. DJ Funky One was on, playing music and taking calls. He'd play a little instrumental beat part, and then suddenly cut in completely over the music, put the caller on the air and yell, what's up?</p><p begin="00:12:46.93" data-timestamp="766.93">Caller would say, I want to say it two times for Little Haiti. DJ Funky One would say, all right, baby. Little Haiti's in the house. What's up? Next caller wanted to say one time for the Larchmont clique. All right, what's up? One time for Arena Towers, one time for the 6-8, one time for Edison, two times for the 7-4 boys, and a shout out to Shadow Man. It went on all night, music and calls.</p><p begin="00:13:09.82" data-timestamp="789.82">Outside my window, the station's signal was flying strong over the dark, rosy streets and avenues, past the open windows and open apartment doors and front porches, and the whole sad city out there sweating in the night. I drank some tall cans from the 79th and Biscayne gas station beer special and listened, and it felt like every radio in the Northside must be tuned in.</p><p begin="00:13:33.95" data-timestamp="813.95">Finally, after a while, I heard the phone number actually given out on the air. So one afternoon, when only music was on and they weren't taking calls, I called up anyway. I couldn't believe it when DJ Funky One himself actually answered the phone. I said, "Uh, what are you guys called?"</p><p begin="00:13:51.59" data-timestamp="831.59">He said, "We're the Space Station."</p><p begin="00:13:54.50" data-timestamp="834.5">"Well, where do you guys broadcast from?"</p><p begin="00:13:58.17" data-timestamp="838.17">"Carol City."</p><p begin="00:14:00.83" data-timestamp="840.83">I said, "Do you, like, have a license or anything?"</p><p begin="00:14:05.06" data-timestamp="845.06">And DJ Funky One started laughing really hard, and he said, "Yeah, yeah. We got all that [BLEEP], man." And then he hung up on me.</p><p begin="00:14:20.45" data-timestamp="860.45">Carol City was at the very north end of the county. It had originally been a white, suburban subdivision, but eventually, it was where city planners tried to get the rising black population of the '60s to move to when the city needed new slum land as far away from downtown as possible. These days, it's a seedy, menacing residential sprawl of little homes and gang graffiti known widely as a place where kids from white, suburban subdivisions go to buy drugs.</p><p begin="00:14:48.95" data-timestamp="888.95">I rode up there, but I found no more graffiti clues to the station's whereabouts. Later, with a car radio, I found that you couldn't even get the station that well north of 125th Street, which is about 60 blocks south of Carol City. So I think that DJ Funky One was probably lying about Carol City.</p><p begin="00:15:10.10" data-timestamp="910.1">So I started keeping my eyes open for any new clues on my ride home from the more wealthy southern parts of town, where I was working. It was a long ride home but always interesting. When you left downtown for the Northside, it was like crossing over into the flip side of the postcard. You rode out of the pink and blue neon glare of air-conditioned malls and chain stores and gated condos and hotels and skyscrapers into a dark, narrow maze of funky old wood houses, hand-painted signs, and corner stores. The suburbs have the police protection, but the Northside has voodoo.</p><p begin="00:15:46.94" data-timestamp="946.94">Well finally, one day I got a huge clue when the station was apparently having an on-air live promo party. DJ Funky One said, come on down. We've got all this great food down here at Mama's Kitchen. We've got the fried chicken plate for five bucks and Mama's conch dinner for seven bucks. Could it be? DJ Funky One and a pirate radio transmitter live in a restaurant?</p><p begin="00:16:07.61" data-timestamp="967.61">The address they gave out was only a couple blocks away in the heart of Little Haiti. But when I got there, there was no restaurant at all, just two black dudes on a couch in front of this tiny house cut up into four efficiencies. There was no music anywhere. There was no sign of a transmitter.</p><p begin="00:16:21.73" data-timestamp="981.73">I said, "Uh, are you guys with the radio station?" They looked at me like I was crazy and nodded. "This is Mama's Kitchen?" I could smell chicken. They said it was.</p><p begin="00:16:35.06" data-timestamp="995.06">I said, "But where's DJ Funky One? Where's the station?"</p><p begin="00:16:39.34" data-timestamp="999.34">They broke up laughing, and then one guy said, "Everyone wants to know that."</p><p begin="00:16:49.90" data-timestamp="1009.9">So Mama's Kitchen was really just some guy's mom's kitchen. I ended up passing on the conch dinner, and I just bought a frozen cup of Cherry Kool-Aid for a quarter. I took it to my favorite spot by the tracks and sat there with it, laughing in the summer heat. Now that I'd met two people from the station-- or had I?-- the whole thing was even more mysterious.</p><p begin="00:17:09.83" data-timestamp="1029.83">Well, I guess I don't mind not knowing, and now I'll probably never find out more about the station because now it was time to move away from the Northside. But I had one last Saturday night with the station, one last night of the station sending out the Miami-style bass to be packaged and delivered to the suburbs via 79th Street in a great, rusted 1971 Oldsmobile. One last ride through the ruins and failing streets and bad ideas that talk to you late at night, like radio.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:45.94" data-timestamp="1065.94"> Iggy Scam's story first appeared in his handwritten, self-published zine <i>Scam.</i> Some music during this story was by the Mission Burrito Project in San Francisco, which delivers free, organic, vegan burritos to the homeless one night a week.</p></div> </div>

Occasionally, they air the show on the local college channel, which is how I heard it. But for the most part, Mike and Gordon's universe shares in our air space but is not of it. It's what Lake Wobegon would be if real people lived there, and then broadcast their own show without Garrison Keillor. In this alternate universe, the men are not always strong. Rather, they are savagely beaten by their wives.

A few years back, V103 was in fourth or fifth place. But radio is not an art, my friend. No, no no. It's a science. And by applying scientific principles, consultant Tony Gray and program director Max Myrick transformed V103 until it tied for number one in the Chicago market, year after year, with adults age 25 to 54. This, of course, means lots more ad revenue, much bigger profits. Twice as many adults listen to them as listen to Chicago's public radio station.</p><p begin="00:30:00.13" data-timestamp="1800.13">The story of how Max and Tony did this, made their station number one, is the story of how radio works-- pretty much every commercial station on the dial. This is the science of modern radio. And it begins here, 15 blocks away from the radio station.</p><p begin="00:30:20.80" data-timestamp="1820.8">These are the offices of a company that V103 hires called Strategic Media Research. Every day, young women in 10 windowless rooms get on the phone in the late afternoon and early evening and call radio listeners. It's targeted research. For V103, they only call the listeners that V103 wants more than any others. These are 35- to 44-year-old African-American women. They go for women rather than for men for a very simple reason, Tony Gray tells me. Women are more likely to actually fill out the Arbitron diaries, which ratings are based on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tony Gray</h4><p begin="00:30:50.83" data-timestamp="1850.83"> In most cases across the country, the stations target females because you know you can rely on the women to fill out the diaries.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:05.01" data-timestamp="1865.01"> So they get these women on the phone, and they hook them up to a computer which plays them brief clips of 30 different songs over the phone. It takes about 15 minutes. For each song, the women press numbers on the phone's keypad to indicate if they're familiar with the song, how much they like the song, and if they're getting bored of the song, which Max says is the most important thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:31:23.66" data-timestamp="1883.66"> Once you get a record on the air, you have to know when to take it off, because there's nothing that'll drive a person away from a station than a song that they're just tired of.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:39.69" data-timestamp="1899.69"> Every week, a printout of the audience scores arrives on Max's desk. And he marks it up, dividing the songs into A songs, B songs, C songs. A songs will be played on V103 every three and a half hours. B songs will be played every five hours. Cs will be played twice a day. These 30 songs are the only new songs that V103 plays They make up 40% of the music on the station.</p><p begin="00:32:01.98" data-timestamp="1921.98">The other 60% is what radio programmers call "golds," proven songs that always test well with the target audience. For V103, that means Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing," anything by Anita Baker. On last week's list, Max crossed off six songs that just did not test well enough to stay on the station, one of them a sentimental favorite for Max by his favorite artist, an artist that he does not want me to name on the radio. So I'll just say that he's a crossover black artist who married Lisa Marie Presley.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:32:27.18" data-timestamp="1947.18"> The reason this song is in brackets is because we've been playing it for several weeks. So it's saying it'll never be a hit. The research is saying it's not going to happen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:36.33" data-timestamp="1956.33"> Now, you like this song.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:32:37.10" data-timestamp="1957.1"> I love this song. I love the artist.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:40.00" data-timestamp="1960"> But you cannot let those feelings interfere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:32:42.14" data-timestamp="1962.14"> No, it's not about me. It's about listeners. It's about playing what they want.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:47.71" data-timestamp="1967.71"> You have your own radio station here. You can play whatever you want.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:32:50.70" data-timestamp="1970.7"> That's my job. You said the most important thing. I have my own radio station at home. And I play all the stuff I want to play as often as I want to play it. I make tapes. But when I come here, it's about business-- big business. Millions of dollars are affected by the decisions we make. So that's the real bottom line.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:11.76" data-timestamp="1991.76"> V103 has four competitors who are going after the same demographic group that they are. The average person, says Max, jumps around between two and three radio stations all the time. If at any moment V103 has a song that scores lower with the audience and one of its competitors has a song that scores higher, V103 loses.</p><p begin="00:33:29.27" data-timestamp="2009.27">Some programming tidbits I picked up during my visit to V103-- if you play rap music, you pretty much say goodbye to any adult audience. So even stations that target African-Americans usually don't play much rap. V103 plays none. Sampling is another matter. One of the reasons that sampling bits of old songs so popular now in pop music has to do with the way that radio stations operate, with the science of modern radio.</p><p begin="00:33:52.54" data-timestamp="2032.54">Picture-- if you were a songwriter and you put some famous old clip from a pop song into your song, when radio stations do those telephone surveys of listeners, way more listeners, especially older listeners, are likely to say that they recognize and like your song. And radio stations will add your song to the playlist. One of the songs that Max is adding is a song called "Too Close," which has a sample in it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:34:13.40" data-timestamp="2053.4"> Oh, here it is. This is another song we were looking at. Normally, we would not go on a song like this because it tends to be a little young. But the bed for the song is from a familiar adult song.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:28.77" data-timestamp="2068.77"> What's the sample that they steal-- use?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:34:31.10" data-timestamp="2071.1"> What is that song?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tony Gray</h4><p begin="00:34:32.20" data-timestamp="2072.2"> You'd have to put it in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:34:36.14" data-timestamp="2076.14"> Oh, here you go. It was a rap song back in-- oh, "Christmas Rappin'" by Kurtis Blow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tony Gray</h4><p begin="00:34:46.44" data-timestamp="2086.44"> Kurtis Blow. Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:34:47.50" data-timestamp="2087.5"> Remember that?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:48.02" data-timestamp="2088.02"> The '80s, sure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:34:52.56" data-timestamp="2092.56"> This is a very familiar sound. If you're in the adult demo, it's not going to make you mad to hear this song because it's just so familiar. You know this song? What is this song?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:04.02" data-timestamp="2104.02"> When they came to V103, Max and Tony made some changes in personnel, they tinkered with the station's slogans and promotions. They paid a marketing firm to call 200,000 women on the phone telling them to listen for a contest on V103. But the main thing, Tony says, the single most important thing that moved them from number five to tied for first place was picking their music more carefully, letting in nothing that did not test well with the target demographic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tony Gray</h4><p begin="00:35:28.22" data-timestamp="2128.22"> A higher degree of discipline. And what, again, my experience has been, a short playlist always seems to fix the problem a lot quicker than, let's say, a more liberal playlist.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:44.79" data-timestamp="2144.79"> When I went to visit V103, I had not been in a commercial radio station for 20 years. And I was curious about what it was going to be like, Chicago's number one station. Turns out it looks exactly like Chicago's public radio station-- same carpet, same fixtures, same office equipment, same phone system. It looked exactly the same, except everyone at V103 had much nicer clothes. And the stereo speakers in Max's office are nicer than the ones in the studio that I speak to you from right now.</p><p begin="00:36:12.33" data-timestamp="2172.33">Tony and Max and I are the same age-- 39 and 40. All three of us started in radio as teenagers Ask them what they love about radio, and they talk about finding unknown songs, putting them on the air, watching them become hits. They talk about the satisfaction of watching the science of radio marketing actually work. And their lives are organized around one moment that happens every month-- the moment they get their numbers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Max Myrick</h4><p begin="00:36:33.25" data-timestamp="2193.25"> It happens every month. I can't sleep the night before the book comes out. I can't do it. I can't sleep. I can't do it. And when I pull them up, I always have my head down. I don't even want to see them. And luckily, we've been at the top of the page. But man--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:55.75" data-timestamp="2215.75"> Running a station the scientific way means, of course, that most radio stations sound the same. It's why most radio is so boring, why we hear the same songs repeated over and over, everywhere on the dial, from city to city, why V103 can't even play Otis Redding. I should note that public radio does not stand above all this. Research has been driving it for years. The jazz played on Chicago's public radio station is audience tested. The classical musical on most stations is audience tested. The most any of us can hope for in this environment is pockets of individuality.</p><p begin="00:37:25.13" data-timestamp="2245.13">And one of the interesting things about V103 is that their format does include pockets of individuality, most notably, the morning show. Tom Joyner, who's syndicated around the country, who does one of the most idiosyncratic, funny, truly interesting radio shows I have ever heard. It jumps quickly from <i>This</i> <i>Day in</i> <i>Black</i> <i>History</i> to the three-minute radio soap opera <i>It's Your World</i>. From serious and semi-serious to straight-out comedy, it is surprising and just great by any measure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Joyner</h4><p begin="00:37:49.11" data-timestamp="2269.11"> So we kind of made a little noise, huh, Mr. Novak?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Novak</h4><p begin="00:37:52.03" data-timestamp="2272.03"> Indeed you did. You've got some power, I would say.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Joyner</h4><p begin="00:37:56.31" data-timestamp="2276.31"> No. No, no, the people, not me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Novak</h4><p begin="00:37:58.32" data-timestamp="2278.32"> The people, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Joyner</h4><p begin="00:37:58.91" data-timestamp="2278.91"> It's not me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:01.87" data-timestamp="2281.87"> A few weeks ago, Joyner and his morning crew took on conservative columnist Robert Novak. This is while President Clinton was in Africa apologizing for slavery. Novak, at the time, said something on television about how African-Americans would not be in the United States if not for slavery. Joyner's show started a barrage of mail to the Chicago newspaper that publishes Novak's syndicated column. And very, very quickly, Novak came onto Joyner's show to try to clarify his position for Joyner's audience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Novak</h4><p begin="00:38:26.69" data-timestamp="2306.69"> Some of our really fine citizens are African-Americans-- in government, in business, athletics and show business. You know how they got here? They were all slaves, weren't they? So it's kind of a problem. We wouldn't have this enrichment of our society if it wasn't for slavery. I never said slavery was a good thing. I said it was an unusual thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Joyner</h4><p begin="00:38:45.12" data-timestamp="2325.12"> Mr. Novak, let me jump in right quick, if I may. When you say it's kind of a problem, the "it's" in that sentence presumably stands for slavery. So if slavery is kind of a problem--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Novak</h4><p begin="00:38:56.36" data-timestamp="2336.36"> No, I didn't mean that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Joyner</h4><p begin="00:38:57.57" data-timestamp="2337.57"> OK, what did you mean by that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Novak</h4><p begin="00:38:58.87" data-timestamp="2338.87"> I meant it's a logical problem that we wouldn't have--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:01.52" data-timestamp="2341.52"> One more thing about the scientific way of making radio-- it is weirdly democratic. Every song is chosen by polling. Here's this multimillion dollar business, all these well-groomed men and women and their expensive clothes spending every hour of every day thinking about how to please middle-aged, inner-city black women. How many other civic institutions are doing that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Novak</h4><p begin="00:39:21.90" data-timestamp="2361.9"> And let me just say one thing, that I'm not in the business of offending people. And I am genuinely sorry if anybody was offended by the remarks I made before or even the remarks I made this morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Joyner</h4><p begin="00:39:33.49" data-timestamp="2373.49"> OK.

It breaks hearts. Lots of people and ideas get knocked off the air as programmers try things they think will more predictably and scientifically attract listeners. Ida Hakkila had a job as a DJ on two big New York rock stations, and she got pushed out for more predictable programming. She began at a station called Z-Rock.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Hakkila</h4><p begin="00:40:09.23" data-timestamp="2409.23"> I was the voice of Z-Rock. And what they'd have me do was-- I was kind of younger. I don't think I'd do it now. But I was the only female voice on the station. So I had to be really, really angry, which isn't the way that I am, personally. So it'd be like, AM 1480 Z-Rock! you know, like I was going to hurt somebody. So sometimes--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:32.75" data-timestamp="2432.75"> And were those instructions to you?

And I think I got paid, like, $5 an hour. And then, at the end of the day, there was a boss that would hear everything. And he'd say, "Could you sound more, I don't know, like a dominatrix?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:58.20" data-timestamp="2458.2"> And at some point, you became a DJ-- a regular DJ on the station, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Hakkila</h4><p begin="00:41:02.02" data-timestamp="2462.02"> Right.

I really love the music. It was AC/DC and Ozzy. And for some reason, the best way to describe it would be to call it butt rock. And the way commercial radio is, there's these very slight parameters.</p><p begin="00:41:30.43" data-timestamp="2490.43">But this guy, as program director, knew that the best thing to do with me was to let me go. The very first shifts that I did were Saturday nights. He'd let me play some of my own records, which was an amazing amount of freedom. I know it doesn't sound like very much, but it was enough space to be a human and to have a lot of fun with the listeners.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:53.88" data-timestamp="2513.88"> So what happened? So how come you're not there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ida Hakkila</h4><p begin="00:41:56.32" data-timestamp="2516.32"> Oh, because in 1996, I guess Viacom could own more than one station, and they decided that they wanted to have a station that appealed to males age 25 to 54.

They were people who were just absolutely beaten. They were reduced to having to say-- I just remember that button one, like, keep your button locked on us. And every day is a no-repeat day.

Yes. I heard before-- long before the film came in-- when I was in New York. A few times, I heard it on a taxi, like when you take a taxi somewhere. At first, I didn't know what the hell this is, but I noticed the taxi driver would crack up, would laugh. And then I would join in, so after that, of course, I heard it many times whenever I could, yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:41.71" data-timestamp="2981.71"> Let me play you a little clip from the Howard Stern Show, OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:49:44.54" data-timestamp="2984.54"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:45.31" data-timestamp="2985.31"> All right, here we go. This is a clip, he's talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:49:47.84" data-timestamp="2987.84"> So I said, Fred, let's go chase Arnold into the bathroom and tell him how great we think it is that he's doing <i>Conan</i> <i>The</i> <i>Barbarian</i>. We went in there and he's like, "What?" [FART NOISES] "Hey, boys." [FART NOISES] "Hey, boys, please. Thank you so much for nice compliment, but please." [FART NOISES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:02.48" data-timestamp="3002.48"> "Sorry to bother you, Arnold." "That's OK, boys."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:50:04.85" data-timestamp="3004.85"> Yeah. Something tells me he gets a little thing on the side going with some girls.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:50:09.99" data-timestamp="3009.99"> Oh, here we go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:50:11.36" data-timestamp="3011.36"> I'm tellling you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:11.74" data-timestamp="3011.74"> "Meet me in my trailer."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:50:12.90" data-timestamp="3012.9"> "Jamie Lee, that was a good strip."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:13.80" data-timestamp="3013.8"> "That was very nice. Now, let's go practice in private. Come here, Rosanne."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:20.51" data-timestamp="3020.51"> So can you imagine that your own radio program in East Timor would go in this kind of direction?</p><p begin="00:50:25.62" data-timestamp="3025.62">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:50:28.11" data-timestamp="3028.11"> Well, I don't know whether I can afford to be exactly like that. Well, they would get me off the air right away. But it is entertaining.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:43.70" data-timestamp="3043.7"> When you imagine what you'd like to do on your radio show, what would you like to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:50:49.15" data-timestamp="3049.15"> The kind of program, the kind of show that would not take people too seriously, like government leaders, politicians.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:02.03" data-timestamp="3062.03"> When you describe it that way, it makes it sound like you'd have mostly a political show. You saw in Howard Stern's movie, <i>Private</i> <i>Parts</i>, he has, like, naked ladies in the studio. Would you do that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:51:12.80" data-timestamp="3072.8"> In our society, in our country, no, I couldn't do that. I don't think you'd find too many women in the Third World that would do that. You have to take into consideration that in certain countries, there are certain things that people are not yet prepared to listen. For instance, if I were to talk about sex the same way <i>Howard</i> <i>Stern</i> <i>Show</i> talks, the bishop would excommunicate me right away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:43.19" data-timestamp="3103.19"> Yes, and I should say, you won the Nobel Peace Prize-- it was a co-award, you and an archbishop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:51:50.72" data-timestamp="3110.72"> Yeah. Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo is an outstanding, courageous individual. And I don't think he would appreciate very much if I were to have a radio program exactly similar to Howard Stern when it comes to discussing sex.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:09.10" data-timestamp="3129.1"> And let me ask you to explain, what's so appealing to you about Howard Stern?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:52:12.93" data-timestamp="3132.93"> Well, he challenges all the hypocrisy, the snobism, the double standards. He says things, he does things that most people would want to do and to say but that they don't dare.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:30.68" data-timestamp="3150.68"> You know, when you describe his program the way you do, it sounds that, in a way, it's almost a diplomat's dream. A diplomat can't usually say exactly what's on their mind, and here, you have a radio personality who gets to say exactly what he wants.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:52:43.76" data-timestamp="3163.76"> Exactly. Many diplomats feel like I do. You get frustrated with all this posturing at the United Nations. And sometimes, I lose my temper and I tell some people what I actually think of them. And if I were not constrained by the delicate work I do, if I were to have my own radio program, I tell you, I would be almost exactly like Howard Stern.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:53:13.71" data-timestamp="3193.71"> We don't believe you. Flat out don't--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:53:15.59" data-timestamp="3195.59"> I don't really care what you believe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:53:18.09" data-timestamp="3198.09"> I don't believe it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:53:18.79" data-timestamp="3198.79"> I think that Mark has a radar in his pants for money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:53:23.25" data-timestamp="3203.25"> Yep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:24.28" data-timestamp="3204.28"> Do you think there are many members of the diplomatic corps who listen to Howard Stern and are fans?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:53:28.25" data-timestamp="3208.25"> Oh, yes, yes. People have fun. They enjoy it. Most of them feel, well, that's exactly what I would like to say myself.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:43.34" data-timestamp="3223.34"> And if only I could have a job where I were able to speak honestly like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:53:47.56" data-timestamp="3227.56"> Exactly. Yes, yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:49.44" data-timestamp="3229.44"> Now, over the last few weeks, knowing that we were going to do this interview, we've been trying to arrange to get you onto <i>The</i> <i>Howard</i> <i>Stern</i> <i>Show</i> so you could take a look firsthand at your potential new career. And we haven't been successful so far. And I understand that at one point, you were in contact with them. You called them up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:54:06.80" data-timestamp="3246.8"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:07.74" data-timestamp="3247.74"> Can you tell me what happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:54:09.76" data-timestamp="3249.76"> Well, first, the lady had no idea what I was talking about. I told her East Timor. She said, East what? She probably thought I was calling from the East Side in New York. After, I tried to explain-- she even didn't know what the Nobel Peace Prize is all about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:29.79" data-timestamp="3269.79"> She had never heard of the Nobel Peace Prize?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:54:31.52" data-timestamp="3271.52"> No. and then she pass on to the editors or the producer, whoever. And they say they don't know what you're talking about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:42.97" data-timestamp="3282.97"> Yeah. I'm going to play you one more clip. This is also from <i>The</i> <i>Howard Stern Show.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Caller</h4><p begin="00:54:47.22" data-timestamp="3287.22"> Morning, Howard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:54:48.32" data-timestamp="3288.32"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Caller</h4><p begin="00:54:49.04" data-timestamp="3289.04"> I'm interested in the porno cruise contest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Stern</h4><p begin="00:54:52.16" data-timestamp="3292.16"> All right, listen. This is the ultimate prize. It's a porno cruise. It's like 70 hot chicks who are going to be naked the entire time, filming porno. They're going to be poolside. It's a cruise, a legitimate cruise, and we've got two tickets to give away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:07.03" data-timestamp="3307.03"> In other words, they're having a cruise, and it's going to be all porno actresses. And they're giving away tickets to it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:55:14.22" data-timestamp="3314.22"> But that again, is a joke, no?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:17.11" data-timestamp="3317.11"> No, I think it's real.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:55:18.49" data-timestamp="3318.49"> It's real?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:19.00" data-timestamp="3319"> I think it's real.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:55:22.65" data-timestamp="3322.65"> Well, OK, if it's a joke to joke people, I would. Many, many years ago, when I was a journalist back in Timor, on April Fools Day, I ran a story saying that a Swedish cruise vessel had ran aground not far from the capital, and there were many blond, nice, Swedish women around. And I tell you, everybody, including some very respectable men, they all rushed there. And all there was when they got there, there I was, waiting for them. There was no boat, no Swedish women.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:11.79" data-timestamp="3371.79"> You were ahead of your time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:56:16.64" data-timestamp="3376.64"> Thank you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:18.42" data-timestamp="3378.42"> In a certain way-- you're trying to get freedom for your homeland-- do you view this kind of speech, which, I have to say, Howard Stern is often criticized here in the States for the things he says and the way he is. Do you view this as being, in a certain way, what freedom is all about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jose Ramos-horta</h4><p begin="00:56:34.35" data-timestamp="3394.35"> Yes, obviously, that is freedom. It is irreverent, but it is freedom. It is honesty. And that's why it is so popular and many people hate him because of that. But he should, in fact, receive a medal of freedom for what he's doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:59.81" data-timestamp="3419.81"> Jose Ramos-Horta in Geneva.</p></div> </div>
