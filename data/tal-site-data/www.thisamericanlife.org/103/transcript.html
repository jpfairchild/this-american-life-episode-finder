<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.37" data-timestamp="0.37">Before he got sick, he pictured the world this way. There are the people who are healthy, like him, and people who are sick, other people. And unconsciously, as we all do, he drew a line between the two groups, the two countries. Then when Paul Cowan was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, he was struck with the fact that these are not, of course, two different populations, the sick and the healthy. Instead he wrote, "The world is composed of the sick and the not yet sick."</p><p begin="00:00:29.43" data-timestamp="29.43">He published an account of his illness in <i>The</i> <i>Village</i> <i>Voice.</i> "I want to describe some of what I've seen during the voyage I've made, the journey from being a person who took his health for granted to one who's trying to survive a life-threatening illness. I want to chart some of this wilderness for others who will be here one day." Well, that's the mission of today's radio program, because all of us, you and me both, if we're lucky, if we don't die when we're young, this is where we're heading, heart disease, cancer. Men have a one in two lifetime chance of getting cancer. For women, it's one in three. If you're a man hearing the sound of my voice right now, I want you to look at yourself for a moment. It's you or me, man. Odds are one of us will get it. Or we'll both get it. Two other guys will go off scot-free.</p><p begin="00:01:25.81" data-timestamp="85.81">So let us chart this terrain where, if we all live long enough, we will be entering. Cowan writes, "During the past five months, I've learned that there's a land of the sick. When you receive a passport, an unwelcome diagnosis, you learn that the land has its own language-- medical terminology-- its own geography-- hospitals, outpatient clinics, blood testing labs, doctors' offices-- its own citizens-- other sick people-- its own pantheon of heroes and authority figures-- doctors, medical researchers, hospital administrators-- its own calendar dictated by the changes in one's body or by the results of medical tests."</p><p begin="00:02:02.59" data-timestamp="122.59">When you're well, it's hard to remember what it's like to be sick. And after just a brief time in the hospital, Cowan found it hard to remember what it was like for him just weeks before to be active and self-sufficient. His picture of himself changed. He struggled to retain ties to the land of the healthy, to see himself as an exile who would return one day. But he did not return.</p><p begin="00:02:30.11" data-timestamp="150.11">Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Most weeks, of course, we bring you a variety of different stories on some theme. Today we bring you just one story about one person's journey from the world of healthy people into the world of sick ones. Today on our program, Scenes from a Transplant.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Scenes from a Transplant</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.63" data-timestamp="174.63">In 1995, Rebecca Perl had a new baby boy that she and her partner, Tom, named Griffin. She was a health science reporter with National Public Radio in Washington, D.C., where she'd just won a Peabody Award for an investigative series about the tobacco industry. She did a lot of stories about doctors and medicine. Then she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and entered the medical world as a patient. She had six months of radiation and chemotherapy. It didn't work. So in the winter of 1996, as a last attempt to save her life, she and Tom traveled from their home in Maryland to Omaha, Nebraska, to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for a bone marrow transplant and another round of chemotherapy, a round of chemotherapy as much as 10 times stronger than the original. Dan Collison, a friend of theirs and a radio producer, went with them, and he documented what happened. He also interviewed Rebecca a year later. This is her story.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:03:51.89" data-timestamp="231.89">Daddy and Dan and I are going away, Griffy, for a little. We're going on a trip. You're going to stay with Grandpa and Grandma, with Pop-Pop and Grandma, OK?</p><p begin="00:04:04.29" data-timestamp="244.29">Sometimes I worry that Griffin's going to fall in love with some woman who just lays in bed all the time because that's what he sees his mother doing in the first two years of his life. I mean, he's going to fall in love with some woman who lies in bed and eats bonbons or something, or reads or something, because that seems to be what I'm turning into is this person who lies in bed all the time. Or else I lie on the couch and read him books or something.</p><p begin="00:04:29.41" data-timestamp="269.41">"Once there were three baby owls, Sarah, Percy, and Bill. They lived in a hole in the trunk of a tree with their mother owl. The hole had twigs and leaves and owl feathers in it. It was their house. One night they woke up and their mother owl was gone. 'Where's Mommy?' said Sarah. 'Oh, my goodness,' said Percy. 'I want my mommy,' said Bill."</p><p begin="00:04:53.25" data-timestamp="293.25">He really likes the owl book, and it makes him feel better that in the owl book, the mommy owl goes away but then she comes back. So I think he understands that. And lots of mothers go away on trips and go off for work for weeks at a time. And I've had to do that. Now the really bad one is I'm going to have to go away for a month or more. And he'll hopefully come visit. But still, it's going to be a really long time. I mean, it happens. And I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that he can have a mother.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:05:28.17" data-timestamp="328.17">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:05:28.82" data-timestamp="328.82">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:05:30.74" data-timestamp="330.74">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:05:32.18" data-timestamp="332.18">Bye bye, Griffy.

First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he's supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don't think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I'm a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they're affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:30.91" data-timestamp="450.91">And they're off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:07:34.69" data-timestamp="454.69">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:35.99" data-timestamp="455.99">OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:07:38.98" data-timestamp="458.98">Maybe it was a little crazy to drive all the way to Omaha in the dead of winter, but I hate to fly, and Tom likes road trips. I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at The Waffle House.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:55.71" data-timestamp="475.71">We're in the bathroom of The Waffle House. Did you lock the door?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:07:59.26" data-timestamp="479.26">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:59.57" data-timestamp="479.57">And I'm going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It's just like being a heroine addict.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:05.17" data-timestamp="485.17">For me, it was the worst part, having to give myself shots. For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:08:14.50" data-timestamp="494.5">And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn't. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that's it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I'd do it at like 7:25, right before <i>Seinfeld</i>. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I'd miss <i>Seinfeld</i>. So I'd hurry myself along. Now I'm doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House.

Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It's the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ruth Kessinger</h4><p begin="00:21:02.69" data-timestamp="1262.69">The machine empties the cells into a very important, special bag. We take the bag of cells to the laboratory. And in the laboratory, we freeze them in a liquid nitrogen freezer and save them there. Then the patient can go get his or her high-dose therapy. The high-dose therapy, of course, is intended to kill tumor cells. But the doses are so high that it also hurts the bone marrow. And that's the reason you need to give the stem cells back to the patient so they can grow a new bone marrow.</p><p begin="00:21:41.21" data-timestamp="1301.21">So as soon as the high-dose therapy is finished, and hopefully the cancer is finished too-- it's been killed-- then we get the cells out of the freezer. We thaw them, and we simply inject them back into the bloodstream of the patient. And like a miracle, these stem cells know where to go. They home right to the empty bone marrow space and begin to grow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 9</h4><p begin="00:22:05.67" data-timestamp="1325.67">Hi, can I help you?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:22:06.71" data-timestamp="1326.71">Hi, I'm supposed to be admitted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 9</h4><p begin="00:22:08.69" data-timestamp="1328.69">Oh, OK.

And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird.

I was trying to reach Lorraine Brazier. I'm a friend of hers, and I was on the unit myself. Rebecca Perl. And I was just trying to find out about Graham. He's not in the room anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:51:07.72" data-timestamp="3067.72">February 3. I've been home four days when I call back to Omaha to see how Graham is doing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:51:14.22" data-timestamp="3074.22">This morning. Did they just take him off the respirator? They didn't. He just-- he wasn't breathing. Oh. Oh, gosh.</p><p begin="00:51:29.16" data-timestamp="3089.16">So weird. I mean, this isn't what you expect, you know? I mean, it's rare that people die from the bone marrow transplant, but I guess it happens. But it's rare when you get your own cells. I don't know. I just feel sorry for Lorraine. Because she's got two little kids. One is just one year old, and one is eight years old. That's a lot. And it's just a lot that they won't have a father.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:52:18.42" data-timestamp="3138.42">Springtime. The buds on the maple tree outside our bedroom window have begun to sprout, and so has my hair. I call this tree my hair tree because since I've been having chemo, my hair has fallen out and grown back at the same time the tree has lost its leaves and sprouted new ones.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 12</h4><p begin="00:52:41.39" data-timestamp="3161.39">Welcome to Omaha's Eppley Airfield.

Three months have gone by, and we're back in Omaha. It's tax day and the day I find out if my transplant worked. This time we're only here for two days, and Griffin is with us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:53:04.69" data-timestamp="3184.69">That's Dr. Vose.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:05.68" data-timestamp="3185.68">Who is this?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:07.17" data-timestamp="3187.17">That's Griffin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:08.06" data-timestamp="3188.06">How you doing? You taking good care of mom?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:12.16" data-timestamp="3192.16">The news is good. Dr. Vose tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:16.77" data-timestamp="3196.77">CAT scan looked really good. They said that the mass was shrinking from where it was. Last time we checked in, it was two by one. That's pretty close to being what we would consider normal size for a lymph node. So it's definitely a lot smaller. It's hard to know for sure if it's completely gone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:30.76" data-timestamp="3210.76">It's definitely not smaller?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:31.54" data-timestamp="3211.54">A lot smaller. A lot smaller.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:34.13" data-timestamp="3214.13">Oh, OK. Well, that's good. Yeah, thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:37.97" data-timestamp="3217.97">Yeah, well, you did all the work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:40.75" data-timestamp="3220.75">I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it's possible that what we're seeing, the reason it's somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there's scar tissue. So hopefully that's what it is and we're OK. And so that's nice. It's good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air. We need that music. [SINGING] You might just make it after all.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:54:36.01" data-timestamp="3276.01">It's funny when you realize you're going to get your life back, that your job isn't just fighting a disease anymore. Suddenly you have to live. Egad. You can't just sit around and wait to be better. You've got to go back to work or at least do something. Study biology, write a book. That was very strange and difficult for me at first, because for the past year and a half, I'd been doing very little. Reading, resting, looking through catalogs. I was scared to go back to work, to face getting dressed every day, to be busy, on deadline, frantic, to let my orderly life and my time with Griffin get away from me.</p><p begin="00:55:14.69" data-timestamp="3314.69">One year since my transplant. The tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease is gone. I'm back at work, but my energy is still low. I'm tired a lot, and when Griffin gets sick with a cold, I get sick too. And I get it bad. Still, we go on vacation. Tom and I went to Rome this fall. We see friends, make dinner. We even fight. And though my life is pretty good, I don't feel ecstatic, but I feel content. And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:55:57.27" data-timestamp="3357.27">Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who's the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don't go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I'm really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn't matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven't changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven't changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won't.</p></div> </div>
