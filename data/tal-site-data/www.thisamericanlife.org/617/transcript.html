<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.94" data-timestamp="0.94"> So are you thinking about this a lot??</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:03.48" data-timestamp="3.48"> I got sad about it on the training again this morning. It comes at totally random moments, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:08.18" data-timestamp="8.18"> That's David Kestenbaum, one of the producers of our program. And to understand what he's been sad about, I think it's not going to make any sense unless you know that he's a physicist. He has a PhD in particle physics.</p><p begin="00:00:20.05" data-timestamp="20.05">He was on one of the teams that discovered the top quark at Fermilab back in the '90s, before he became a journalist. So he thinks like a scientist. And he recently stumbled across a story he'd never heard before about Enrico Fermi, the physicist that Fermilab is actually named for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:35.46" data-timestamp="35.46"> So the story goes that this is 1950. Fermi's visiting Los Alamos.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.03" data-timestamp="41.03"> Los Alamos, where they developed the atomic bomb?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:44.17" data-timestamp="44.17"> Yeah. And they're sitting around at lunch. It's Fermi and a handful of other physicists and they start talking about extraterrestrials.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:52.49" data-timestamp="52.49"> One of the scientists who was there remembers that they talked about some New Yorker cartoon, which had flying saucers and cheerful aliens stealing our trash cans. They joked about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:01.95" data-timestamp="61.95"> And then out of nowhere, Fermi says something like, so where are they?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.59" data-timestamp="66.59"> Meaning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:08.59" data-timestamp="68.59"> The aliens.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:09.72" data-timestamp="69.72"> And did people know what he meant?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:11.79" data-timestamp="71.79"> Yeah, somehow everybody knew exactly what he meant. The idea was basically that, like, the galaxy is this huge place, right? Hundreds of billions of stars. It's been around for billions of years. If you believe that intelligent life is something that just arises given enough time, where is everybody?</p><p begin="00:01:32.79" data-timestamp="92.79">Like, there have been billions of years, where civilizations could have developed and become way more advanced than we are and traveled from star to star, sent signals or something. Where are they? If that's right, where are they?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:48.24" data-timestamp="108.24"> This question became known as the Fermi Paradox, which goes like this. If it's so likely that intelligent life exists elsewhere, where is it? Why hasn't anybody shown up? And of course, the simple answer to that would be, well, nobody else exists.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:03.58" data-timestamp="123.58"> And I had never thought-- it made me think, maybe we're alone. I really thought that for the first time. Yeah, it made me really sad.</p><p begin="00:02:17.95" data-timestamp="137.95">I had never thought about it seriously before. I had always assumed that life was everywhere. But he's making a really serious point here. He's raising a tough question.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:28.52" data-timestamp="148.52"> So for months now, when David's brushing his teeth or doing nothing in particular, it'll hit him again. Maybe we're alone in the universe. Like this morning, on the train.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:39.87" data-timestamp="159.87"> The specific thought I was having was that this would mean that there's nobody out there who knows more than we do, like, about science, about-- there are no better songs. There are no better books. This is it, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:57.69" data-timestamp="177.69"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:58.66" data-timestamp="178.66"> Like, what we know is it. What we are is it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:04.32" data-timestamp="184.32"> Why is your response to this sadness?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:11.17" data-timestamp="191.17"> Why is your response not sadness? Of course that's sad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:17.26" data-timestamp="197.26"> This whole thing reminds me of just a really, really old Woody Allen movie-- it might be Annie Hall-- where there's a scene of him as a kid. And he's saying to some adult-- she's saying, why didn't you do your homework or something like that. And he's like, well, because the universe is expanding.</p><p begin="00:03:36.57" data-timestamp="216.57">And then the adult is like, why is that any of your business? And that's my question for you. Why is it any of your business?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:44.95" data-timestamp="224.95"> Oh, I totally read that the other way. I was like, he's making a serious point. Why is no one listening to him?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.07" data-timestamp="232.07"> Oh.</p><p begin="00:03:52.86" data-timestamp="232.86">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:53.23" data-timestamp="233.23"> See, that's the problem. I'm in his shoes and I'm not making a joke. I feel like if you were able to really imagine it, it would make you sad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:11.21" data-timestamp="251.21"> Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:12.72" data-timestamp="252.72"> Yeah. When you look up at the stars, do you think about what they are, and the distances and stuff, and all that?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:22.68" data-timestamp="262.68"> No, not in a deep way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:24.03" data-timestamp="264.03"> I mean, it's so easy not to feel anything. But it's a crazy thing you're looking at, just how small we are and how big it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:33.47" data-timestamp="273.47"> David tried to explain the feeling that he was having to me in a bunch of different ways. And the explanation that made the most sense to me was when he told me that he'd been looking at videos with his five-year-old son, Augie, who's really into space. Videos of the Apollo moon missions, with astronauts happily bouncing around on the lunar surface and driving in that moonbuggy they had. And David found himself just looking at where they were, really looking at the moon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:00.29" data-timestamp="300.29"> Oh, look how dead it is. There is nothing there. The moon is just this dusty, awful rock. And what if it's like that everywhere.</p><p begin="00:05:10.84" data-timestamp="310.84">You know, liquid methane oceans and whatever rocks, but no life at all. What if that's the rest of the galaxy? Space just seemed like some horrible, awful, dangerous place to me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:22.99" data-timestamp="322.99"> I see that. There's no hope. It's just death out there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:26.32" data-timestamp="326.32"> It's a lot of pressure if we're the only thing going on. It's a lonely thought.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:32.48" data-timestamp="332.48"> I first found out that David was thinking about all this at our staff story meeting a couple of weeks ago. And I'll be honest, when he told everybody that he was upset about the Fermi Paradox, we all laughed at him. Like OK, that's what's upsetting you? Which he gets, but it doesn't help him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:51.38" data-timestamp="351.38"> I can't find anyone to really talk it through with.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:55.27" data-timestamp="355.27"> Because none of us took it seriously?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:57.86" data-timestamp="357.86"> Yeah. I feel like when I say it, people are like, yeah, I don't know, or I always thought that. The thing that bugs me about it is he's making a real scientific argument. I wanted to talk through the science of it with somebody. It's not just a "what do you think? I bet you they're there. I bet you they're not there." He's making up a physics point, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:16.51" data-timestamp="376.51"> Well, today on our radio program, stories from the one civilization we know does exist, stories of people who head out on missions here on our own planet to vanquish their own loneliness. We hear from a 9-year-old girl, a married couple, and of course, David. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:42.98" data-timestamp="402.98">Act 1, "I Think We're Alone Now." So none of us would satisfyingly engage our coworker, David Kestenbaum, about Fermi's paradox. He needed a physicist to talk to to help him figure out what to think.</p><p begin="00:06:57.46" data-timestamp="417.46">So he went to talk to one of his old physics professors from when he got his PhD at Harvard. Her name is Melissa Franklin. Her specialty is particle physics. Here's what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:07:05.92" data-timestamp="425.92"> I went to see Melissa because I figured for sure she would understand.

<h3>Act Two: Two Can Be as Sad as One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:48.84" data-timestamp="1368.84">It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, Fermi's Paradox. We have stories of people heading out on their own on very personal quest to figure out are we alone? We've arrived at Act 2 of our program. Act 2, "Two Can Be as Sad as One."</p><p begin="00:23:02.92" data-timestamp="1382.92">We're in this show about loneliness. We now turn to one of the loneliest experiences a person can possibly have, and that's marriage. I think the thing that I was least prepared for in marriage is how lonely it can be, when things go badly, I mean. And there's this recording of this couple trying to get past all the stuff that's dividing them that I think illustrates really well how hard that can be and what it really means to do it.</p><p begin="00:23:26.17" data-timestamp="1406.17">This recording is from this new podcast in which a real-life therapist records her real-life sessions with real couples who've agreed to be recorded. The therapist is Esther Perel, who's also the author of the books Mating in Captivity and the upcoming, The State of Affairs.</p><p begin="00:23:40.67" data-timestamp="1420.67">I've listened to a few episodes of her podcast now, and OK, my mom was a marriage therapist. She wrote a book about her techniques and research. She did trainings for other therapists. I've been in couples counseling myself with my wife. So I know about this world, and I found listening to Perel to be completely fascinating.</p><p begin="00:23:59.10" data-timestamp="1439.1">She's a very active therapist. I think that's the best way to say it. She talks a ton, takes what the couple says to her and then says it back to them in this way where it's like she's a LeBron-level basketball player, passing the ball to them, and then urging them down the court, running alongside, and shouting encouragement and instructions and very occasional razzing along the way. She's such an intense listener that it makes interviewing her a very odd experience. I tried to explain this to her after she and I had been sitting in the studio together for over an hour.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:27.10" data-timestamp="1467.1"> I rarely am interviewing somebody-- I'm not sure if I've ever interviewed somebody who's watching me as much as I'm watching them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:24:34.91" data-timestamp="1474.91"> Yes, especially when your throat chokes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:38.72" data-timestamp="1478.72"> When my throat chokes?

Apparently, very revealing. The therapy session that I found so interesting, and all the sessions in her podcast, are a kind of session that Perel does a lot of.</p><p begin="00:25:03.84" data-timestamp="1503.84">She does these consultations where instead of people coming in week after week, like normal therapy, a couple will come in just one time, for two or three hours. And then that's it. No more therapy. People fly in from all over for this. Perel only takes couples whose problems she thinks she can make a dent in in so little time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:22.21" data-timestamp="1522.21"> And what can you accomplish in a two or three-hour session, where you see the people once?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:25:27.94" data-timestamp="1527.94"> So much. The story that the people come in with is not the story they leave with.

Can they have a different kind of connection, a different kind of experience of themselves and with each other in the room?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:55.18" data-timestamp="1555.18"> And with most of the couples, can you get them to that point? That seems very advanced.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:25:59.82" data-timestamp="1559.82"> Not necessarily. I mean, with many.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:04.71" data-timestamp="1564.71"> It can make for suspenseful listening, hearing her try to get couples to that point. This particular couple came into her office on a Wednesday morning this fall and sat on the couch together. They'd been married for nearly 40 years, middle class people. They met when the woman was just 15. They have children and grandchildren.</p><p begin="00:26:22.77" data-timestamp="1582.77">And then, three years ago, the wife discovered that her husband had been cheating on her. Not just like with one person for a few months or a few years, but widely and compulsively for most of their marriage. I mean, for decades. These were one-night stands and paying for sex, he said.</p><p begin="00:26:41.16" data-timestamp="1601.16">They both said they'd been happy together all those years in the marriage with a good sex life, and she wanted to stay together if it was at all possible because she wanted to keep what they'd had that was good. But you know, being lied to for decades, it's like it robbed her of her past. She couldn't tell what was real, what to trust. She told Perel in the session.</p><p begin="00:27:00.76" data-timestamp="1620.76">[AUDIO PLAYBACK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:27:01.41" data-timestamp="1621.41"> So yeah, I mean, we had a good marriage and that's why I'm still here. I mean, he was a good husband. He was the best father ever, always there with our children, always loving to me.</p><p begin="00:27:14.46" data-timestamp="1634.46">And I don't doubt for one second that he didn't love me with all of his heart. I never knew anything was wrong. And I don't want to say I'm one of those women who lived in a tunnel without any peripheral vision.</p><p begin="00:27:35.35" data-timestamp="1655.35">If something came up, I'd question him, and he'd tell me the story and I'd believe him. Why not believe him? He's never done anything to cause me to mistrust him. Now I look at him, and if he tells me this pen is red, I will turn it 15 different ways today. And that's a huge issue for us now.</p><p begin="00:27:55.88" data-timestamp="1675.88">[END PLAYBACK]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:56.78" data-timestamp="1676.78"> They spend a little bit of time in the session, not a lot, really, on what might have led him into this double life. He grew up in a violent home, saw his mother regularly beaten by his dad, was beaten himself, and witnessed way more than he could absorb or handle as a kid.</p><p begin="00:28:12.33" data-timestamp="1692.33">Perel tells him there are lots of boys who go through that, and then grow up, split their personalities in half, like he'd done, treat women one way when they were away from home, and then be super responsible with their families when they are home. He seems kind of wrecked in the recording. It's only now that he was finally facing the truth about what he'd done and who he'd been.</p><p begin="00:28:30.87" data-timestamp="1710.87">[AUDIO PLAYBACK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:28:32.54" data-timestamp="1712.54"> I've wasted 59 years living a mask, living a dual life.

He said he was happy. He said he didn't love any of these women.</p><p begin="00:29:10.11" data-timestamp="1750.11">And his wife was trying to believe him, that this was a compulsion that had nothing to do with her. But she was also struggling with the fact that her friends and relatives could not understand why she was staying with him after everything he'd done. They judged her, even her own daughter.</p><p begin="00:29:24.76" data-timestamp="1764.76">[AUDIO PLAYBACK]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:29:25.06" data-timestamp="1765.06"> And is she mad at you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:29:26.46" data-timestamp="1766.46"> Yeah, she was very mad at me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:29:28.82" data-timestamp="1768.82"> For not throwing him out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:29:30.17" data-timestamp="1770.17"> Well, I did throw him out, but for not ending it. Yeah, they thought I was weak. They thought I had Stockholm Syndrome. They felt I-- you know, because we've been together so long, they just felt that I was too weak in character. And they didn't like what they saw.</p><p begin="00:29:47.74" data-timestamp="1787.74">[END PLAYBACK]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:48.20" data-timestamp="1788.2"> Perel told me that it was seeing the wife's isolation that made her realize what it was that she wanted to accomplish in this session.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:29:55.44" data-timestamp="1795.44"> She's decided to stay, and she needs a dignified way, a way with self-respect, to feel that her choice is valid. But in order for it to be valid, she needs something from him that I sense she has yet to receive, that he is struggling to give her. And it's that button that I choose to focus on during the session.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:21.72" data-timestamp="1821.72"> And what is the thing that she needs from him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Perel</h4><p begin="00:30:23.83" data-timestamp="1823.83"> She needs a degree of accountability and recognition about the pain that he caused her. But now he's so busy with his own pain that he has a hard time owning the hurt that he caused her. So he feels so bad about himself, that he can't feel bad for her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:46.66" data-timestamp="1846.66"> So a lot of the session is Perel trying to get the husband to understand and acknowledge his wife's pain, and I'm going to play a stretch of this now that's several minutes long from the therapy session, starting from when Perel first brings this up. And what you hear is this very human thing I think all of us in relationships have done. He's not able to take in what they're saying to him at first.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:35.62" data-timestamp="2615.62">Act 3, "Rosie's Paradox." So we end our show today with the story of one more person asking some very big questions. Stephanie Foo explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:43:50.24" data-timestamp="2630.24"> About three years ago, my friend Matt's older daughter went through one of those hardcore phases where she got really into asking her dad a lot of questions. She was nine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:44:00.57" data-timestamp="2640.57"> There's the why phase. And then the why phase can turn into the why not and explain and that endless string of questions. Like, why can't I have my own room? How do I get to school? Why can't we have a yard? Can I have a cookie? They're unrelenting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:44:18.28" data-timestamp="2658.28"> So one night, Matt was working from home and Rosie was bugging him with her questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:44:23.62" data-timestamp="2663.62"> And it was just one after the other after the other. And I was like, look, you've got to get just give me a minute. I'm working right now. Just go off and write them all down. Make me a list of the questions that you want me to answer, and I'll answer them for you.</p><p begin="00:44:39.46" data-timestamp="2679.46">I thought it was going to be like three or four questions and then a picture of a rabbit or something. And I get this list and I look at it. And these are the essential, unanswerable questions of life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:44:54.66" data-timestamp="2694.66"> Read a few of these questions for me. Start at the very top.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:44:59.09" data-timestamp="2699.09"> OK, so, what is life? Why?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:45:02.05" data-timestamp="2702.05"> That's the first question.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:45:03.62" data-timestamp="2703.62"> It's the first question. It's the first thing she wants to know. Where do we go when we die? heaven? Explain. Another planet? Is heaven another planet?</p><p begin="00:45:14.13" data-timestamp="2714.13">Why is there heaven or hell? Time? Why? Explain. Do we make worlds? Do we become like God? Why?</p><p begin="00:45:26.73" data-timestamp="2726.73">Why do you do what you do? How do you know what's true? Who do you miss? Why? Explain. Do you miss anyone more than them, and does that change and how? And if that changes, was it worth missing them in the first place?</p><p begin="00:45:41.56" data-timestamp="2741.56">And my favorite is-- and this is pretty much just my jaw dropped, why any of this? I mean, my first reaction to them is-- I mean, I'm proud of her. And then I realize I actually have to answer these questions, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:00.41" data-timestamp="2760.41"> They're are about three pages, single-spaced, of handwritten questions, about 50 questions total. But a promise was a promise, so Matt got to work. He's a professor at West Point, teaches writing. And so he took a professorial approach to it and started researching answers for her, looking up quotes on each topic, spending weeks, sometimes months, writing each answer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:23.88" data-timestamp="2783.88"> What's the shortest and what's the longest you've ever spent? And what's the hardest one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:46:28.58" data-timestamp="2788.58"> So I think the longest one is one that I haven't finished answering for her yet, which is, what is love?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:34.32" data-timestamp="2794.32"> What's been the easiest one to answer so far?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:46:36.83" data-timestamp="2796.83"> Is heaven another planet? No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:44.45" data-timestamp="2804.45"> I got him to read me one of the answers he worked hardest on, the answer to, "Time. Why? Explain."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:46:52.19" data-timestamp="2812.19"> Could you read it for me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:46:54.53" data-timestamp="2814.53"> Sure. "So tell me what and tell me why, and the burden is on me to justify this to you. Perhaps that's what time means in the end is a justification or a lack of being justified. And I don't really know what "justification" means.

Rosie was nine. All his answers are like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:47:21.55" data-timestamp="2841.55"> "Kierkegaard gets to this point after either/oring everything. He says, why did I not die as a baby?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:47:27.88" data-timestamp="2847.88"> I'm a grown-up and I find it impossible to follow your answers. Honestly, I have not any idea what you're saying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:47:39.25" data-timestamp="2859.25"> Yeah. I mean, I really don't understand half of what I just said either, right? To be honest.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:47:46.02" data-timestamp="2866.02"> What his answers do have going for them is sincerity. The time one ends like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:47:53.87" data-timestamp="2873.87"> "And one of my favorite stories by a guy named William Faulkner. There was a daddy who gives his kid a watch and says, "I give you this watch, not that you might remember time, but so that you might forget it for a little while." I can only tell you that time is me turning and turning while the world is turning around a star that turns around a center that turns around the whole time. Among all the other things and the little turning animals and all the little turning worlds, there's me trying to turn to you."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:26.31" data-timestamp="2906.31"> OK. And you just told her this answer like this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:48:31.14" data-timestamp="2911.14"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:32.69" data-timestamp="2912.69"> And she?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:48:33.76" data-timestamp="2913.76"> I mean, she would pass in and out of being interested in it. And at the end of it, she was just like, oh, yeah. OK.</p><p begin="00:48:43.67" data-timestamp="2923.67">And I'm like, all right, well, I mean, do you see what I'm saying about time? It's a measurement of change. It's an arbitrary human construct, but not, but it feels different. It's this phenomenon. She's like, yeah, yeah, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:48:57.64" data-timestamp="2937.64"> I was like, oh. Well, this isn't really exactly what I wanted.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:02.35" data-timestamp="2942.35"> That's not what you wanted because you were like, oh, this is kind of boring?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:49:05.77" data-timestamp="2945.77"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:06.49" data-timestamp="2946.49"> Rosie has a pixie cut and a cheeky grin. She gave her dad the 50 questions three years ago. She's 12 now. He's been working on getting her answers, but he's only gone through 2/3 of them because it takes him so long to cobble together a response. What I found out talking to Rosie is she didn't even really care about the answers to these questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:49:26.83" data-timestamp="2966.83"> Questions that I thought that would take him a long time to answer, because at the time I really just wanted to talk to him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:33.12" data-timestamp="2973.12"> It all started when she first moved to New York City. Before then, she'd been living with her mom and grandparents most of the week. But then her grandpa, who she was really close to, died, and she had to move in with her dad during the week instead. At the same time, she started at a new school, where the kids either ignored or bullied her, and she felt lost. One day, she came home from school and decided she needed to do something about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:49:57.25" data-timestamp="2997.25"> I was lonely. And I felt a little sad that nobody had really stepped out to say, oh, hey. It's gonna be OK. I'll be your friend. So that's when I really, really needed somebody to talk to.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:13.93" data-timestamp="3013.93"> So you didn't have anybody to talk to at school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:16.12" data-timestamp="3016.12"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:17.12" data-timestamp="3017.12"> And then at home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:18.82" data-timestamp="3018.82"> No. That's really why I felt like, oh, this is my dad. He's a really important person. I love him very much. I really want to become closer with him. I wish there was something that I could do to make us closer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:31.78" data-timestamp="3031.78"> Did you feel like your dad wasn't paying enough attention to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:35.83" data-timestamp="3035.83"> Yeah, a little bit. Or not a little bit. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:39.79" data-timestamp="3039.79"> What was he doing instead?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:50:41.37" data-timestamp="3041.37"> He was writing papers on his computer. And I knew at the time how important it was, but part of me still wished that-- like, put down all the screens. Put down everything else and just talk.</p><p begin="00:50:58.73" data-timestamp="3058.73">So I wrote all the questions down, and they were big questions because I know my dad. And if it's a little question, he'll elaborate on it, and he'll make it a big deal. So if you times that by a big, complex question, that would be a huge talk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:19.40" data-timestamp="3079.4"> Is it true that you weren't talking to her much at the time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:51:23.22" data-timestamp="3083.22"> No, I think I was talking to her all the time. You know, I would tell it was time to get up and go to school. I would tell her that it was time to do her homework. I would tell her that she needed a new jacket. Yeah, I mean, I talked to you all the time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:38.14" data-timestamp="3098.14"> Maybe you're noticing the purely logistical nature of everything he mentioned? It certainly didn't get past Rosie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:51:44.65" data-timestamp="3104.65"> I talked to you all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:51:46.69" data-timestamp="3106.69"> Yeah, but to me, it's not really the same thing. So a conversation and talking are completely different things. Talking could be a range from, oh, hey, what's up? And conversation is you're deep in thought and you're looking, and you're making eye contact, and you're really enjoying the presence of somebody else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:06.09" data-timestamp="3126.09"> Rosie's a smart kid, yeah, but this is the thing I really admire about her. Matt was a single dad with two kids, going to school and trying to make the rent at the same time. Telling him to pay attention to her didn't cut it, so she figured out something else.</p><p begin="00:52:25.87" data-timestamp="3145.87">I read this short story recently about a successful con man, whose motto was, "make them want to give you the thing you want to take." Rosie made her dad want to give her attention by making an opportunity to do what he loved-- ponder over life's big questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:52:42.34" data-timestamp="3162.34"> My dad was kind of hardshelled, I guess. And so it took a lot. I had to keep asking these questions and keep wondering. For me, it was just, I had to keep going and keep trying, and keep being this little bird that goes on your shoulder and is like, I am now your friend.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:00.17" data-timestamp="3180.17"> Do you feel like it taught him how to talk to you better?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:03.92" data-timestamp="3183.92"> Yeah, definitely. Over the past three years, we've really worked on having actual conversations, than him just answering questions from me because we practice it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:18.53" data-timestamp="3198.53"> Rosie never knew that her dad spent months and months writing down each answer. Matt only told her when I started working on this story. And she said she felt like, what? Are you kidding me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:34.11" data-timestamp="3214.11"> I had no idea that he was doing all these things, and it was just a big surprise for me. If I could, I would definitely just say, forget the questions. I just wanna talk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:44.47" data-timestamp="3224.47"> So you're like, well, you don't even have to go through all that trouble.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:48.60" data-timestamp="3228.6"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:49.17" data-timestamp="3229.17"> Just hang out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:50.12" data-timestamp="3230.12"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:50.86" data-timestamp="3230.86"> Rosie said this to her dad when she found out, and it really threw him for a loop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Salyer</h4><p begin="00:53:55.68" data-timestamp="3235.68"> Yeah, it was a complete waste of time. I mean, what a complete waste of time to come up with these big, extensive projects that are definitely less important to them than just listening to them.</p><p begin="00:54:11.98" data-timestamp="3251.98">You know, what is time? Why? Explain. Well, I can tell you what I don't want time to be. I don't want time to be something where I am just figuring out that I need to shut up and make some time to listen to this little kid before it's too late.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:31.48" data-timestamp="3271.48"> Rosie really started asking the questions because she wanted to know that she wasn't alone and that everything was going to be OK. Now she enjoys hearing the answers because they remind her that that's true. That's why one of her favorite answers is the ending of, Time? Why? Explain. The part about all of the planets turning around themselves, and in the middle of it, Matt turning towards Rosie.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:54:56.42" data-timestamp="3296.42"> One of the main meanings of that is, even though everything is happening around you, he just wants to know about me a little more, I guess. And a thing that I really like about that is because he just uses these sentences that make me happy when I read them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:15.85" data-timestamp="3315.85"> You know, it's kinda funny, when he read this to me he sort of choked up a little bit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:55:22.60" data-timestamp="3322.6"> Yeah. He likes to be a one expression person. But when he reads stuff like this he gets all emotional. In the car ride here he was like, oh, I love you so much. And he was tearing up looking out the window, so--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:41.21" data-timestamp="3341.21"> You look so happy about that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:55:44.15" data-timestamp="3344.15"> Yeah.

And do you think that the real big reason why we ask it is to have a reason to talk to each other?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rosie Salyer</h4><p begin="00:56:12.57" data-timestamp="3372.57"> No, I think that philosophers actually really do wonder about these things. And they don't use it so that they could talk to their dads more. They use it because they really wonder about these things and they want to know everything. But for my personal use, yes. That's exactly it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:56:29.34" data-timestamp="3389.34"> Matt does still want to keep answering Rosie's questions for her. But as for the hardest question, what is love, I don't think Rosie needs her dad to explain that to her anymore. She gets it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:41.95" data-timestamp="3401.95"> Stephanie Foo is one of the producers of our program.</p></div> </div>
