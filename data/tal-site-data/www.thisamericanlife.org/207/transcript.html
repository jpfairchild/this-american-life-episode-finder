<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.30" data-timestamp="0.3"> Edward was just a little boy when he was switched from regular classes to special ed. It was kindergarten, and he viewed the move as a big step up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:00:06.82" data-timestamp="6.82">I thought it was cool because when you think of the word special meaning special, you know, like good, a good thing?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:15.56" data-timestamp="15.56"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:00:16.37" data-timestamp="16.37">And, with my name being Edward, I thought it was kind of built for me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:20.29" data-timestamp="20.29"> Oh. Like, Ed meant you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:00:22.29" data-timestamp="22.29"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:26.01" data-timestamp="26.01"> He was Ed. Of course he was going to special ed. And he didn't really figure out what special ed classes really meant for years, until one day in junior high school riding the school bus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:00:36.02" data-timestamp="36.02"> And one of my friends, who was younger than me, on the bus, asked me to help him with his homework. And I noticed he had harder homework than we did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:46.52" data-timestamp="46.52"> Why? What do you remember about his homework?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:00:48.50" data-timestamp="48.5"> Because he was doing like, I think it was, timetables and division-type things. And ours was addition and subtraction, still, and we were a couple of grades higher than he was. And the spelling words was like, they looked like high-schoolers would have a spelling word, kind of thing like, forbidden and probably some more words harder than that, kinda.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:17.52" data-timestamp="77.52"> Like the word forbidden. And what were you guys doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:01:20.35" data-timestamp="80.35"> Cow, sheep, sleep. It kind of got me mad. And I just kind of thought we were all regular. And then, that day, I saw kind of like a divider kind of thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.51" data-timestamp="101.51"> I would think that, that would be very hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Edward</h4><p begin="00:01:44.07" data-timestamp="104.07"> Well, yeah, because you kind of think of yourself as regular until these teachers and people of high authority are telling you you're not the same as everybody else. So you have to figure out OK, so why am I different?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:03.60" data-timestamp="123.6"> A lot of kids in junior high school and high school feel different. But to be told no, it's not your imagination, you are different? This moment is something a lot of kids in special ed get to at some point or another: a shocking moment of understanding that they are not the same as other kids and that everybody else knew that long ago. They knew it when they didn't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Holly</h4><p begin="00:02:23.68" data-timestamp="143.68"> We were doing a project in first grade. Putting a snowman-- actually, we had to put cut-out objects, like cut-out circles, and put it on there, and put stuff on it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:34.96" data-timestamp="154.96"> Holly is a high school student in Chicago. She's 18.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Holly</h4><p begin="00:02:38.38" data-timestamp="158.38"> And I was doing that. And I didn't cut one. And I accidentally unscrewed the top of the glue, and it spilled all over. So I had to clean it up. And then she put me in the corner and yelled at me. It was really embarrassing. Everybody was laughing. It was kind of hard. So that's the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] I really remember. I guess she thought I was stupid in some way. I felt bad about myself at that point because I realized that I really was different from everybody else.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:03:07.55" data-timestamp="187.55"> I was about, maybe, 14 when I was placed into a special ed class because my reading skills were real low.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:16.58" data-timestamp="196.58"> David is also a high school student here in Chicago. He's also 18.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:03:21.43" data-timestamp="201.43"> When I was placed into the special ed program, you know, I felt sad and lonely. For me, a man, like I was a slow person that had problems learning, like a mentally problems.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:39.20" data-timestamp="219.2"> Today on our program, stories of people who were told that they're different: some who were comfortable with that, some who did not understand it, some who understood it and did not like it. We bring you stories of the developmentally disabled. It is a very different kind of show for us with voices and stories that usually do not make it to the radio.</p><p begin="00:03:57.09" data-timestamp="237.09">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Our show today in three acts. Act One, Get On The Mic. In which we hear the story of what happens when you hand microphones to developmentally disabled people of various sorts and then send them out with camera crews to interview anyone they want on the streets of America. One thing that turns out to be on the minds of the disabled, same thing that's on your mind and mine, TV.</p><p begin="00:04:23.66" data-timestamp="263.66">Act Two, Black Hole Son. In that story we hear from a mother and her son who, at three, became mesmerized with black holes and Stephen Hawking, an obsession which gave way to bunnies and flowers.</p><p begin="00:04:36.22" data-timestamp="276.22">Act Three, Walkout. Veronica Chater tells the story of her own brother, Vincent, who one day quit his job at an assisted learning center, and then quit everything else, mystifying everybody in his life. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Get On The Mic</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:56.21" data-timestamp="296.21"> Act One, Get On The Mic. Here's a typical moment from the film, <i>How's</i> <i>Your</i> <i>News?</i> The film is a documentary in which five developmentally disabled people travel across America in an RV interviewing people they meet along the way. When they get to Texas, one of the reporters, Sue Harrington, is at a cattle auction talking to an auctioneer, an older guy wearing a cowboy hat. There's all sorts of talk about prices and cows. And then Sue, apropos of absolutely nothing, comes out with this question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Harrington</h4><p begin="00:05:25.68" data-timestamp="325.68"> Sir, have you lately read any good books or seen any good movies that you could recommend to us?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Auctioneer</h4><p begin="00:05:33.26" data-timestamp="333.26"> No, I ain't read any good books lately. I can't remember the name of the movie I saw the other day. I saw <i>Message</i> <i>in</i> <i>a</i> <i>Bottle</i>, and that was a dad gum good movie, I thought, kind of a tear-jerker.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Harrington</h4><p begin="00:05:46.42" data-timestamp="346.42"> Oh, really? Really? It's a good one? You know, that's the first good review I've heard for that one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Auctioneer</h4><p begin="00:05:53.63" data-timestamp="353.63"> Well, I'm kind of sentimental. I cried in <i>Old</i> <i>Yeller</i> too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:58.41" data-timestamp="358.41"> Now, <i>How's</i> <i>Your</i> <i>News?</i> team has an uncanny knack for bringing the sentimental out of people they meet. Arthur Bradford, who led the <i>How's</i> <i>Your</i> <i>News?</i> team across the country, he first got to know them in 1993 at a camp for disabled adults called Camp Jabberwocky. He was a counselor there teaching a video class. And as part of the class, he would take the campers out to do man-on-the-street interviews.</p><p begin="00:06:18.66" data-timestamp="378.66">They did that for a few summers, and then decided that it might be exciting and fun to try to do their interviews on a two-week, cross-country trip, which became this movie. Arthur says that, from the start, it's been interesting to see how people react to the disabled reporters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Arthur Bradford</h4><p begin="00:06:32.57" data-timestamp="392.57"> What I've noticed is that, when someone with a disability approaches someone on the street, this is without a camera or anything, that person sort of settles into OK, I need to, I guess basically, talk down to this person. It's sort of like they're talking to a child, I would say. But what I like about when you give them a microphone and a camera is that, suddenly, the people take them a little more seriously. And I would say they, maybe, give them a little more respect.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ron Simonsen</h4><p begin="00:07:06.89" data-timestamp="426.89"> Hello. My name is Ronnie. I'm from <i>How's</i> <i>Your</i> <i>News?</i>. What's your name, sir?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Curtis Tuldgrave</h4><p begin="00:07:11.95" data-timestamp="431.95"> Curtis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ron Simonsen</h4><p begin="00:07:13.02" data-timestamp="433.02"> Curtie, who?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Curtis Tuldgrave</h4><p begin="00:07:13.83" data-timestamp="433.83"> Tuldgrave.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ron Simonsen</h4><p begin="00:07:15.00" data-timestamp="435"> What do you do, Curtie?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Curtis Tuldgrave</h4><p begin="00:07:16.25" data-timestamp="436.25"> I work for the post office.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ron Simonsen</h4><p begin="00:07:17.22" data-timestamp="437.22"> Yeah? Tell us about the post office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Curtis Tuldgrave</h4><p begin="00:07:19.93" data-timestamp="439.93"> The post office is a good place to work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ron Simonsen</h4><p begin="00:07:21.51" data-timestamp="441.51"> Yeah? Yeah, I get my mail there at the post office. I love getting mail.

But, in this context, they don't, partially because it's clear how well the filmmakers know the reporters and love them. They were counselors and campers together in the RV. They've known each other for years, taking a road trip.</p><p begin="00:08:34.93" data-timestamp="514.93">Two of the reporters, Sean and Bobby, have Down's Syndrome. Larry has a condition called Spastic Cerebral Palsy. The two most talkative reporters, Ron, who has Cerebral Palsy, and Sue, who has a mental disability, came into a studio to talk about the film. They brought along a guitarist, Chad Urmston, one of their counselors, to play some of the songs from the film.</p><p begin="00:08:55.10" data-timestamp="535.1">I began by asking Ron what his thing for Chad Everett is all about.

<h3>Act Two: Black Hole Son</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:05.62" data-timestamp="1505.62"> Act Two: Black Hole Son. Because of a very rare genetic disease, Sam was born with holes in several vital organs, including his heart and his brain. For his first five years, if one wasn't making his life hell, the other was. He's seven now. And recently his mom and he sat down together to talk about how things used to be and how they got much, much better.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:25:26.01" data-timestamp="1526.01"> OK. So let me start interviewing you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:25:29.55" data-timestamp="1529.55">All right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:25:30.86" data-timestamp="1530.86"> Can you describe yourself? What kind of a person are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:25:36.05" data-timestamp="1536.05"> I'm nice and kindful person.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:25:39.30" data-timestamp="1539.3"> You're kindful?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:25:41.30" data-timestamp="1541.3"> Yes, and playful.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:25:44.48" data-timestamp="1544.48"> What do you do that's nice?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:25:46.39" data-timestamp="1546.39"> Hug you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:25:54.38" data-timestamp="1554.38"> When I was pregnant with Sam, the first ultrasound came back that there was something wrong. I was thinking just please, let it be something with his body not with his brain. I can handle his body, but I'll be a bad mom to a retarded child. Everybody has their thing they can't take, and that's it for me.</p><p begin="00:26:21.64" data-timestamp="1581.64">So when Sam was born, when he was five days old, he had heart failure. So then we learned about the deletion in the chromosome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome. So we didn't know if he was going to make it. And we had a talk with the geneticist. And he said if you give him the operations, it's not sure he'll pull through. But if he does, he's going to be retarded, probably. And I said OK. I don't care anymore. I want him, and I need him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:27:04.53" data-timestamp="1624.53"> What were you like when you were three years old?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:27:07.12" data-timestamp="1627.12"> I was walking, but I was crying too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:27:12.54" data-timestamp="1632.54"> Do you want to talk about what you used to be like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:27:17.66" data-timestamp="1637.66"> No way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:27:21.61" data-timestamp="1641.61"> He started torturing animals when he was three, and talking all the time about wanting to die. And he stabbed his stepfather with a plastic knife and drew blood, and poured boiling water on me, wiped things on the bus that should not be wiped.</p><p begin="00:27:47.05" data-timestamp="1667.05"></p><p begin="00:27:49.42" data-timestamp="1669.42">He was kicked out of school when he was four because they said he was a danger to himself and others. And so we took him to a psych unit, and he was studied for a few days. And that's when they told us about the bipolar, rapid-cycling bipolar, which is common in velo-cardio-facial syndrome. It has early-onset, and it hits you hard a lot of the time. And sometimes it doesn't, but it did in him. But nobody told me that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:28:27.68" data-timestamp="1707.68"> I want to show you a drawing that you did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:28:34.35" data-timestamp="1714.35"> That's me with heart faces and heart eyes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:28:43.69" data-timestamp="1723.69"> There's about 100 hearts in your face in this drawing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:28:48.18" data-timestamp="1728.18">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:28:49.06" data-timestamp="1729.06"> Green hearts, how come?

And we were watching Stephen Hawking, a show. At that time, he couldn't sit down for anything. He couldn't sit down for a 15-minute cartoon. But he was really into space. And this was the only time he sat down and he watched the boring show from start to finish. They had, I think it was like a '50s cartoon of a black hole on just for a second, you know, one of those swirly things. That just captivated him. He started drawing it all the time. In every family portrait, it'd be us and the black hole.</p><p begin="00:30:24.10" data-timestamp="1824.1">At school, they had this rainbow bear notebook and it would have all the kids' drawings in there. And there would be, like, 19 drawings of kids going sledding, kids going to McDonald's, kids playing with their siblings or something. And then, on Sam's page, it would be a black hole destroying the universe or a black hole coming down the railroad tracks sucking up humans. I was kind of proud of his differentness and his imagination, but, at the same time, I knew that it was like this horror to him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:31:16.50" data-timestamp="1876.5"> What are some nightmares you've had?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:31:18.60" data-timestamp="1878.6"> The moon, blowing moon.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:31:21.24" data-timestamp="1881.24"> The moon blows on you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:31:22.47" data-timestamp="1882.47"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:31:23.00" data-timestamp="1883">How come?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:31:23.86" data-timestamp="1883.86"> I think of bad thoughts that time.

Like, even when he was months old, if he saw a ceiling fan, it was the only time he would quiet. He would just stare at that ceiling fan. I know a lot of babies do, but he just was obsessed.</p><p begin="00:32:16.53" data-timestamp="1936.53">And then, when he was three, he had an imaginary friend, but it wasn't a boy, it was a fan. But this one was called bad, bad fan. And its blades were teeth. And then it had these little, tiny eyes and these little, tiny feet at the bottom, and it would kill people. It would just blow on people and that would kill them because his breath was filled with teeth. And then, sometimes when he broke things, he said bad, bad fan did it. And it was kind of creepy, you know? It was just me and him living in the house. And you start thinking-- oh.</p><p begin="00:33:15.38" data-timestamp="1995.38">He had to destroy all day long. He had to. He couldn't not. He destroyed his favorite toys. He destroyed my favorite furniture, anything that meant anything, especially.</p><p begin="00:33:28.67" data-timestamp="2008.67">And I used to watch <i>The</i> <i>Sally</i> <i>Jessy</i> <i>Raphael</i> <i>Shows,</i> or whoever it was that had all those shows about the out-of-control-- I think it was Montel-- had all the shows about the out-of-control, really young children. And the parents had to lock the door against them at night. And they lived in fear. And, supposedly, nobody could help.</p><p begin="00:33:51.19" data-timestamp="2031.19">And I would always think well, you must be really bad parents. I would never have a problem with controlling my kid. I would teach them how to act. And if I had your kid for a week, he'd shape up. And so, of course, once I became afraid of my child, I didn't tell anyone because I thought they would think the same thing about me. And I kind of thought the same thing about me. You know, he'd be nice and normal, and then just do something so horrible and senseless.</p><p begin="00:34:34.57" data-timestamp="2074.57">And it seemed like that to Sam too. He could never understand. He'd do something like try to break the cat's leg, something like that. And then, immediately afterwards, he'd be crying and saying, "I don't know why I did that." And he would be just as angry and sad as I was. And he'd say, "I don't understand." And he'd start punching himself and biting himself and putting bruises all over his body. Ugh! Oh, that was a horrible life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:35:12.68" data-timestamp="2112.68"> Do you know why you take the pills every day?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:35:17.86" data-timestamp="2117.86"> Because my brain is all, like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:35:22.59" data-timestamp="2122.59"> What is that?

And within 24 hours we noticed a change. And then, after about 56 hours, it was like night and day. This was not the same kid at all. It's hard to believe that we were all living like we were. I mean, I can't believe it. When I sit here and talk about it, I can't believe that that existed and I didn't try to get a diagnosis earlier. I just kept on thinking I could not be such a bad parent and it would get cured. Or, I don't know what I thought.</p><p begin="00:36:21.65" data-timestamp="2181.65">But, within two days after starting on the Zyprexa, we would go out. We could go to do three errands in one day. He could wait in line. He was doing well in school. I mean, it didn't happen overnight because he still at some bad memories, but he started to get some nice memories to put on top of the bad ones. And he just got nicer and nicer, and happier and sweeter. He stopped having nightmares. At first, he would ask me when his brain was going to be messed up again, but now he feels like it's his brain, you know? He feels like he's in control of his own brain.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sam's Mother</h4><p begin="00:37:19.92" data-timestamp="2239.92"> Do you have any girlfriends?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam</h4><p begin="00:37:22.14" data-timestamp="2242.14"> Yeah, only one.

It's because he's been through more pain and powerlessness than most people ever will in their whole life. And I think he took all that information about life, about what it is, what it means for him to be alive, and he made an informed decision that he's going to be happy with the good parts of life and he's going to spread them around. And I think he knows something about hearts and bunnies and rainbows. He's not like Forrest Gump, you know?

She says autistic kids, in general, tend to not understand social cues, and that her students, because of the severity of their autism, can't tell her their basic needs or thoughts.

And often, she's stumped.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sun Kim</h4><p begin="00:41:40.18" data-timestamp="2500.18"> Sometimes you'll just see them looking off in the distance and laughing.

Like, OK, I'm supposed to do this and I don't-- or are they hearing just, murmur, murmur, verbiage, and not really understanding? Or just listening to the tonalities of what we're saying?

It's at the center of what it means to deal with certain kinds of people with developmental disabilities.</p><p begin="00:42:23.20" data-timestamp="2543.2">Veronica Chater's younger brother, Vincent, can't do math, even the simplest addition. He doesn't speak well. He has a version of what used to be called mental retardation. But, when he was a baby and doctors tried to diagnose him, they couldn't find anyone else with his particular combination of symptoms, and so they named his own syndrome after him: the Vincent syndrome.</p><p begin="00:42:41.44" data-timestamp="2561.44">He's an adult now. And for a while seemed to be doing just fine, until a point a few years ago when he surprised everybody in the family by quitting his job, and then quitting everything else in his life. And it was not clear to them why he did it and what it meant and what it would mean for his future. Veronica Chater put together this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:42:59.36" data-timestamp="2579.36"> Ever since Vincent quit his job, he spent more and more time alone in his room. At Christmas, at our parent's house in northern California, my brothers and sisters and I weave in and out of the kitchen, talking about work, telling jokes, and taking orders from Mom.</p><p begin="00:43:15.51" data-timestamp="2595.51">There are 11 of us. I'm the second oldest. Vinnie's the fifth. As usual, he's nowhere to be seen. When I go down the hall, I find him in his bedroom with the door closed, drinking an orange soda from the can and watching an old movie.</p><p begin="00:43:29.77" data-timestamp="2609.77">[SOUND OF TELEVISION]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:43:36.52" data-timestamp="2616.52"> His face is close to the TV screen, about 10 inches away. And he has a serious expression, the kind you catch on a detective who's trying to crack a case. He could be 18 and he could be 50, you can't quite tell. He has a short little boy haircut. And, every day, he wears a sweatshirt with the words carpe diem on it. The truth is, he's 34.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:43:58.30" data-timestamp="2638.3"> Did Santa come and fill your stocking?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:44:01.64" data-timestamp="2641.64"> Indeed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:44:03.30" data-timestamp="2643.3"> What did you get in your stocking?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:44:07.52" data-timestamp="2647.52"> [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

They figured it was part of God's plan. He was an angel in our midst, as my dad always said. They refused to think of him as a burden, even though he would depend on them for the rest of their lives. Every morning, my mom readies him for the day: combing and gelling his hair, brushing his teeth, and shaving him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:45:05.94" data-timestamp="2705.94"> [SINGING] I like my clean-shaven man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:45:08.31" data-timestamp="2708.31"> She tilts his chin this way and that, handling him like a barber with an overbooked schedule.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:45:13.91" data-timestamp="2713.91"> Done.

You got that one. I didn't know if you were going to get that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:45:57.33" data-timestamp="2757.33">Despite his disability, Vinnie has a really good memory for all sorts of trivia. Quizzing him about movies is the impromptu game my mom and dad play with him throughout the day, from morning till night.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Dad</h4><p begin="00:46:07.34" data-timestamp="2767.34">OK, I've got one for you, Vincent. See if you can get this one. [SINGING] It was a Monday. Ain't gonna soldier no more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:46:17.31" data-timestamp="2777.31"> The bond between them is more than a bond, it's a union for life. As Vinnie passed through his teenage years and became an adult, Mom saw to it that he was kept busy. She signed him up for bowling, for Special Olympics, and for pretty much every seasonal sport from basketball to badminton.</p><p begin="00:46:35.38" data-timestamp="2795.38">But as he got older, Vinnie's personality grew darker and more mysterious. I didn't notice it right away. I don't think any of us did. Mom was so good at keeping Vinnie distracted from himself that it didn't seem like a problem. But two years ago, it grew too large to ignore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:46:51.76" data-timestamp="2811.76"> Let's play games.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:46:53.67" data-timestamp="2813.67"> I'm not playing games right now. Go get my sour cream. Come on. I want the sour cream. I can't make those chantilly potatoes without it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:47:02.21" data-timestamp="2822.21"> Every time I go home, it hits me a little bit more that, even though Vincent and I are about the same age, my mom talks to him like he's a precocious four-year-old. And, more and more, I've noticed that he's aware of it too. When he returned without the sour cream and noticed that Mom and I were talking about him, he got upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:47:19.24" data-timestamp="2839.24"> It is a wonderful reaction to talk about somebody? When you talk about me, I wonder.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:47:25.30" data-timestamp="2845.3">I talked right in front of you. I wasn't telling any secrets. I'm going to say what I'm going to say because it's true. There's nothing wrong with having the truth, is there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:47:35.68" data-timestamp="2855.68"> I'll put this away here--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:47:36.61" data-timestamp="2856.61"> You know, where it goes. Top shelf. The little slot, slide it in there. Thank you, very much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:47:41.41" data-timestamp="2861.41">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:47:43.86" data-timestamp="2863.86"> He can go from one minute to-- oh, yeah. Dad's so afraid he's going to get him angry, he won't give him any orders. I have to give all the orders. Yeah. If he wants to get smart with me, and I say, "God said you have to obey your parents I'm your mother. You do what I say, when I say. Da, da, da, da, da. Da, da, da, da." And he'll do something, sometimes I say, "You go in and you tell God you're sorry for that." He'll go in his room. And he comes out, "Sorry for talking like that." And I said, "That's fine, Vin. OK. We just don't do that." Then he gets in a really good mood after that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:48:20.66" data-timestamp="2900.66"> It might seem like my mom is rough on Vinnie, but I have to say that her way of dealing with him has pretty much worked out for the best, until the day Vinnie decided to retire. When he quit his job, Vinnie dropped everything including bowling, basketball, and the Special Olympics. Where once he was busy from dawn till dusk, now he had nothing to do, so he began sleeping to pass the time, up to 18 hours a day. It worried all of us, especially Mom. He was sleeping his life away, and we didn't understand why. It felt like we were losing him, like he was giving up, so I set out to figure out why.</p><p begin="00:49:03.23" data-timestamp="2943.23">If you ask Vinnie about why he quit his job, you don't get much of an answer. In general, it's hard to get a direct response out of him on any subject. "Could be," he'll say, or, "Maybe." It's not clear he even knows what his own feelings are sometimes. Often, when any of us asks him about his job, he'll just change the subject, like he did when I asked him about it, sitting in Mom's kitchen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:49:25.26" data-timestamp="2965.26"> How come you don't just tell me why you quit?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:49:29.23" data-timestamp="2969.23"> But seriously, it might be empty, blank there, after you were saying something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:49:43.21" data-timestamp="2983.21"> You mean you're leaving that section blank because you don't want to fill it in with words?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:49:47.92" data-timestamp="2987.92"> Blank is there before I finish words.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:49:51.36" data-timestamp="2991.36"> Are you playing word games with me now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:49:53.71" data-timestamp="2993.71"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:49:55.98" data-timestamp="2995.98"> We've all asked Vinnie dozens of times in dozens of different ways why he quit his job and everything else. And every time his answer is just as cryptic, and so we're all forced to guess what the real reasons are. My mom's best guess is that Vinnie put himself into early retirement and started all these dark moods because of a chemical change in his brain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:50:15.92" data-timestamp="3015.92"> The psychologist said he thinks there was a chemical imbalance that took place, suddenly, in his brain. And he prescribed Prozac for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:50:26.66" data-timestamp="3026.66"> Well, it's all chemical.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent's Mom</h4><p begin="00:50:28.74" data-timestamp="3028.74"> I don't know. It's really a mystery to me what happened there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:50:36.87" data-timestamp="3036.87"> Vinnie had worked for 12 years at a place called Concord Support Services, a company that hires mentally retarded adults and vocationally trains them. Vinnie always told me that he liked his job. He'd sit in a big warehouse with about 70 other disabled adults doing light assembly or stuffing envelopes. He made up to $60 a month, which, to him, was an infinite amount of money. We all assumed he'd found his place in the world.</p><p begin="00:51:02.61" data-timestamp="3062.61">Then, gradually, he started to become impatient and angry at work, threatening to break people's fingers if they touched him. He started disappearing into the work bathroom for up to an hour at a time just to get away from people. It was pretty clear that he was in a crisis.</p><p begin="00:51:19.79" data-timestamp="3079.79">On his last day, he was wandering around looking for a bead he'd dropped. His supervisor asked him what he was doing. One thing led to another. Vinnie lost his temper. My parents were called in for a meeting. And Vinnie quit, just up and walked out.</p><p begin="00:51:42.48" data-timestamp="3102.48">A few months ago, I asked Vinnie if he'd like to go back to his old job for a visit hoping it might spark something. I wasn't sure how he'd react, but he didn't even hesitate. He told me that he'd love to go. So the next morning, after my mom spiffed him up, we drove the route he'd taken for 12 years. When we arrived at the front doors, he's all smiles. He seems genuinely glad to be there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:52:05.32" data-timestamp="3125.32"> Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:52:06.14" data-timestamp="3126.14"> I remember you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:52:07.69" data-timestamp="3127.69"> You do? Nice to see you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:52:11.03" data-timestamp="3131.03"> But, as we approach the warehouse floor where Vinnie used to work, his pace slows. At the warehouse door, he hesitates and purses his lips together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:52:19.95" data-timestamp="3139.95"> Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:52:20.70" data-timestamp="3140.7">How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:52:21.91" data-timestamp="3141.91"> Wonderful. Hi. Nice to see you [? Jane. ?]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:52:26.74" data-timestamp="3146.74">Nice seeing you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:52:28.07" data-timestamp="3148.07"> He becomes shy and looks confused as one person after another comes up to him. Some touch him fondly, one man blows in his face, and everyone stares. Vinnie tries to appear cool, but I can tell he's tense.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:52:44.35" data-timestamp="3164.35"> We miss you, Vinnie. We miss the Vinnie Arnold we knew. We missed you, Vinnie. We missed you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:52:51.76" data-timestamp="3171.76"> Would you like to begin basketball practice Saturday?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:52:54.42" data-timestamp="3174.42"> I don't know. I'm not into-- I'm back into bowling and running again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:53:03.37" data-timestamp="3183.37"> We hang out. And Vinnie looks uncomfortable, except when he decides, on his own, to busy himself cleaning and straightening. After 15 minutes, he disappears into the bathroom, his old hiding place. After a while, he comes out for a few minutes, then goes back in, and then comes back out again. When he heads back into the bathroom for the third time, I know it's time to leave.</p><p begin="00:53:26.74" data-timestamp="3206.74">Later, I talked to my brother, Danny, about it. Of all my siblings, Danny spends the most time with Vinnie. They go to movies, take walks, go to bookstores. Danny thinks Vinnie might have quit his job for all the normal reasons any of us quit a job. Maybe it had nothing to do with his disability.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danny</h4><p begin="00:53:43.64" data-timestamp="3223.64"> I think he was probably extremely bored working in this place, doing the same thing over and over again: stuffing envelopes, putting paper clips in bags. There was no challenge to it, and I think it really frustrated him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:54:04.15" data-timestamp="3244.15"> Vinnie might have simply had enough, enough of other people controlling his life. All the adults in his life were doing the sensible things you do for disabled people: giving structure to his days, coaxing his moods, all with the best intentions. It's possible that, in the end, that wasn't enough of a life. And so, one day, he changed the one thing in his life that he could. He said no to the one thing he could say no to and quit his job, and then quit everything else.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danny</h4><p begin="00:54:32.99" data-timestamp="3272.99"> Being told what to do constantly, day in, and day out. And then he watches his other brothers and sisters running around and traveling and having their freedom, and here he is, stuck at home in his room. I can just imagine how frustrating that would be. It would make me angry if I was in that situation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:54:56.06" data-timestamp="3296.06"> After Vinnie retired, my mom and dad were determined to get him back into some kind of routine. After meeting with all sorts of social workers and suggesting dozens of ideas to Vinnie, they finally came up with something that he agreed to. They hired my brother, Bernard, to build a chicken coop in the backyard and to put Vinnie in charge of a miniature chicken farm. My mom had always wanted a chicken farm anyway. This was her big chance to get one.</p><p begin="00:55:21.70" data-timestamp="3321.7">Vinnie took to every aspect of chicken farming. He was painstakingly mindful of the chicken's daily schedule of free-range feeding and lock-up. And he was especially fastidious about coop hygiene. But more than that, to everyone's surprise, he started participating in activities again. He started basketball practice. And he's training again for the Special Olympics.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:55:43.78" data-timestamp="3343.78"> Molly, Polly, Jeanette, and Lonnie, here.</p><p begin="00:55:46.84" data-timestamp="3346.84">[CHICKEN CACKLE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Veronica Chater</h4><p begin="00:55:49.04" data-timestamp="3349.04"> Pretty much at any time of the day, you can see Vinnie standing as still as a marble sculpture in the backyard beside the coop, his eyes half closed, and his palms cupping the breeze, thinking, or just listening to the sound of his hens. He named them after old friends and talks to them like children.</p><p begin="00:56:07.53" data-timestamp="3367.53">[CHICKEN CACKLE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vincent</h4><p begin="00:56:08.02" data-timestamp="3368.02"> Molly, Polly, Jeanette and Lonnie.</p><p begin="00:56:10.52" data-timestamp="3370.52">[CHICKEN CACKLES]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:12.80" data-timestamp="3372.8"> Veronica Chater lives in Berkeley, California.
