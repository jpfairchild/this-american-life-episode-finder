<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.29" data-timestamp="0.29"> In Danielle's house, ever since she was a girl, when holiday dinners come, they serve a meal that will probably look familiar to you. Picture main course, big platter, drum sticks, white breast meat, golden brown skin, stuffing, and gravy, and cranberry relish on the side. And in Danielle's family they have a name for this meal that she told me on the phone recently. The name for this meal is--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:00:24.90" data-timestamp="24.9"> Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:26.25" data-timestamp="26.25"> Got that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:00:27.12" data-timestamp="27.12"> Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:30.62" data-timestamp="30.62"> Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> A special program today on the wonders of fish.</p><p begin="00:00:47.08" data-timestamp="47.08">Actually, we can say the word here, and the word is poultry. And as you know, each week on our program we choose some theme, invite a variety of writers and performers to tackle that theme. And this week, as we stand now in that magical five weeks of the year, that magical five weeks between the turkey served at Thanksgiving and the turkey served at Christmas, a period when Americans consume nearly a fourth of all the turkey consumed in this country every year. And every year during this important time, <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> brings you yet another program about poultry. That's right-- stories about turkeys, chickens, ducks, fowl of all kind, and their mysterious hold over us.</p><p begin="00:01:40.42" data-timestamp="100.42">I'm Ira Glass. Coming up this hour, Act One: Duki. The story of a typical American family and imaginary poultry. Act Two: what poultry-positive program would be complete without--</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chickenman Show Chorus Member</h4><p begin="00:01:57.76" data-timestamp="117.76"> Chickenman!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chickenman Show Chorus</h4><p begin="00:01:59.24" data-timestamp="119.24"> He's everywhere, he's everywhere!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:02.20" data-timestamp="122.2"> Yes, indeed. In the late 1960s, the winged warrior struck terror in the hearts of evildoers on radios all across this great nation. Today, my friends, he flies again. Act Three: Chicken Diva. In that act, an opera about Chicken Little sung in Italian, and-- no kidding-- able to make a grown man cry. Act Four: Trying To Respect The Chicken. The story of one woman's quest to try to give chickens the honor and the dignity that they are rarely accorded, even though the chickens resist her efforts.</p><p begin="00:02:41.00" data-timestamp="161">Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Duki</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:52.25" data-timestamp="172.25"> Act One: Duki. So in Danielle's family, the power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:03:01.95" data-timestamp="181.95"> Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:02.54" data-timestamp="182.54"> That's right. And they call it this for a reason. And the reason has to do with a stuffed hand puppet called Duki.</p><p begin="00:03:10.13" data-timestamp="190.13">Now, Danielle, is a woman over 30 years old. Her sister Ashley is two years younger. Duki has been in the family since they were children.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:03:17.60" data-timestamp="197.6"> Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about 8 and I was about 10. And when he first arrived, he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. He had a cape on and black kind of villain slash hero goggles. He lost the outfit pretty quickly and he went naked. And then he became Ashley's vehicle for torturing me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:58.05" data-timestamp="238.05"> It's not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle dominated Ashley. Ashley looked up to Danielle, fought to get her attention and her approval, and Danielle always, always got her way. Except when Duki was around.</p><p begin="00:04:19.95" data-timestamp="259.95">Basically, Ashley would channel-- I mean, the word's kind of an anachronism in this context-- but she would channel Duki. She would become Duki's voice. She would speak as Duki. And Duki was sarcastic. Duki was selfish and bossy. Duki would insult Danielle. Duki would tease Danielle. Duki would give her painful nose squeaks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:04:42.81" data-timestamp="282.81"> Whenever Ashley brought Duki into the equation, he was completely the dominant force. I was just putty in Duki's hands.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:52.86" data-timestamp="292.86"> Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley's personality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:04:59.06" data-timestamp="299.06"> Ashley is very kind of considerate, and-- she's very considerate and kind and thoughtful. And very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very concerned about if other people are happy and if someone or someone else doesn't feel good. And Duki has this total, like, you know, what's for lunch attitude. Like what's in it for me, in your face, totally out for himself. Simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:30.25" data-timestamp="330.25"> He's boastful and vain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:05:32.23" data-timestamp="332.23"> He's just this indomitable-- yeah-- indomitable spirit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:47.19" data-timestamp="347.19"> All right. I've been at Daniels apartment sometimes, and I've witnessed the following scene-- picture, please. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks. She picks up the phone, calls Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, "can you put Duki on?"</p><p begin="00:06:07.30" data-timestamp="367.3">And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the phone. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied. These are adult-- Danielle is an editor at a big New York magazine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:06:30.00" data-timestamp="390"> I adore Duki. I really love Duki. And sometimes I think if he disappeared, it would really feel like someone died. I mean, I look at him and he looks really kind of old and ratty, and it really makes me sad. I feel like-- it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki. And that it would be a big empty hole the world.</p><p begin="00:06:56.74" data-timestamp="416.74">He kind of takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, you know, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:18.07" data-timestamp="438.07"> So I hope it's becoming clear why, if you eat dinner in the home of Danielle's family, if they're serving some kind of poultry-- you know, chicken or turkey-- if you were to ask anybody in the family, "what's for dinner," they'll tell you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:30.59" data-timestamp="450.59"> Fish.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:31.08" data-timestamp="451.08"> Right. And the rationale for that is what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:34.93" data-timestamp="454.93"> It freaks Duki out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:36.13" data-timestamp="456.13"> It freaks him out, though-- you don't like him to know that perhaps some birds are, in fact, eaten?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:42.74" data-timestamp="462.74"> I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. He's in denial about most things. He's in denial about the fact that he's totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good looking and strong. And that he's really smart and has a lot of friends.</p><p begin="00:08:02.30" data-timestamp="482.3">He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him, and I say, "Duki, give me a break-- you're just stuffed." And he's like, "no way."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:24.11" data-timestamp="504.11"> Now, I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this program. So I contacted Danielle's sister Ashley and asked her, you know, "could Duki come on the air?" I received an answer back not by phone, but by electronic mail that for Duki to appear, I'd have to first go through someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mother.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:25.12" data-timestamp="1525.12"> We've arrived at Act Three of our program. Act Three: Chicken Diva.</p><p begin="00:25:30.14" data-timestamp="1530.14">Chickens are what we make of them in a lot of ways. If you could possibly need further evidence of that after those first two acts we just heard, we have this story from Jack Hitt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:25:41.81" data-timestamp="1541.81"> Oddly enough, it wasn't Susan who was obsessed with chickens, it was Kenny, a pal who worked backstage at the 92nd Street Y in New York. His house was filled with chicken cups, chicken masks. He got the whole staff onto chickens, including Susan. For a time there in the 80s, poultry-related jokes and references became the fast way to get a laugh at the Y.</p><p begin="00:26:03.06" data-timestamp="1563.06">I guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens, but Susan Vitucci saw something else-- their potential greatness, their hidden beauty, their grandeur. One day she glued together some finger puppets for a 10 minute rendition of the Chicken Little story for her nephew. That was 14 years ago. Today it is a full length opera enjoyed by a cult following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe or small theater.</p><p begin="00:26:30.64" data-timestamp="1590.64">It's still performed with finger puppets, but now it has a complete score written by a noted composer, Henry Krieger, who did <i>Dreamgirls.</i> The Chicken Little opera he wrote with Susan Vitucci is called <i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl.</i> Needless to say, that's F-O-W-L.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:26:46.94" data-timestamp="1606.94"> Well, we were going to start with the opening, Siamo del Teatro Repertorio delle Mollette.

And it's because when it's in English, we all kind of know it and it's really not that interesting. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. As soon as it's in Italian, it gives us enough distance that we can come in. You know, it makes us-- it's like the lover who doesn't want you. You don't want anybody more than you want the one who doesn't want you. Right? And so it's sort of the same thing.</p><p begin="00:28:21.39" data-timestamp="1701.39">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:28:46.33" data-timestamp="1726.33"> You may recall that when you last heard of Little, back in kindergarten, she was just an average barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on her head, which she mistakenly understood to be the sky falling. Her alarms excited her friends, Goosey Loosey, Turkey Lurkey, and Ducky Lucky. And they join her for a journey to the king to tell him the important news. On the way, they meet up with Sly Fox. Little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner, literally, as it turns out. Fortunately for Little, hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission, and she tracks on.</p><p begin="00:29:19.16" data-timestamp="1759.16">When she meets the king, he tells her that the sky's not falling-- it's just an acorn. So the enlightened Chicken Little returns to her coop, and that's where the story ends. What are we to take away from Little's experience? I like to think it's that Little is rewarded with life, precisely because she went off on this Quixotic mission, totally in the grip of a wrong idea.</p><p begin="00:29:42.46" data-timestamp="1782.46">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:29:56.95" data-timestamp="1796.95"> The children's fable barely figures into the story. It's just one small episode in the life of Chicken Little, now known as La Pulcina Piccola. After the acorn incident, she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure in almost every field imaginable, a diva of politics, academe, theater, art, daring-do. Like Venus, she arrives from some other world, transported on a scallop shell.</p><p begin="00:30:20.98" data-timestamp="1820.98">But the triumphs of her life began after a youthful love affair with a fighting cock ends bitterly, and she consoles herself, as we all do at some point in our lives, by plunging into Shakespeare. She becomes an overnight sensation as an actress, celebrated all over the world for one role. Juliet? Cleopatra? Ophelia?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:30:39.95" data-timestamp="1839.95"> The company then performs an excerpt of a recreation of her signature role, which is Richard III.

Not to mention that that puppet is a chicken, surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry and other avian supernumeraries. Susan says that, artistically, there's something special about chickens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:31:34.13" data-timestamp="1894.13"> They're a clean slate.

In the opera, she moves into the field of archaeology, masters it, needless to say, and makes a great discovery-- the last tomb of Gallapatra.

There are 60 pages so far, excerpts of which have appeared in <i>Clothes</i> <i>Lines,</i> the official fan club newsletter of the opera.</p><p begin="00:34:09.93" data-timestamp="2049.93"><i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl</i> has a strange effect on people. I didn't understand until Susan loaned me a videotape of one performance. To be honest, I thought I would be annoyed at the intentional irony and hokiness of the puppets. But there I was with my three year old daughter, who loved the show, watching a plastic bird pantomime one of the simplest human moments, but also one of the most profound-- the confession of a great love. In this case, with a cock robin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:34:36.36" data-timestamp="2076.36"> The song that she sings as she enters goes, "I am a chicken and ready for love.

And even in this goofy, un-bird-like situation, an hour of watching them makes clear just how hard it is to ever get birds to hit the standard. Which is to say not only do we completely dominate every aspect of the lives of chickens-- their births, their feed, their eggs, their slaughter-- not only have we bred them to human specifications to meet human needs, but we have created a standard for what it means to be a chicken that most chickens can never meet. That's what the standard means. We judge them as chickens, and we find them lacking.

But when you mate them together, you might get long-legged birds, or too short. I mean, you don't get what you want just by mating.
