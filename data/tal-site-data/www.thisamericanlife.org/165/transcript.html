<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.55" data-timestamp="0.55"> Hi there, everybody. Ira Glass here. Today's program is a rerun, but from a long time ago, the year 2000. So forgive any anachronisms you hear. That's a word a person doesn't get to say very often outside of the SATs.</p><p begin="00:00:13.80" data-timestamp="13.8">Forgive any anachronisms. It's back when the person at the center of the story still smoked, back before Notre Dame started burning. Anyway, it's a great show. We haven't aired it in forever. A total favorite. In honor of Bastille Day this month, here we go.</p><p begin="00:00:29.54" data-timestamp="29.54">It's a grey, rainy day in Paris.</p><p begin="00:00:31.01" data-timestamp="31.01">[CHATTER]</p><p begin="00:00:31.66" data-timestamp="31.66">A silky line of tourists waits on the grounds of an old medieval palace, now one of the most famous museums in the world. I'm with David Sedaris who lives nearby.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.73" data-timestamp="39.73"> So, David, explain where we are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:00:42.20" data-timestamp="42.2"> We're at the Louvre. And this is the closest I've ever come. I've never set foot inside the Louvre.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:50.54" data-timestamp="50.54"> So you've lived in Paris for how long?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:00:52.44" data-timestamp="52.44"> Two years. But I still haven't visited. I didn't see the point. Why come to Paris and go to the one place where you're not allowed to smoke? As a matter of fact, it's my goal to be the only person who's come to Paris and has never set foot in the Louvre.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:18.74" data-timestamp="78.74"> You live how far from here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:01:20.72" data-timestamp="80.72"> I'm probably about a 12-minute walk, 15-minute walk from the Louvre. I'm close to Notre Dame, too, but I've never gone in there either. It just doesn't interest me.</p><p begin="00:01:33.28" data-timestamp="93.28">I mean, I think so many people come here and they feel like they have to do certain things because somebody told them to do it, or they're going to go home and people will say, what do you mean you didn't see the Pantheon? What do you mean you didn't go into the Louvre?</p><p begin="00:01:44.05" data-timestamp="104.05">So I'm guessing that a good number of these people are just standing here because somebody told them that they should do it. I don't think that they're all museum-goers at home. I don't know. Do people look back and remember the experience of standing in front of a painting?</p><p begin="00:02:00.33" data-timestamp="120.33">I might remember eating something, or buying something, or seeing something, like an accident, or somebody who's really twisted up in some way, but not looking at a painting. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, for them, it doesn't get any better than this. But I don't know. Just from people that I know that have come here, they go to the Louvre because somebody told them that they have to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:33.90" data-timestamp="153.9"> Today on our radio program, where you might go in Paris instead of the Louvre. I spent three days with David Sedaris, who writes a lot about what it's like to live in France. He never saw the Eiffel Tower, or the Rodin Museum, or the famous cemetery where Marcel Proust and Jim Morrison are buried. No historical sites. Nothing having to do with the culture or language of the people of France. But if you want to know the best place to buy a model of a rotten tooth, or a collection of leeches, or a life-sized replica of a human head with the top cut off so you can see what's inside, David did show me that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:03:05.37" data-timestamp="185.37"> This is a pretty good medical supply store. These body parts that they have here, they're handmade and hand-painted. And they're not nearly as expensive as you would think that they would be.</p><p begin="00:03:15.48" data-timestamp="195.48">I think I got my sister Gretchen a stomach-- or a backbone. I got her a backbone made out of papier-mache for Christmas. And I think it probably cost about $60, which is a great price for a backbone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:36.97" data-timestamp="216.97"> Today in our program, Americans in Paris and how our Paris sometimes has very little to do with the one familiar to the locals. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:03:48.19" data-timestamp="228.19">The French government says that three and a half million Americans visited Paris last year. The US government says it was more like two and a half million. Either way, it is a lot more than the actual population of Paris, which is 2.1 million.</p><p begin="00:04:01.90" data-timestamp="241.9">Americans have dreamy and romantic ideas about Paris, more than other places, I think. In 1944, at the liberation of Paris from the Nazis, EB White wrote, "Probably one of the dullest stretches of prose in any man's library is the article in Paris in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Yet when we heard the news of liberation, being unable to think of anything else to do, we sat down and read it straight through, from beginning to end.</p><p begin="00:04:25.06" data-timestamp="265.06">Paris, we began, capital of France and of the Department of San, situated on the Ile de la Cite, the Ile St. Louis, and the Ile Louvier in the Seine, as well as on both banks of the Seine. The words seemed like the beginning of a great poem. A feeling of simple awe overtook us as we slowly turned the page and settled down to a study of the city's weather graph and the view of the Seine looking east from Notre Dame. The rainfall is rather evenly distributed, continued the encyclopedist. Evenly distributed, we thought to ourselves, like the tears of those who love Paris."</p><p begin="00:04:58.77" data-timestamp="298.77">But what is it actually like in Paris, really, without the rose-colored glasses, if you're American? Well, our <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> team headed overseas to find out. And let's just pause for a moment. What exactly does that sound like, you wonder? Well, here's a recording.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:05:16.42" data-timestamp="316.42"> Would you like to take a guided tour of Paris?</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:05:18.74" data-timestamp="318.74"> No, no, no, we're not tourists.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:05:19.89" data-timestamp="319.89"> Do we look like those people who run around gaping all day?</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:05:22.89" data-timestamp="322.89"> I guess they can't understand anyone coming to Paris to work!</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:05:25.48" data-timestamp="325.48"> My suggestion is that we all go straight to our hotels and get some rest. I, for one, am exhausted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:33.50" data-timestamp="333.5"> Well, in act one of our program today, "Him Talk Pretty Three Days," David Sedaris gives me and you a walking tour of his favorite places in the city that he calls home. Act two, "Ca Vie Americaine," in which we try to answer the question, what is it that some Americans see in Paris anyway? What is the draw?</p><p begin="00:05:54.31" data-timestamp="354.31">Act three, "Notes of a Native Daughter--" why it helps sometimes to pretend your French accent is worse than it really is, and why it's harder to cut into a movie line in Paris than in New York, and whether it is the same for African-Americans these days in Paris as it was in the heyday of James Baldwin and Sidney Bechet. Answers. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Him Talk Pretty Three Days</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:28.31" data-timestamp="388.31"> Act one, "Him Talk Pretty Three Days." Two years ago, at the age of 41, barely speaking French, David Sedaris moved to Paris. He had no special feelings about France, no particular interest in the French. It would be the same if it's Korea, he said to me, a sentence that, I think, if the French ever heard that he said it, they would deport him.</p><p begin="00:06:49.06" data-timestamp="409.06">He moved for two reasons-- one, his boyfriend Hugh had a rundown house in Normandy, and, two, why not? And over the course of two years, he has written extensively about his experience in stories for the radio, for magazines, and for his newest book. In his stories, David portrays life in Paris as a series of humiliations and near-humiliations. And if you hang out with him for a few days, you realize he is not exaggerating much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:07:16.56" data-timestamp="436.56"> This is my worst nightmare right here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:18.80" data-timestamp="438.8"> We'd barely gone three blocks from his apartment on our walking tour Paris when he stopped on the sidewalk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:07:24.54" data-timestamp="444.54"> OK, my lighter has run out of fluid, which would mean that I would have to ask somebody for a match. And so what I would say is, hello, do you have some fire? And I so hate saying that that I usually carry four lighters on me so I always have a backup.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:44.12" data-timestamp="464.12"> So you're just digging into your bag here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:07:48.06" data-timestamp="468.06"> Extra cigarettes. I know I must have a lighter in here. I will not spend the afternoon asking people if they have fire.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:02.70" data-timestamp="482.7"> I was curious about David's thoughts about Paris, precisely because he was never somebody who had any special feelings for the place. He didn't move here with his head full of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Sartre, and Proust. He was a blank slate.</p><p begin="00:08:16.43" data-timestamp="496.43">And so for several hours every day I was in Paris, David would walk me to the places he finds most interesting. And the first thing I learned was this. It is so traumatic to learn a new language that a lot of David's experience of the city, a lot of his personal geography of Paris, has to do simply with where people are cruel to him when he speaks and where they aren't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:08:37.84" data-timestamp="517.84"> This is a hardware store where the owner and the people who work there are really, really nice to me. I buy things here all the time. And I buy things that I don't even need just because they're so kind.

After years of making his living cleaning apartments and carrying furniture, he finally had published books, made the bestseller list, was on the radio, went on tours, and filled 2,000 and 5,000-seat halls with people who wanted to hear him read. And I think most people are built to take only so much of that, to have people think that we're somebody.</p><p begin="00:15:49.28" data-timestamp="949.28">I think, for most people, for people who are not hopeless egomaniacs, there is a normal balancing that has to happen, of believing that they're a somebody to believing that they're a nobody. There's a ratio, a balance that has to happen in most people's heads. I've known David for 10 years.</p><p begin="00:16:05.90" data-timestamp="965.9">And I think that what happened to him is that the somebody side of that equation got crazily inflated, fantastically inflated. And so the nobody side had to hyper-inflate to catch up. They had to balance out.

If somebody does something stupid in front of him, David says, he goes home, writes it down, tells his friends, sometimes turns it into a story that he reads in front of thousands or tens of thousands of strangers. And so when he says something stupid in French, which he does daily, he believes that it is possible the shopkeepers or waiters just shrug it off and never think about it again. But it seems just as possible that they go, tell their friends, and laugh at him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:19:21.84" data-timestamp="1161.84"> That's why I get so embarrassed of the way that I speak.

And she would come to our house to visit when we were young.</p><p begin="00:28:07.97" data-timestamp="1687.97">But I only went to her house once. And it was right before she died. And she had a trophy room. And there were all kinds of animals in there, extinct animals. There were snow leopards in there. There were white tigers in there.</p><p begin="00:28:19.48" data-timestamp="1699.48">And you would walk into this perfect room, and there were thousands of eyes staring at you. And I just thought, this is what I want. And that's the thing that I loved. And that's the feeling you get when you go into Deyolle, that all of these creatures that are stuffed and poised to pounce are all staring at you. It's the same feeling you get from being in front of an audience.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:48.13" data-timestamp="1728.13"> It's the same feeling you get in front of an audience?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:28:50.54" data-timestamp="1730.54"> Yeah, that people are looking at you. But these are creatures that are looking at you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:56.98" data-timestamp="1736.98"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:28:58.76" data-timestamp="1738.76"> You know that feeling, that feeling when somebody is watching you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:04.56" data-timestamp="1744.56"> David, of course, thinks about that feeling a lot, especially here in France, where he wonders what Parisians think as they watch him speaking so badly. But it's not entirely so hard, that daily stage fright, worrying about how to say every little thing, anxious and straining to understand all the words around him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:29:23.91" data-timestamp="1763.91"> It's that thinking that makes me feel alive and that makes me notice everything around me. When I become complacent, like I was in the United States, you just get used to things, so you don't think about them. You think, I'll get a cab. I'll go to the airport. I'll have a patty melt. And you don't think about it.</p><p begin="00:29:42.57" data-timestamp="1782.57">Whereas now, with me, the anxiety starts early on. And I'm always afraid that someone's going to throw me a curveball and ask me a question, like, what sign are you? They'll just ask me a question like that out of nowhere, and I'll appear foolish. So it keeps me on edge. But really, that edginess has always made me feel alive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:07.21" data-timestamp="1807.21"> Someday, David says, he'll be more comfortable in French. His accent will improve and that daily anxiety will be removed from his life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:30:14.40" data-timestamp="1814.4"> But when it is removed from me, then I probably won't be interested in living here anymore. I'll probably leave.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:21.19" data-timestamp="1821.19"> Because it'll be just like living back home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:30:23.65" data-timestamp="1823.65"> Plus the more you learn, the more disappointed you wind up being. It's easy to like somebody when you don't know what they're saying.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:32.39" data-timestamp="1832.39"> That's interesting. I hadn't thought about that, that not understanding somebody makes them seem more interesting than they really are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:30:39.55" data-timestamp="1839.55"> I just assume that everyone talked about books and movies all the time. That's all they talked about, as far as I was concerned. And then I learned a little bit more and I realized that they're no different than the people anywhere else, that they talk about the same banal things that we all talk about everywhere.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:03.06" data-timestamp="1863.06"> At one point, at the cafe David goes to all the time, we sit and watch a waiter that David likes to watch, though he barely dares to say a word to him. The waiter's in his mid-40's with a kind, baggy face. Picture the actor who played the scarecrow in <i>The</i> <i>Wizard</i> <i>of</i> <i>Oz,</i> Ray Bolger.</p><p begin="00:31:17.53" data-timestamp="1877.53">And this waiter's kind of a cut-up. He hangs out with the regulars, making them laugh at this and that. That's what makes him fun to watch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:31:24.27" data-timestamp="1884.27"> You wonder, though, where that guy lives, or how much money he makes, or if he's married.

Do you think he makes his bed?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:44.07" data-timestamp="1904.07"> For now, things are good for David in Paris. He still feels curious about everything, about figuring out what it all means. And that makes everything so interesting all the time. The mystery has not ebbed from everyday life. Ray Bolger takes a sip of wine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:31:59.54" data-timestamp="1919.54"> I always like it, too, when people drink on the job.

If I can lay my cards on the table at this point in the program, I have never understood why anybody cares so much about France. I mean, it's fine. It's lovely.</p><p begin="00:33:30.48" data-timestamp="2010.48">But there is just this thing that some Americans have for Paris. Though, as they are the first to admit, it can be kind of ridiculous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kristin Hohenadel</h4><p begin="00:33:38.52" data-timestamp="2018.52"> Well, when people ask me where I live, I sometimes say Paris. And they say, well, you live in Paris? But that's my dream.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:46.65" data-timestamp="2026.65"> Kristin Hohenadel has lived in Paris for five years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kristin Hohenadel</h4><p begin="00:33:49.71" data-timestamp="2029.71"> Why do you live in Paris? And I say, well, I just sort of wanted to. All the reasons that you would give sound really embarrassing, cliche, and ridiculous at this point. Paris is a stale dream.</p><p begin="00:34:02.69" data-timestamp="2042.69">And it's kind of like falling in love with the most obviously cute boy in the class, or a movie star. It's like being a groupie. And then you try to convince the other 25 women who he slept with last week, well, I really love him, and I think he loves me too.</p><p begin="00:34:28.62" data-timestamp="2068.62">There are some people who come here and they sort of get off on that feeling of being-- they think they're unusual because they put themselves in this position. And to me, that's really kind of awful and embarrassing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:41.08" data-timestamp="2081.08"> They think they're really special.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kristin Hohenadel</h4><p begin="00:34:42.61" data-timestamp="2082.61"> Yeah. They think it makes them special to live here, A, as if it's original. And B, part of the horrifying thing about moving here is it's a sort of disappointing experience to realize that your dream is so banal.</p><p begin="00:35:01.55" data-timestamp="2101.55">This is a dream I had my whole life. And it seems ridiculous to me now that it meant so much to me. It was so important.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:14.57" data-timestamp="2114.57"> The thing about loving a city, Kristin says, is that a city doesn't really love you back. Whenever I asked Americans who love France what it was about France that just got to them so much-- when did it begin for them, their feeling about France-- they all talked about scraps of French culture that made it to them when they were very young-- the <i>Madeline</i> books, <i>The</i> <i>Red</i> <i>Balloon,</i> French films, Montessori French class in grade school. I think there is still a part of America where the idea of Paris-- Paris, not the space program, or the internet, or moving to New York City-- Paris represents reaching a world outside oneself.</p><p begin="00:35:49.04" data-timestamp="2149.04">Richard Klein first started coming here as a teenager from a small town in Pennsylvania and has essentially constructed an entire life around the feeling that he got in Paris. He went on to become a scholar and director of the Romance Studies department at Cornell University and author of several books, <i>Eat</i> <i>Fat</i> and <i>Cigarettes</i> <i>Are</i> <i>Sublime,</i> which are deeply suffused with a sensibility that is partly just un-American or, anyway, semi-Parisian, a sensibility that is all about the small pleasures of everyday life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Klein</h4><p begin="00:36:17.81" data-timestamp="2177.81"> You know, the French have a much more uncomplicated and much less guilty relationship to their body, beginning with eating, not only the way they eat, the pleasure that they take in eating. The American notion that food is medicine, for example, is totally repulsive to the French. And yet increasingly, in America, that's all you hear. People eat only as a function of what they think is good for them. And nobody in France would eat strictly as a function of what's good for them.</p><p begin="00:36:52.22" data-timestamp="2212.22">I'll tell you, I think really the heart of it, for me, when I came here in 1958 for the first time, was Les Halles. Les Halles was the central marketplace right in the heart of Paris, not far from where we are. And I remember I used to go there not every night but frequently.</p><p begin="00:37:12.71" data-timestamp="2232.71">And then, at around 2:00 in the morning, you would go out in the streets in Les Halles, which was the central marketplace. And they used to bring all the food every night. Trucks would bring the produce and food from all over France to the center of Paris, to the heart of Paris, and display it in the stalls all around the streets.</p><p begin="00:37:32.93" data-timestamp="2252.93">Butchers were there with their blood-splattered coats. And people made gorgeous piles of artichokes and carrots and cabbages. And it was 2:00 in the morning and it was like life was just beginning at that hour.</p><p begin="00:37:49.86" data-timestamp="2269.86">And people were there sort of buying and selling. And then right next to Les Halles was La Rue Saint-Denis. And La Rue Saint-Denis was the center of prostitution in Paris.</p><p begin="00:38:04.34" data-timestamp="2284.34">And the people who worked there would work until 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, and then they would visit the prostitutes who were there all night. But this world of-- I don't know-- this incredible life, and food, and sex, and beauty in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts and oldest parts of the past-- it used to be until the 19th century that the biggest cemetery was right there in Paris.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:40.42" data-timestamp="2320.42"> If you walk around Paris with Richard, he's constantly pointing out spots that had special meaning to Louis XIV. Or there's a restaurant that happened to be one of the first restaurants ever built in France, just after they began the idea of restaurants, or the shops where the notion of putting big, huge windows on the front of stores probably began so people could window shop. The fact is, a lot of what is so pleasing about being in Paris is simple. It's a really interesting, pleasing place just to walk around.</p><p begin="00:39:06.03" data-timestamp="2346.03">When Kristin Hohenadel tried last year to live back in the States again, she found she missed living in Paris. She missed all that. It'd be kind of hard to get ordinary things done in France. You're always kind of an outsider here, even after years in the country. But she just feels better here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kristin Hohenadel</h4><p begin="00:39:19.06" data-timestamp="2359.06"> You know, you walk down the street in Los Angeles-- and it's a terrible example, because it's Los Angeles-- but you feel kind of dwarfed. And here, I just think, yes, this is exactly it. This is how life should be-- the pace, the scale, the way it looks.</p><p begin="00:39:46.80" data-timestamp="2386.8">[MUSIC - BLOSSOM DEARIE, "COMMENT ALLEZ-VOUS?"]</p><p begin="00:39:50.21" data-timestamp="2390.21"></p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Three: Notes From A Native Daughter</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:03.29" data-timestamp="2403.29"> Act three, "Notes of a Native Daughter." Janet McDonald had already learned the language. She'd already learned the culture, had French friends and a French apartment, when something happened that made her realize how much she hadn't figured out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:40:15.58" data-timestamp="2415.58"> I was going to the movies with a friend of mine from Yale who is black also. And there was a long line. And we were like, let's jump the line.</p><p begin="00:40:26.95" data-timestamp="2426.95">These white people, they're going to be scared of us. We'll just go and jump the line. We'll get to the front of the line.</p><p begin="00:40:31.23" data-timestamp="2431.23">So of course, we walked up to the front of the line, like, yeah, you want to try me? I'm black. That usually works in New York.</p><p begin="00:40:39.70" data-timestamp="2439.7">These people were ready to rip our hair out. And they were white. I couldn't believe it.</p><p begin="00:40:45.41" data-timestamp="2445.41">And they were like, in French, what are you doing? The line starts back there! You can't just walk to the front of the line!</p><p begin="00:40:50.29" data-timestamp="2450.29">They were ready to kick our butts. I was shocked. I'm like, these are white people and they're not scared of us? [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:41:00.14" data-timestamp="2460.14">That's when I realized I wasn't in Kansas anymore. And I liked it. Of course, it was kind of humiliating, because we're supposed to be the intimidating, scary ones. And then all these like French bitches in high heels are threatening us, and they were in our faces. [LAUGHS] And it made me realize that whole black-white game just doesn't work outside of the United States.</p><p begin="00:41:34.81" data-timestamp="2494.81">Because white people aren't afraid of you here. And at the same time, they don't hate you. Because that sort of goes together.</p><p begin="00:41:42.75" data-timestamp="2502.75">So I'll take it. I'll wait on line. Now I don't dare jump lines. [LAUGHS] So that opened my eyes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:58.75" data-timestamp="2518.75"> Janet and I are sitting in the Cafe Flore, one of those famous and corniest and most pretentious settings in which to meet, because it and the Deux Magots cafe next door were home to Sartre, and Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir, and, when he first arrived in Paris in 1946, Richard Wright, who was well known by them as the author of <i>Black</i> <i>Boy</i> and <i>Native</i> <i>Son.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:42:17.24" data-timestamp="2537.24"> Now it's sort of a gathering place for tourists, and wannabes, and nostalgic fake French people such as myself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:28.52" data-timestamp="2548.52"> It's classic old cafe on a corner with aging fixtures and plate glass windows onto the street. Lovely, but not ornate. By the time Richard Wright arrived here, Josephine Baker had come, seen, and conquered. Black GIs had come and conquered. Jazz had simply conquered.</p><p begin="00:42:42.95" data-timestamp="2562.95">Wright wrote in a letter, "There's such an absence of race hatred. It seems a little unreal." I wanted to talk to Janet, because I wanted to find out if it was still that way for blacks in Paris. It didn't seem possible, really.</p><p begin="00:42:54.40" data-timestamp="2574.4">In the half-century since those days, there's been an influx of black Africans to France. And they are not beloved. National Front party, with the slogan "France is for the French," wins 15% of the vote in national elections. Could it be possible that African-Americans still get a warm reception here? Janet said yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:43:13.10" data-timestamp="2593.1"> I'm not sure what it is. All I know is that it feels very different to be around French white people than American white people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:20.92" data-timestamp="2600.92"> Different how?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:43:22.25" data-timestamp="2602.25"> I feel much more comfortable. I feel that I'm not a black object.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:28.72" data-timestamp="2608.72"> Richard Wright, after arriving here in the mid-1940s, said that he felt that, all of his life, he'd been carrying a corpse with him. And when he came to Paris, he felt it slip off his back. Did you have that kind of feeling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:43:41.18" data-timestamp="2621.18"> Yeah. I really have to say that I have felt that way ever since I got here. And a lot of my friends say, why are you living there? In fact, a friend of mine I went to law school with, he said, what is it about speaking French that makes white people not racist? He was very skeptical.</p><p begin="00:44:00.92" data-timestamp="2640.92">But really, it goes beyond that. And it's not just that we feel free of the burden of race. Because we're still black.</p><p begin="00:44:10.81" data-timestamp="2650.81">I still experience myself as black. It's just that that's not the center of my identity. It's not the first thing people relate to when I meet them here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:25.58" data-timestamp="2665.58"> Janet first came to Paris in 1975 and moved here in '95. She's a lawyer in the French office of a big American company. She grew up in the public housing projects in Brooklyn, worked her way into Vassar College and onto graduate school and law school. And like a lot of people who make the jump from very poor, crime-ridden neighborhoods into the college-educated upper middle class, she felt like she didn't really fit in anywhere, not with family and friends in the projects who were shooting heroin, barely surviving, not with the black students she met in college.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:44:53.45" data-timestamp="2693.45"> I thought they were Bourgeois southern belles. I didn't want to be anything like them. And they didn't want to be like me either. They thought I was trash.</p><p begin="00:45:00.77" data-timestamp="2700.77">I was project trash. I thought they put the B in bougie. And so I grappled a lot with the racial identity.</p><p begin="00:45:10.52" data-timestamp="2710.52">What will my posture be? I'm from the projects, but people say I talk like a white girl. And then the white girls are like, oh, you're so project.</p><p begin="00:45:19.37" data-timestamp="2719.37">And then when I got here, none of it mattered. Because if I spoke three words of French that made sense, people liked me and they celebrated me. So I didn't have to worry about talking like a white girl, or a project girl, or anything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:33.74" data-timestamp="2733.74"> It was an incredible relief. The central conflict of her life suddenly vanished. In Paris, all the distinctions about what kind of black person she should be, they were all moot. In fact, the most distinguishing fact about Janet was not that she was black. It was that she was an American, which surprised her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:45:49.79" data-timestamp="2749.79"> I associated the word American with white guys with flags on their lawns who didn't particularly like me. And people would call me American. And I'd say, I'm not American. I'm black.</p><p begin="00:46:02.39" data-timestamp="2762.39">And these were black French people. And they were like, you are so American. And I remember these French West Indian friends of mine-- this one in particular from Martinique-- saying, you even walk like an American.</p><p begin="00:46:15.71" data-timestamp="2775.71">I'm like, what do you mean? What does an American walk like? And she said, they kick their legs when they walk. They kick their legs forward.</p><p begin="00:46:26.79" data-timestamp="2786.79">I don't know. Because I was in Brooklyn just a few weeks ago. And this woman who'd never been to Europe was saying, so what's it like in France? What are the people like? Are they prejudiced?</p><p begin="00:46:39.54" data-timestamp="2799.54">I said, no, they like us. It's incredible-- a country full of white people and they like us. But it's a difficult thing, because they like us, but they don't like other people who look like us. And that's sort of the French paradox.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:56.37" data-timestamp="2816.37"> Paris, of course, has its own housing projects in the suburbs that surround the city. Now, with generations of Africans who were born on French soil, they face job discrimination, housing discrimination.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:47:06.30" data-timestamp="2826.3"> And they're not well received. They're not welcomed. And they are French.</p><p begin="00:47:11.49" data-timestamp="2831.49">And so in a way, for African-Americans, we're in a very bizarre position. It's almost like being an honorary white in apartheid South Africa. And I noticed that, as my French got better and better, sometimes I wasn't as well received as I would be if I played up my American accent. If I walked into a shop, and people would think I was just basically-- what I say-- just another [BLEEP], just like one of their own, like from Martinique or Guadalupe, it wouldn't be the same reception if I came on with a very heavy American accent or even spoke English.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:55.47" data-timestamp="2875.47"> Why? How would they treat you if they thought you were an African black?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:47:58.49" data-timestamp="2878.49"> A little bit of a chill in the air, like, yes, may I help you? Not so much, oh, vous etes Americaine! Oh, I love New York! I love to speak English!</p><p begin="00:48:09.12" data-timestamp="2889.12">So it's very bizarre. It's a hard thing to reconcile. Because good feeling is good feeling. And when someone receives you and makes you feel good, it's a positive experience.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:29.65" data-timestamp="2909.65"> When you're in a shop, and you can feel that there's a chill in the air, and that they think of you as an African, will you actually play up your American accent?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:48:38.37" data-timestamp="2918.37"> Well, what happened was I started experiencing that. And so I actually adjusted my speech so that at least I would get the benefit of-- I mean, I'm here in this country. I want to get the benefit of being an African-American.</p><p begin="00:48:57.66" data-timestamp="2937.66">So instead of walking in-- oui, madame, [SPEAKING FRENCH], I'd say, oui, [SPEAKING FRENCH]. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:49:08.41" data-timestamp="2948.41"></p><p begin="00:49:09.69" data-timestamp="2949.69">Maybe I shouldn't do that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:12.09" data-timestamp="2952.09"> And it works?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:49:12.98" data-timestamp="2952.98"> Yeah, and it works.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:23.56" data-timestamp="2963.56"> A friend of Janet's suggested to her that maybe Parisians prefer black people from America because only a certain class of black Americans usually comes to France-- educated, cultured, interested in France. When Janet asked the writer Cornel West about this at a speech he gave this summer in Paris, that was his argument.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:49:39.76" data-timestamp="2979.76"> Basically, he suggested it was a class thing. And he said, well, look at you. You're professional. You're articulate. Maybe if you brought 15 of your cousins, it would be a whole different thing.</p><p begin="00:49:51.56" data-timestamp="2991.56">So basically he was saying, if I brought all my homegirls from the hood who didn't go to Vassar, and who weren't lawyers, and who didn't speak French, the reception might be a little chillier, even though they also are black American. But I think, if that's true, that is not about racism. Then that's about class.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:17.51" data-timestamp="3017.51"> Before I met Janet, I read the book that she wrote about what it was like for her growing up. It's called <i>Project</i> <i>Girl.</i> And what's remarkable about it is how frank she is about all of the compulsive things that she found herself doing during the years that she was regularly traveling between the projects and the world of the aspiring upper middle class. It was a struggle.</p><p begin="00:50:35.31" data-timestamp="3035.31">In her first year at Vassar, for instance, she felt so out of place that she started taking the train down to New York City to score heroin, a thing she'd never even done when she lived in the projects, until she got kicked out of school for that. It was as if the further that she traveled into the world of college, the more the project side of her personality was compelled to express itself somehow. She depicts herself as somebody who was depressed and embattled and sort of lost for years.</p><p begin="00:50:59.46" data-timestamp="3059.46">And the most striking thing about meeting her, if you've read the book, is how completely happy she seems today. She's one of the happiest-seeming people I've ever met, just relaxed, and funny, and at ease. And her feeling about France, the country with this transformation took place, it can be sort of shocking to actual French people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:51:17.89" data-timestamp="3077.89"> When we just won the Euro 2000, I came to work and I was telling the Moroccan secretary, we won! [SPEAKING FRENCH] And she just glares at me.</p><p begin="00:51:28.69" data-timestamp="3088.69">Because she was born here. And she says, I'm not French. I'm Moroccan. It's just like black Americans. I'm not American, I'm black.</p><p begin="00:51:35.47" data-timestamp="3095.47">And I was like, we won, we won! And she was like, what are you talking about? You're not even French. What do you mean, we won? I'm like, I'm French in my heart. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:51:45.72" data-timestamp="3105.72">And this black friend of mine was saying, you're the only person I know who could sing "The Marseillaise." That shows how extreme you are. Do you know why?</p><p begin="00:51:55.37" data-timestamp="3115.37">It's because I say to them, I never had a country. I never had a country. I had a hood. I had Brooklyn.</p><p begin="00:52:03.01" data-timestamp="3123.01">But I never felt like I had a country. So now I have a country. It's a little one. We always come in third or fourth place in the Olympics. But it's France.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:21.40" data-timestamp="3141.4"> Here's something else. There are certain things about French culture, Janet says, that just make life here very pleasant. For one thing, people don't ask you personal questions-- where you grew up, where you work, what's your family like, what's your story? You're not constantly explaining yourself. She says she has one friend who she knew for five years before she knew this woman had a grown son.</p><p begin="00:52:42.28" data-timestamp="3162.28">Also, there isn't the same striving, the same ambition to be number one as in the States, especially compared with the corporate law job she used to have where everybody was expected to put in 60 and 70 and 80 hours a week. Here, that would be seen as very strange. Work just is not that important to most people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:52:59.41" data-timestamp="3179.41"> I'll get tears in my eyes. Sometimes I look around the subway, and I look at all these French people, and I'm like, thank you for letting me live here in your country.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:13.55" data-timestamp="3193.55"> We head outside.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:16.40" data-timestamp="3196.4"> But you feel like it's your country, but your identity here isn't that of a French person. It's that of an outsider.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:53:22.21" data-timestamp="3202.21"> I know. And I think that's what it is to be Project Girl. I was always an outsider. And I feel most inside right now where I'm most outside. Go figure. [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:53:39.28" data-timestamp="3219.28"></p><p begin="00:53:41.15" data-timestamp="3221.15">That's what freedom is, though. It's not about nothing left to lose. It's about nothing left to be. You don't have to be anything.</p><p begin="00:53:52.28" data-timestamp="3232.28">I was just thinking about it this morning. It's like, I'm an outsider. I will always be a foreigner, no matter how good my French gets. I will never really be French, no matter how much of a wannabe I am. And yet I feel that I'm home. I'm just home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:13.13" data-timestamp="3253.13"> Around the corner from the Cafe Flore is where the author James Baldwin lived for a while. Janet says she feels like she understands a little of how he must have felt, coming from Harlem, from a family that was always struggling, and then arriving here. Everything is so pretty and so much easier than home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Janet Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:54:27.02" data-timestamp="3267.02"> Here we are. This is where James Baldwin lived, with that painter, 56 Rue Jacob. But see, he lived way up in the top, on the top floor.</p><p begin="00:54:37.61" data-timestamp="3277.61">[INAUDIBLE]. One, two, three, four, fifth floor. It's obviously a walk-up. The cheapest apartments are always on the top because you have to walk farther.</p><p begin="00:54:46.47" data-timestamp="3286.47">And that's where he was. Wow. He probably even mailed letters at that post office down there. He mailed letters back to Harlem. Hey, and here we are.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:03.57" data-timestamp="3303.57"> Baldwin, of course, decided to settle in France permanently. And when Janet first moved Paris, she thought it would just be for a few years. And now, every time she goes home, she sees too much about the United States that she just does not want to deal with anymore. And she's realizing she may never move back.</p><p begin="00:55:33.01" data-timestamp="3333.01">[MUSIC - JAY-Z AND KANYE WEST, "NIGGAS IN PARIS"]</p><p begin="00:55:36.96" data-timestamp="3336.96"></p></div> </div>

Contributing editors for today's program, Paul Tough, Jack Hitt, Margy Rochlin, Alix Spiegel, Nancy Updike, and consigliere Sarah Powell. Additional production on our rerun from Aviva DeKornfeld, Jessica Lussenhop, Katharine Raimondo, Stowe Nelson, and Matt Tierney.</p><p begin="00:56:09.87" data-timestamp="3369.87">Today's program was first broadcast in the year 2000. You can no longer smoke indoors all over Paris. And I hate the fact that I have to say this. Janet McDonald, the writer of <i>Project</i> <i>Girl,</i> who is so wonderful in the third act of the show, and who I kept in touch with after the program, she died in 2007 at the age of 53. Her book is still available.</p><p begin="00:56:31.18" data-timestamp="3391.18">Eric Satie music was played for us on the accordion by Dean Olsher. Jad Abumrad recorded him. Other musical help today came from the amazing John Connors, Nikki Rinkus, and Kathie Berquist. Special thanks today to Steven Barclay, author of the book <i>A</i> <i>Place</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>World</i> <i>Called</i> <i>Paris,</i> and to James Campbell, whose book <i>Exiled</i> <i>in</i> <i>Paris,</i> was a useful summary of all the facts surrounding Richard Wright and James Baldwin's years in Paris. Also, thanks to Sandrine Rastello and [? Catherine ?] Johnstone.</p><p begin="00:56:55.18" data-timestamp="3415.18">Our website is ThisAmericanLife.org, where you can hear our archive of nearly 700 episodes for absolutely free.
