<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.61" data-timestamp="0.61"> Some people, they read those old stories from 3,000 years ago, <i>The</i> <i>Iliad</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Odyssey.</i> They read them in school, and it just gets to them. One of the producers here at our show, Emanuele, was like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:00:14.17" data-timestamp="14.17"> I loved the heroes, Hector. I thought Agamemnon was such a diva. I loved <i>The</i> <i>Aeneid.</i> We had to translate it in my Latin class. And in addition to translating passages, I decided to make, like, a 9x3 foot mural out of magazine paper depicting Aeneas' journey into hell.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:35.02" data-timestamp="35.02"> Wait, when you say magazine paper, you mean you're cutting letters out of a magazine, like a serial killer?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:00:38.08" data-timestamp="38.08"> I mean, I was-- no, I mean, I was meticulously ripping teeny pieces of different colors of magazine paper and making, like, a mosaic basically.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:47.22" data-timestamp="47.22"> Oh, I see.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:00:48.79" data-timestamp="48.79"> And I remember that J.Lo was on the mural for some reason, because she was wearing, like, a white dress that kind of looked Grecian, so.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:56.59" data-timestamp="56.59"> It was like a toga-y dress.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:00:57.93" data-timestamp="57.93"> Yeah, yeah, yeah. So she got to be Dido in hell.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:01.36" data-timestamp="61.36"> When a teacher assigned a 20-page research paper on any subject in the world, like they could do anything at all, it was obvious to Emanuele what to do-- the story of Troy, the place where the Trojan War happened, the walled city that they pulled the Trojan horse into.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:01:15.79" data-timestamp="75.79"> And in doing research for this project, I found out about this guy named Heinrich Schliemann.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:20.35" data-timestamp="80.35"> Heinrich Schliemann, a man who also read those old stories and got obsessed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:01:25.36" data-timestamp="85.36"> He's born in Germany in the 1800s. He's like a business man, a merchant in Russia. And then he moved to California during the Gold Rush and opened a bank. It's said that he would carry around, like, copies of <i>Homer.</i> And he taught himself ancient Greek.</p><p begin="00:01:41.63" data-timestamp="101.63">Like in two years, he taught himself ancient Greek, which is insane to me, just so he could read the books in the language of origin. Anyway, but basically, he amasses this huge fortune. And once he has this fortune, he decides that he's going to find Troy. At the time, people weren't sure if it was a real place or just, like, a story, like Atlantis.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:05.87" data-timestamp="125.87"> And I know this is kind of a dumb question, but in that period, did archaeologists even exist? Was that even a job yet?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:02:13.18" data-timestamp="133.18"> It's not really a job. It's like a very new field, this whole idea of digging up the past. And so there are like sort of hobbyists dabbling in it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:23.58" data-timestamp="143.58"> But these hobbyists by the 1870s have figured out from various geographic clues that Homer gives in the text about Troy's proximity to the Dardanelles and to Mount Ida. They figured out where a likely location for the city might be. It was in the place that we now call Turkey. And at that spot was kind of a big mound of dirt. And Schliemann gets going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:02:42.31" data-timestamp="162.31"> So he starts to dig. He hires dozens and dozens of workers. And when he's digging, he starts to find basically like these layers of cities that are sort of built on top of each other. So there's bits of pottery and foundations of buildings. When a city burned to the ground, they would just build another city right on top of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:00.85" data-timestamp="180.85"> Right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:03:02.24" data-timestamp="182.24"> But none of them are what he's looking for. What he is looking for is he wants to find basically gold, silver, and bronze. That's the thing he thinks is going to be the signifier that this is Troy. Because he's thinking of this treasure rich city that Homer describes in <i>The</i> <i>Iliad.</i> And he's also thinking that, well, it's got to be further down. It has to be at the bottom, right? Troy is going to be at the bottom of this pile. And so he keeps digging.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:28.99" data-timestamp="208.99"> And he keeps finding more and more layers with cities.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:03:31.27" data-timestamp="211.27"> Yes. And then he gets to the bottom of these piles of cities. And that's where he finds this treasure. He finds exactly what he's looking for. He finds this gold. He finds the silver. He finds bronze. He calls it Priam's treasure, Priam being the king of Troy in <i>The</i> <i>Iliad.</i> He says--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:50.35" data-timestamp="230.35"> But there's nothing on it that says, like, Priam's--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:03:52.37" data-timestamp="232.37"> He didn't write his name.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.76" data-timestamp="232.76"> You've reached Priam's bank or something. No, OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:03:55.93" data-timestamp="235.93"> No. No, nothing like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:58.24" data-timestamp="238.24"> He doesn't have hard proof that it's Troy. He doesn't find writing, which would have really helped. Can I ask one question?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:04:05.32" data-timestamp="245.32"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:05.62" data-timestamp="245.62"> Did he find a huge wooden horse? 'Cause that would have nailed it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:04:11.14" data-timestamp="251.14"> No huge wooden horse. Wouldn't have survived.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:14.27" data-timestamp="254.27"> Hm. OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:04:14.83" data-timestamp="254.83"> I'm sorry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:15.45" data-timestamp="255.45"> Fine.</p><p begin="00:04:22.86" data-timestamp="262.86">Today's show is about the inadvertent things that happen when you start digging up the past. And this is the point where Schliemann's story gets more complicated. Schliemann announces to the world that he's found the city that Homer was writing about. He's found Troy. He becomes internationally famous.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:04:36.66" data-timestamp="276.66"> But the truth of the situation is, is that the Troy at the bottom of the pile, with all this treasure and all this gold, that actually was not Troy. It was not Homer's Troy, at least. Like, that's from thousands of years before Troy would have even happened. The Troy that he was looking for was actually one of the cities that he had just dug through and destroyed in the process of digging through it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:04.96" data-timestamp="304.96"> So in other words, he's just digging down. He reaches Troy. He's like, no, no, this isn't it-- throws it on the side as, like, debris.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:05:11.67" data-timestamp="311.67"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:12.18" data-timestamp="312.18"> That's garbage.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:05:12.96" data-timestamp="312.96"> Yeah. And basically, he destroyed a big chunk of the ancient city in trying to find the city.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:20.52" data-timestamp="320.52"> The Troy he was looking for archaeologists understand now was just three layers down, and he dug nine layers down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Emanuele Berry</h4><p begin="00:05:27.45" data-timestamp="327.45"> So what this means is that for any archaeologist today who's trying to figure out anything that's going on at Troy, he kind of screwed them over. I called one of these guys. His name is Brian Rose, and he was the co-director of excavations at Troy for 25 years. He's not a fan of Schliemann.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Rose</h4><p begin="00:05:46.35" data-timestamp="346.35"> So he didn't really know what he was doing. So there's a lot of information that we've lost on account of his speed and digging. When I look through his notebooks, he'll say something like, "Byzantine building and debris found today, dismantled." Now that doesn't tell me if it's early, middle, late Byzantine, what the building looked like. Was it many rooms? Was it only one room? What did he find there?

<h3>Act One: Family Plot</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:31.08" data-timestamp="511.08"> Act One, Family Plot. We move now from the losers of the Trojan War to the winners-- or anyway, the descendants of the winners, the people of Greece. Here's something you probably didn't know about Greece. They don't have enough cemetery space. And cremation is not very popular there. So what they do is, when you die, you're buried in the ground.</p><p begin="00:08:51.95" data-timestamp="531.95">And then three or four years later, your family gets together and digs up your bones. Get you out of the ground, give the space to somebody else. One of the producers of our show, Lina Misitzis, her parents were both born in Greece. And she traveled there in September with them to do this for the very first time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:09:09.54" data-timestamp="549.54"> We're in a rental car driving from Athens to a small village in the south called Stoupa. It's about four hours away. My dad's driving. I'm in the front seat. Mom's in the back. We're on our way to Stoupa to exhume my grandmother, my father's mom. My dad's talking about the cost of gas, how much money it'll cost to keep this car full of gas, also other things about gas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:09:33.22" data-timestamp="573.22"> There's no gas station here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:09:35.90" data-timestamp="575.9"> I recognize this conversation not for its content, but for its design. My dad, an extraordinarily kind and thoughtful person, he fills so much space with small talk. I hate small talk. Today, September 19th, is my mom's 66th birthday. We weren't supposed to exhume my grandmother on my mom's birthday. It was supposed to happen tomorrow. But because of forecasted rain, we're doing it today.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:10:01.35" data-timestamp="601.35"> What a gift for my birthday.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:10:04.50" data-timestamp="604.5"> This will not be the last time she brings up her birthday. My grandmother spent the last third of her life dying. Her disorder was never successfully diagnosed. It kind of looked like Parkinson's. It kind of looked like Huntington's. But it was neither of those things. A caretaker, a distant cousin named Crisoula, would come and change her diapers twice a day, feed her baby food. Growing up, I was kind of afraid of my grandma. She'd lost her ability to speak, and she just kind of looked at me, and moaned, and cried.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:10:40.41" data-timestamp="640.41"> It's called chorea. When you have it, you cannot control your movements. You have jerking, uncontrollable movements of your hands and face.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:10:51.48" data-timestamp="651.48"> And chorea is actually a Greek word, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:10:54.77" data-timestamp="654.77"> Chorea, yeah.

He went alone. I figured he'd be doing the second funeral, this reverse funeral, alone, too. And while I don't know what this process looks like at all, the thought of my dad exhuming his mother's body by himself, it just sounded sad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:11:30.60" data-timestamp="690.6"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:11:32.15" data-timestamp="692.15"> And so a few months ago, I decided I wanted to go with him. To be there for him. In my fantasy of it I'd be by his side, holding his hand, patient, curious even. Which isn't how it usually goes between us. My dad doesn't talk about his feelings too often. Half the time, I think he doesn't even know what they are. But then when I'm around him, I get impatient.</p><p begin="00:11:56.61" data-timestamp="716.61">I guess this moment just seems really big, like a chance for us to be different with each other. But then when my mom found out that I was going, she decided that she would come, too. She doesn't want to pass up a chance to see me. She agrees to sit in the backseat while I try talking to my dad about what we're on our way to go do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:12:15.76" data-timestamp="735.76"> In general, I'm not very comfortable in cemeteries.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:12:18.85" data-timestamp="738.85"> Why not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:12:19.82" data-timestamp="739.82"> I don't know.

The woman who took care of my grandmother, Crisoula, is waiting for us in her yard. I haven't seen her in five or six years. She brings us cool water, keeps remarking on how absolutely different I look. I wouldn't recognize you anywhere, she says. Then a different family friend, Sotiroula, walks into the yard and joins us. You look exactly the same, she tells me. You haven't aged at all. So much of what there is to talk about is how old each of us is, what age looks like on us, and how we all wear it.</p><p begin="00:14:58.59" data-timestamp="898.59">An hour later, we walk to the graveyard. It's me, my mom, my dad, Crisoula, and Sotiroula. Crisoula is carrying recycled plastic water bottles full of vinegar. She's also carrying small white brushes, the kinds you used to scrub dirty pots and pans. The village we're in looks like a caricature of a Mediterranean village. The roads aren't paved. The homes are all stone.</p><p begin="00:15:23.02" data-timestamp="923.02">You can see the Mediterranean Sea and the Taygetos Mountains from anywhere. The graveyard is connected to the church, which is connected to the school. Everything is dusty. The graves are all white. The buildings are all white.</p><p begin="00:15:41.44" data-timestamp="941.44">The grave digger is already at my grandmother's grave. He's wearing blue overalls and a yellow T-shirt. He has on a Yankees cap. His name is Arturo. Baseball isn't really a thing in this country. I can't imagine where he got the hat. My mom walks to the opposite end of the cemetery, where she sits down on a stranger's grave beneath some shade.</p><p begin="00:16:03.67" data-timestamp="963.67">She doesn't want to see my grandmother's body, she says. It's a small cemetery, just a few dozen graves. And they're all so loved, which makes sense. No one is buried for long here, so as long as the body's in the ground, people come to visit. Each plot has photos on it, bottles of beer, and liquor, potted plants, candles, many of them lit. My dad hobbles around, inspecting the other graves to see who else has died since the last time he was here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:16:32.11" data-timestamp="992.11"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:16:36.13" data-timestamp="996.13"> Whenever he recognizes a name, he confirms with Crisoula that yes, the person whose name is written on the gravestone is, in fact, dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:16:44.62" data-timestamp="1004.62"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crisoula</h4><p begin="00:16:45.74" data-timestamp="1005.74"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:16:47.74" data-timestamp="1007.74"> One of the graves is occupied by the priest who blessed my grandmother's body just a few years ago at her funeral.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crisoula</h4><p begin="00:16:54.22" data-timestamp="1014.22"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:16:55.96" data-timestamp="1015.96"> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lina Misitzis</h4><p begin="00:16:57.13" data-timestamp="1017.13"> "But I just saw him," my dad says, "at my mother's funeral.

Such a strange way to say, I hope your grandmother's flesh and organs have finished decomposing. My taxi driver who picked me up from the airport in Athens told me that at his aunt's exhumation, he'd had to wash the residual skin and blood off of her bones, which is a thought so unnerving, I don't think I fully fathomed it. Still, I stand beside the grave digger, defiant, as though to say, even if none of you are going to look, I'm going to look.</p><p begin="00:17:44.02" data-timestamp="1064.02">For more than an hour, there's nothing to look at. Arturo's just shoveling out rocks and dirt, placing it all in a pile at the foot of the grave. And I stand there, sweating, waiting for whatever is going to happen. My mom keeps sitting on her shady grave. My dad keeps reading the names off of headstones, though he's running out of names he recognizes. Growing up, this village, like the rest of Greece, was homogeneous. Everyone was related to everyone.

My grandmother's eye sockets are filled with dirt. Crisoula rubs her skull clean with a scrubby brush. She holds it up to us to look at, pointing out my grandmother's gold teeth, still intact.

<h3>Act Two: Next of Kindle</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:12.48" data-timestamp="1692.48"> Act Two, Next of Kindle. So our show today is about people unburying the past. And when people leave us, they don't just leave behind physical objects. Bim Adewunmi talked to a man about a digital excavation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:28:27.31" data-timestamp="1707.31"> Gloria Wayne was a voracious reader. Her son, Dave, has vivid memories of when he was six or seven, going with her to the library in the whirl, in Northwest England. They made a trip to Haswell Library every couple of weeks, returning and replenishing her stack of borrowed Mills and Boon novels. It was a habit Gloria maintained all through her long life. And so for Christmas, back in 2011, her sons got her a gift to aid in that habit-- a Kindle.</p><p begin="00:28:56.29" data-timestamp="1736.29">Gloria was suspicious of online security in general, so they paid her Kindle with Dave's existing account and added an unlimited subscription so she could read whatever she wanted whenever she wanted to read it. Earlier this year, Gloria died. She was 83 years old. I spoke to Dave on the phone about his mom, and we talked about the weird life admin that suddenly becomes super important after such a loss.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:29:22.06" data-timestamp="1762.06"> One of the first things that occurred to me, even though it may be the most insignificant, was that my mum hated wasting money. She would absolutely go mad if she thought that the next month's subscription was to come out, and she wasn't around to use it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:29:36.80" data-timestamp="1776.8"> So only hours after she'd gone and still in a daze, Dave went to do the responsible thing, the thing he knew his mom would approve of-- cancel the Kindle subscription.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:29:47.56" data-timestamp="1787.56"> And then I thought, well, just for old time's sake, let's have a look at what was there. So I clicked on to Library, and there before me I found 3,046 books. In the time period between Christmas 2011 when we bought the Kindle to her said passing on April 16th, she had purchased over 3,000 books, which was quite remarkable, really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:30:16.80" data-timestamp="1816.8"> Dave had had an idea of his mom's literary interests. Her bookshelves contained a good amount of romance novels of the sort he remembered from childhood. He also used to get email notifications every so often. Remember, his account was linked to her Kindle all these years, but he didn't really pay attention to what his mother was buying. Romance novels, he'd kind of expected. But--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:30:38.88" data-timestamp="1838.88"> But what there was, was a number of-- I'm trying to put diplomatically really-- should we say, erotica. It was just erotica.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:30:50.97" data-timestamp="1850.97"> And it wasn't just the vanilla stuff. It was a real pick and mix of sexual expression. If you're listening with kids right now, don't worry. This is not in any way X rated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:31:01.53" data-timestamp="1861.53"> I mean, not wanting to throw a whole cornucopia of acronyms at you, but there were MFM, MFF, FFM, triple MF, all kinds of different combinations of relationships and sexual encounters, which was quite staggering, to be honest. You know, there was no one aspect. There was no one peccadillo that she got drawn to. It was a whole variety.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:31:30.73" data-timestamp="1890.73"> Dave tweeted about both his mother's passing and his inadvertent inheritance of a library of what he described tongue in cheek as magnificently epic sleaze. He concluded it with a tribute of sorts. "Mother," he wrote, "I raise a glass."</p><p begin="00:31:47.30" data-timestamp="1907.3">Discovering the library made Dave curious. He and his mother shared similar tastes in music and film. Maybe there would be unlikely common ground here, too. He decided to make a project of his discovery. He would delve into his mother's virtual stack of saucy literature-- his words-- and maybe find one more thing they had in common. It wasn't especially taxing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:32:09.43" data-timestamp="1929.43"> You know, it was only a fairly short kind of thing. It was a 90-minute endeavor. So for 100 days on the run, I read a book each day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:32:23.32" data-timestamp="1943.32"> Do you have a favorite title? Was there any title that stuck out to you as just either abominably bad or actually fantastically good?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:32:31.33" data-timestamp="1951.33"> Probably a bit of both, to be honest. And that's, without doubt, <i>Spanked</i> <i>by</i> <i>the</i> <i>Italian</i> <i>Mob.</i></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:32:37.14" data-timestamp="1957.14"> [LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:32:39.79" data-timestamp="1959.79">Superb.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:32:40.24" data-timestamp="1960.24"> Because it does what it says on the page. It is literally about a girl who wants to be spanked by the Italian mob. And that's the beginning, middle, and the end. I mean, the whole series, to be honest, of <i>Spanked</i> <i>by</i> books. There's about six or seven--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:32:59.98" data-timestamp="1979.98"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:33:00.37" data-timestamp="1980.37"> --with this poor girl being spanked by a variety of men.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:33:04.33" data-timestamp="1984.33"> I checked out the series, by the way. It's by Alexis Starr. The actual title Dave is thinking about is <i>Spanked</i> <i>by</i> <i>the</i> <i>Irish</i> <i>Mob.</i> Each book features a heroine looking for a spanking and getting it from the Yakuza, a Navy SEAL, an unaffiliated mob boss, and others. As Dave read more books, he found himself enjoying some of them enough that he started to have a few favorites.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:33:28.83" data-timestamp="2008.83"> <i>Opposing</i> <i>Briefs</i> was an MM romance that was quite fascinating.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:33:33.09" data-timestamp="2013.09"> That's great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:33:34.50" data-timestamp="2014.5"> I quite liked the playful nature of the title. That was written by Ian Finn. I did like that a great deal. And a one called-- one written by Anyah Omah, called <i>Sexsomnia,</i> <i>Sleepless</i> <i>in</i> <i>Manhattan.</i> And that was very good indeed as well, which was a lighter tone and slightly less of an explicit nature to it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:33:56.07" data-timestamp="2036.07"> Now that the 100 book challenge is over, Dave has kept his mom's subscription going, and he's still reading her books. They're a reminder that his mom was more than just his mom. She was a real whole person with her own quiet obsessions.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:34:10.14" data-timestamp="2050.14"> In reading these books, do you feel is it helping? Is it, in any way, a balm for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave</h4><p begin="00:34:16.87" data-timestamp="2056.87"> Yeah, because it keeps her spirit present. You find yourself almost having a conversation, why do you read them? You read a particularly horrific and explicit line. You think, good grief, mother, what were you doing? So yeah, it does tend to extend that relationship. And while we can never reverse what happened, it does keep her memory more vivid.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bim Adewunmi</h4><p begin="00:34:48.33" data-timestamp="2088.33"> According to Dave, his mom was a homebody. And in her eighth decade, after a lifetime of working hard, Gloria liked to stay home, watch a bit of <i>Murder</i> <i>She</i> <i>Wrote,</i> and enjoy her smutty novels. Finding her library is a confirmation that his mom always did whatever the hell she wanted. And more than anything else, it just makes him admire her more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:17.25" data-timestamp="2117.25"> Bim Adewunmi is one of the producers of our show.

<h3>Act Three: A Curious Bone</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:34.61" data-timestamp="2134.61"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, Digging Up the Bones-- stories of people unearthing things from the past, trying to make sense of them. We've arrived at Act Three of our show. Act Three, The Case of the Curious Bone. David Kestenbaum has this story about a man obsessed with a single bone, a bone that is inexplicably large, really just too big to make any sense out of at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:35:57.65" data-timestamp="2157.65"> It was a fragment of a bone, so old it had turned to stone. The man trying to puzzle it out was a naturalist and professor in England named Robert Plot. He writes about it in this beautiful meticulous book, <i>The</i> <i>Natural</i> <i>History</i> <i>of</i> <i>Oxfordshire,</i> published in 1677. "The curious bone," he writes, "was," quote, "dug out of a quarry in the parish of Cornwall and given to me by the ingenious Sir Thomas Pennyston." He writes that it seemed to be some part of a thigh bone, except way too big. It measured 2 feet and weighed almost 20 pounds.</p><p begin="00:36:29.94" data-timestamp="2189.94">This is the 1600s, and no one in the world had a good explanation for a bone that big. Plot writes for almost nine pages in his book about the strange bone, and he is methodical in trying to reason out what the heck it is. First, he considers the possibility that maybe it's not a bone at all, but just some natural rock formation. Which is admirable. It's so easy to jump to conclusions.</p><p begin="00:36:54.57" data-timestamp="2214.57">But the more he studies it, it really does seem to be part of a colossal bone. He writes that it has the capita femoris inferiora and, quote, "the seat of the strong ligament that rises out of the thigh and gives safe passage to the vessels descending into the leg." And then inside the bone, there is what looks like marrow. He can see the marrow preserved inside. But what in the world was it from? Quote, "It will be hard to find an animal proportional to it," he writes.</p><p begin="00:37:25.15" data-timestamp="2245.15">He runs through the possibilities, eliminating them one by one. Horse, oxen, too small. He considers something other people have suggested, that maybe the bone is from an elephant, perhaps brought over during the Roman invasions, back around 50 AD. He spends two pages on this possibility, but it seems unlikely to him. He's clearly read through lots of historical accounts.</p><p begin="00:37:48.95" data-timestamp="2268.95">Quote, "Suetonius in his life, where he is very particular concerning this expedition into Britain, mentions no such matter. There was one elephant, 'tis true," he writes, "sent as a present to King Henry the Third from the King of France in the year 1255, and perhaps two or three other elephants brought to England for show since then. But," quote, "whether it be likely any of these should be buried at Cornwall, let the reader judge. Also, if the bone is from an elephant," he writes, "where are the tusks?"</p><p begin="00:38:17.44" data-timestamp="2297.44">Finally, as he's writing it, he explains that an actual live elephant comes to town, which he examines and decides, no. Elephant thigh bone-- completely different shape. Definitely not elephant. And here, you can feel him starting to piece things together. He's on the edge of seeing this thing. He mentions other large bones. After the great fire in London in 1666, under the wreckage of St. Mary Will Church, quote, "there was found a thigh bone, now to be seen at the King's Head Tavern in Greenwich in Kent, much bigger and longer than ours."</p><p begin="00:38:52.10" data-timestamp="2332.1">And also, people had been finding unusually large teeth. In fact, people had been finding unusually large bones for centuries. There's one account by a Chinese scholar from the 300s BC, but none had a satisfying explanation.</p><p begin="00:39:06.23" data-timestamp="2346.23">It is remarkable reading Robert Plot's book to think how close he was to such a stunning fact about life on this planet. But you can know a lot and still not see. Sometimes you don't even know what you can't see. You just can't imagine the possibility of it, even when you were holding the thing in your hand. By the end of the section of the book, Plot has reasoned out the one remaining possibility, the only thing that makes any sense to him. The bones, they must have come from giants-- people just a little bigger. Which, I have to say, is way more sensible than the truth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:51.66" data-timestamp="2391.66"> David Kestenbaum is the executive editor of our program. Robert Plot died in 1696. People didn't figure out the whole dinosaur thing for another 100 years. The bone Plot puzzled over was lost a long time ago, but from the drawings, scientists think that it was a Megalosaurus that lived in Cornwall some 170 million years before him, and yes, a thigh bone.</p></div> </div>

It was a happy marriage.</p><p begin="00:40:44.31" data-timestamp="2444.31">That's one way to tell the story. Here's another. Jill's husband died a few years ago. They met in 1970 when Jill was 16 and he was 47. She was a student, and one evening after class, he kissed her. They started sleeping together. You might call him a predator or say he abused his power, but everything turned out OK. It was a happy marriage.</p><p begin="00:41:09.76" data-timestamp="2469.76">Jill's a writer. Her full name is Jill Ciment. And years ago, when she was in her 40s, she published a memoir that told the story the first way. Now she's writing that story again and considering it from the second angle. Not to correct the record-- she's trying to understand why she wrote her story the way she did. The first memoir is called <i>Half</i> <i>a</i> <i>Life.</i> The one she's writing now is called <i>The</i> <i>Other</i> <i>Half.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:41:33.10" data-timestamp="2493.1"> When I wrote <i>Half</i> <i>a</i> <i>Life</i> originally, I wrote this thing from the depths of my heart. I was supposedly telling the truth, which I really deeply believed I was. But with the beginning of the Me Too movement, it was a kind of catalyst that made me think, what if I told my story again from this vantage point, from the vantage point of me being 66 and the vantage point of the world having completely changed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:42:02.32" data-timestamp="2522.32"> Jill knew exactly where she wanted to start-- by writing down the story of their first kiss. What she wrote about it when she was in her 40s is not how she remembers it today. Here's what she remembers today. The night of that kiss, Jill and Arnold, her teacher, were in an art studio. It was an evening class. Most of the other students were retirees. The class had ended, and Jill was alone with Arnold.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:42:25.36" data-timestamp="2545.36"> And for the past six months, he'd been doing things like saying, I wish you were older, and not making sexual advances, but certainly making me aware he was attracted to me. And I was completely attracted to him, and all I did was fantasize about him. And so we went into his studio.</p><p begin="00:42:44.08" data-timestamp="2564.08">Supposedly, he was going to give me the names of people-- I was about to drop out of high school and move to New York to be an artist. And he was going to give me the names of other artists who would become maybe mentors or hire me as an assistant. And as we got into the room, I remember he took my wrist and pulled me towards him, and we kissed. And I look back, and I realized I hadn't written it that way, OK? I had written it as if I had been the sexual aggressor.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:43:15.96" data-timestamp="2595.96"> Could you go ahead and read how you described the scene in <i>Half</i> <i>a</i> <i>Life?</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:43:21.48" data-timestamp="2601.48"> Absolutely. "On the last night of art class, I dawdled in the hall until the other students were finished. As soon as they were gone, I slipped back into the classroom and shut the door behind me. Arnold was leaning against a window frame, arms folded, eyes shut, yawning. This time I approached him without a hint of coyness, without the spark of a blush. I unbuttoned the top three buttons of my peasant blouse, crossed the ink splattered floor, and kissed him."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:44:00.74" data-timestamp="2640.74"> Why did you write it that way in 1996?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:44:04.25" data-timestamp="2644.25"> I don't know. I think I viewed myself as-- and I always have. I viewed myself as someone who was always in charge. I never felt powerless. And so maybe a way of illustrating that was to make me the sexual aggressor, at least as far as the kiss went. But I don't honestly know. I mean, that's why I'm writing this whole book, to try to figure out why it seemed the truth then. I would never have done it purposely, OK? It did seem the truth when I wrote it in 1996. Why it seemed the truth there is what interests me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:44:47.14" data-timestamp="2687.14"> One reason it seemed like the truth was that later, when Jill and Arnold slept together for the first time, she was the one who seduced him. She's certain of that. They both were. But that first kiss--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:44:58.92" data-timestamp="2698.92"> When I look back on it, he did instigate this. And I don't know if I would have had the nerve at 16 and then later 17 to have acted upon all the things that I acted upon without him being the initial instigator.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:45:17.22" data-timestamp="2717.22"> In making yourself the instigator, were you protecting him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:45:26.36" data-timestamp="2726.36"> I don't think so. I think that I was trying to tell the truth of my own desire. I saw him. I wanted him. And I went after him. And I don't think I knew how to reconcile that with the idea that he kissed me first.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:45:47.72" data-timestamp="2747.72"> In her 40s, Jill wanted to write a love story about love across a great age span-- this kind of story. It's almost always told from a man's point of view. Jill wanted to write it from the perspective of the young woman and also not make her the victim. And even though Jill still emphatically does not see herself as a victim, some of the choices she made in writing her first memoir seem startling to her now, like her account of a letter Arnold sent her after they slept together. "Dear Jill, are you ever coming back to class?" When she didn't respond, he called her. In the first memoir, Jill plays the anecdote for laughs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:46:24.42" data-timestamp="2784.42"> The first time it's treated like, of course it's funny. What 47-year-old man is going to write a little girl at her house when her mother can open the mail? But when I rewrote it this time, what I saw was I saw a 47-year-old man having made love to a 17-year-old girl, after which he doesn't hear from her for a month. He writes a letter to her house, soliciting her again in this sort of fake love letter. And when he doesn't hear back from that little girl again, he calls her.</p><p begin="00:47:02.61" data-timestamp="2822.61">Now, in today's world, we would see that as a predator going after an underage girl. And when I think about that, I'm totally shocked. I'm shocked that I didn't see that the first time. But the end of a story really, really makes you change the beginning. And so I think that that's part of it. I think that part of the reason that I wrote it this way is because I was having a wonderful marriage. And part of the reason I wrote it this way was because in 1970, when all this stuff was happening, it wasn't as appalling for an older man to do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:47:47.60" data-timestamp="2867.6"> Back in 1970, nobody ever said to Jill that they saw anything appalling in Arnold's behavior, at least not directly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:47:54.41" data-timestamp="2874.41"> Here's the thing. I mean, I remember going to a party one time when we were first going out, where the hostess served everyone a martini and me a glass of milk. So I'm sure people noticed, OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:48:09.35" data-timestamp="2889.35"> When Jill looked back at the first book, she was struck by the part she left out-- parts of scenes, the messier, more revealing parts, but other omissions, too, ones that are more profound, like about her father, who was the exact same age as Arnold. Most of the first book is actually about Jill's father. She only meets Arnold about 2/3 of the way through. By that point, her father had moved out. She rarely saw him. He was troubled, and explosive, and incapable of emotional connection, essentially absent from her life. I found her writing about him wrenching, but weirdly incomplete.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:48:46.03" data-timestamp="2926.03"> It was just so clear that your art teacher was a substitute for your father in so many ways. And you don't write explicitly about this in <i>Half</i> <i>a</i> <i>Life.</i> And I wonder if you could talk about why.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:49:00.88" data-timestamp="2940.88"> I can't believe I didn't do it. I mean, I'm doing it now in this version. At 45, it seemed obvious. And the obvious in those days, I believed, made things less literary. God knows why, OK? But that's what I believed. And I just don't think it's true anymore. And I think the idea that a fatherless girl goes out and finds then a father and then uses that man to heal themself of having never been loved by an older man, I mean maybe I didn't know how to handle it at that age. Maybe it was impossible to do while both my father and my husband were alive.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:49:49.45" data-timestamp="2989.45"> What has reexamining your story like this done to your picture of your husband, or your memories of him, or your perception of your marriage?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:50:00.04" data-timestamp="3000.04"> Well, I mean, it changes the picture because I can't now look at him without realizing the lines that he crossed. And at the same time, I'm really glad that we crossed those lines. I really question a lot of these inferences that it is always wrong. It wasn't wrong for me. And it will never change my feelings about it being an amazing marriage.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:50:38.41" data-timestamp="3038.41"> What things do you say in the new book that might have been hard for him to read?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:50:44.77" data-timestamp="3044.77"> Oh my god, the whole thing. I mean, I would never have written this book if he was alive. I mean, it would be so hurtful. Like in <i>Half</i> <i>a</i> <i>Life,</i> he seems like he has always been a successful older man. And to describe him as somebody who had a midlife crisis and was struggling to find himself again, I think would have been really painful for him to read.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:51:15.58" data-timestamp="3075.58"> Arnold was a painter. He was struggling as an artist when Jill met him. But he flourished in the years that followed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:51:21.91" data-timestamp="3081.91"> It's interesting to hear you say that the thing Arnold would be hurt by is the depiction of him as a struggling middle-aged man, and not the questions about his role as possible predator or aggressor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:51:42.13" data-timestamp="3102.13"> I don't think he was-- I mean, I don't think he ever thought of me-- but maybe he did. Who knows, OK? I think that he never thought of me as someone who wasn't as strong as him. And so I think he would be-- I think he'd be shocked and surprised by these nuances in which I'm looking back at our relationship.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:52:08.29" data-timestamp="3128.29"> The questions Jill's asking about what she included and what she left out, about what she realizes now that she didn't back then, those questions interest me because they're questions I'm asking myself right now, too. I'm almost exactly the same age as Jill was when she wrote <i>Half</i> <i>a</i> <i>Life,</i> and I have a memoir coming out in a few months. The book tells the story of my adolescence, but I assume it reveals just as much, if not more, about who I am now at 46 than who I was at 16.</p><p begin="00:52:39.47" data-timestamp="3159.47">It's about the eating disorders that defined my teenage years, and if I'm being honest, my adulthood, too. Until recently, I'd never talked about this stuff with anyone. So in that way, the book is very exposing. But maybe what's not there is just as revealing. I know there's a lot I can't yet see, and I wanted to talk to Jill about that. I know that if I'd waited another five years, I would've understood more. And sometimes I wonder, should I have waited to tell my story until I understood it better?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:53:14.50" data-timestamp="3194.5"> But I don't think I understand my story any better than I did at 45, OK?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:53:21.04" data-timestamp="3201.04"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:53:22.45" data-timestamp="3202.45"> I look back at my 45-year-old self, and I think, oh my god, she didn't have this information. I see how young I was at 45. I look at my 45-year-old self in much the same way that my 45-year-old self looked at my 16-year-old self. And it's a kind of compassionate view of who you were before you had all the information.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:53:50.65" data-timestamp="3230.65"> Yeah. When you think about yourself at 45, how do you see your 45-year-old self now differently than she saw herself?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:54:02.96" data-timestamp="3242.96"> At that point, I was still thinking about the ascent of life. I was still moving in this forward motion. I was maybe at the height of my powers. And when I look back at that, I realized how delusional that is. What happens is you're writing at 45 from all the information experience that you've had. What I didn't have was the experience of taking my husband all the way to death.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:54:40.87" data-timestamp="3280.87"> In her new book, Jill's not just exploring the beginning of her relationship. She's writing about the end of it, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Ciment</h4><p begin="00:54:47.26" data-timestamp="3287.26"> It's the second part of sleeping with your professor. It's the part where suddenly you go from being the young lover to the caretaker. And that's an entirely different transition. Taking someone to death, that's the most extraordinary experience there is. And so in some ways, who kissed whom first seems really small in the length of this journey.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:55:18.24" data-timestamp="3318.24"> Jill always thought that the more interesting way to write memoir would be to return again and again to a monumental moment in a life, rather than telling the story in order all the way through. Revisiting a story doesn't necessarily make it any better, she says. But it does make it different. Even when we write about the past, we're always telling a story about the present, whether we mean to or not.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:51.28" data-timestamp="3351.28"> Susan Burton is one of the producers of our show.
