<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.75" data-timestamp="0.75">When you visit a refugee camp full of Muslims, you don't expect to get into a lot of conversations about pigs, but that's what happened to me. This is about a month ago. I'd barely been in the refugee camp a few hours before people started telling me stories.</p><p begin="00:00:12.02" data-timestamp="12.02">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:00:13.78" data-timestamp="13.78"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:00:15.36" data-timestamp="15.36">We've seen the pig with our own eyes. We've seen the boar. We've taken pictures of videos of it, videos of it.</p><p begin="00:00:20.14" data-timestamp="20.14">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:00:20.83" data-timestamp="20.83">We've taken a selfie with it. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:24.00" data-timestamp="24">Bassam and Farhad are 19. That's an interpreter, by the way, speaking English. This is a refugee camp in Greece called Ritsona, about an hour from Athens. It was thrown together in March by the government on an old air force base. Very quickly, they set up tents for 700 people, brought in a few dozen port-a-potties, designated an old helicopter pad as the soccer field. But it's the middle of the woods, so snakes get in the tents, and at night, wild boars do roam around. Everybody's attitude about the boars was like, seriously? We escaped a war, risked dying on these tiny boats, and now we come here and this?</p><p begin="00:00:59.41" data-timestamp="59.41">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:01:00.81" data-timestamp="60.81">It is a huge boar. It's basically as big as we are. It's this big.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:05.29" data-timestamp="65.29">OK, so this is a video. Oh look. There it is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:01:09.32" data-timestamp="69.32">Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:10.61" data-timestamp="70.61">The boars especially hang out near the toilets, and they are really big and frightening. And some people just hold it in all night rather than go. Other people, they're taking action.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mimi Karmiri</h4><p begin="00:01:21.93" data-timestamp="81.93">Over there. You see? This is a handmade trap.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:25.96" data-timestamp="85.96">Mimi Karmiri was the field coordinator running the camp, and she walked me out in the woods with one of the refugees, Abu Khair, to show me the trap that he'd built to catch the boars. It wasn't what I pictured. And what is it, a dumpster?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mimi Karmiri</h4><p begin="00:01:41.87" data-timestamp="101.87">Yes, it's a dumpster. And so he has put a piece of meat inside in order to attract the animals.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:50.01" data-timestamp="110.01">The dumpster's turned on its side, and the lid was propped open with a log so a boar could just walk right in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abu Khair</h4><p begin="00:01:55.84" data-timestamp="115.84">This open. That food to animals.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.19" data-timestamp="119.19">Abu Khair grabs the lid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abu Khair</h4><p begin="00:02:00.54" data-timestamp="120.54">If animals catch food, this closes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:05.32" data-timestamp="125.32">So basically the lid closes, and then the log comes down and holds it shut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Abu Khair</h4><p begin="00:02:10.24" data-timestamp="130.24">And this thing.</p><p begin="00:02:12.14" data-timestamp="132.14">[CLAPPING]</p><p begin="00:02:13.51" data-timestamp="133.51"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:14.43" data-timestamp="134.43">He claps his hands. I didn't say anything, but it did not seem at all clear that that lid was going to stay on with an angry, 200 pound pig inside. Before I got to Greece, I knew that there were lots of refugees there, fleeing violence from Syria, and Iraq, and Afghanistan, just like everybody had seen those photos last year of people landing in Greece by boat on their way to Germany and other European countries. Then this year, in March, one of the European nations said basically, "We're not taking you. You have to stay in Greece," to all these refugees.</p><p begin="00:02:43.92" data-timestamp="163.92">Suddenly, the poorest country in Western Europe had to figure out how to house, and feed, and care for all these people, about 57,000 of them, stuck. And Greece was really not prepared. Its government was limping along after six years of austerity measures, which means, if you haven't been following this, there have been several waves of cutbacks in government services. A fourth of the country is out of work.</p><p begin="00:03:05.82" data-timestamp="185.82">The government quickly ad hocced its way into housing for tens of thousands of people. And as a result, you have this camp in the woods with wild boars. And 130 miles away on the coast, some Syrian refugees were living in an abandoned beach resort on the Ionian Sea.</p><p begin="00:03:20.88" data-timestamp="200.88">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:03:23.58" data-timestamp="203.58">Kids play in the sand, and modestly dressed women in long sleeves, and long pants, and headscarves walk straight into the surf. Elsewhere around the country, if you want to come with me right now on a quick tour, around 1,300 Iraqis are housed in the grounds of a former psychiatric hospital near Mount Olympus. Down in Athens, 2,000 people are in two stadiums, baseball and field hockey, left over from the 2004 Olympic games.</p><p begin="00:03:49.10" data-timestamp="229.1">Somebody has spray painted a sign outside that says, in English, with arrows, "hockey, baseball, refugees." Next door to the stadiums, 1,000 people are living in an old international airport that closed back in 2001. There are departure boards, listing flights to Paris and Berlin with specific times and gates, from when it was still a functioning airport. Right nearby, the people sleeping in tents weren't going anywhere.</p><p begin="00:04:12.95" data-timestamp="252.95">Meanwhile, up north, near the Macedonian border, my colleague, <i>This American Life</i> producer Sean Cole, visited a highway rest stop that is pretty much exactly like any rest stop you would find on, like, the New Jersey turnpike or I-80 driving to Chicago. Inside, there's a convenience store with Pringles, and Oreos, and sodas. And then outside, where the gas pumps are, were pop tents with 2,000 people living in them, music playing.</p><p begin="00:04:35.58" data-timestamp="275.58">People sat around the gas pumps, chatting and smoking right there, which probably not the best idea. An eight-year-old boy walked up to Sean and his interpreter Manaf with a request.</p><p begin="00:04:45.65" data-timestamp="285.65">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:04:47.43" data-timestamp="287.43"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:04:48.41" data-timestamp="288.41">Yes, I would like to take your passport.</p><p begin="00:04:51.28" data-timestamp="291.28">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:04:52.45" data-timestamp="292.45">To go to Germany.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:04:54.05" data-timestamp="294.05">So you would pose as me?</p><p begin="00:04:56.67" data-timestamp="296.67">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:04:57.49" data-timestamp="297.49"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:05:00.89" data-timestamp="300.89">I will get the same haircut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:02.76" data-timestamp="302.76">I think they would still be able to tell the difference.</p><p begin="00:05:05.61" data-timestamp="305.61">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:06.47" data-timestamp="306.47"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:05:08.30" data-timestamp="308.3">Would you make a passport for me, then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:05:10.35" data-timestamp="310.35">I could maybe draw one.</p><p begin="00:05:12.18" data-timestamp="312.18">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:13.51" data-timestamp="313.51">What do you think about this place?</p><p begin="00:05:15.46" data-timestamp="315.46">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:05:16.38" data-timestamp="316.38"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manaf</h4><p begin="00:05:20.77" data-timestamp="320.77">It's not beautiful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:23.70" data-timestamp="323.7">This gas station camp, by the way, was not an official refugee camp set up by the state. In fact, just a few days after Sean was there, the government relocated everybody to authorized camps. To give you a sense of just how seat-of-the-pants the Greek response to the refugee crisis has been, I talked to this guy who managed a camp of about 2,000 refugees when he was there. His name is Sakis Papithemilis. He's a civil servant. He chooses his words thoughtfully. And who, by the way, has his own salary cut in half over the last four years.</p><p begin="00:05:51.28" data-timestamp="351.28">NPR'S reporter in Greece, Joanna Kakissis, introduced me to him. She guided, actually, a lot of the reporting that we did around Greece. Sakis told Joanna and me that even trying to do something straightforward in the camp that he managed, like, for example, arrange for trash pickup, he would run into an incredibly basic problem.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sakis Papithemilis</h4><p begin="00:06:09.58" data-timestamp="369.58">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:06:12.06" data-timestamp="372.06"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:13.05" data-timestamp="373.05">With the trash, for example, I couldn't organize the trash being picked up, because legally the camp didn't exist.

<h3>Act One: Field of Interrupted Dreams</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:13.35" data-timestamp="613.35">Act 1, Field of Interrupted Dreams. So one good place to see how the Greeks' ad hoc response is working is at the baseball stadium in Athens. About a fourth of the refugees in Greece are from Afghanistan, and about 1,000 of them were brought into this abandoned stadium that was left over from the Olympics. The infield was all dirt. One of our producers, Miki, went there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:10:33.01" data-timestamp="633.01">Here's how you turn a baseball stadium into a refugee camp. Out in the door of the infield and the outfield you set up 150 white tents. They're standard issue from the UN. At the concession stand, give out rations. Right behind home plate, there's a press box. Make that the office. For bathrooms, use the locker rooms behind the dugouts. There's one for men and one for women. The women's is way cleaner.</p><p begin="00:10:58.74" data-timestamp="658.74">We're walking to the women's area.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:00.38" data-timestamp="660.38">The women are very organized. They have a list. They clean the bathrooms twice a day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:04.55" data-timestamp="664.55">The women?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:05.43" data-timestamp="665.43">Men are not better organized. We have to drag them to clean their bathroom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:09.53" data-timestamp="669.53">One of the camps managers, Anna Agriteli, is giving me a tour. She has big brown hair pulled into a ponytail. She's Greek. So we're just walking into the locker room. And the floors are a little flooded, so we're just walking through a pool water. All the lockers and benches have been ripped out. And over in the showers, women are squatting with buckets full of water and clothing.</p><p begin="00:11:34.73" data-timestamp="694.73">11 showers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:37.03" data-timestamp="697.03">Now they're washing their clothes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:38.84" data-timestamp="698.84">Laundry, they're doing laundry now. So does this just get flooded just from the people doing their laundry?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:43.76" data-timestamp="703.76">Their laundry, yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:45.51" data-timestamp="705.51">OK. I counted 12 toilets. Only six were working. This was for 300 women and about 200 girls. Did you ever go to a baseball game during the Olympics?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:11:56.53" data-timestamp="716.53">No. We are not big fans of baseball in Greece. We don't even know baseball.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:12:11.34" data-timestamp="731.34">Most of the refugees stay out of their tents during the day, because they're too hot. They're totally exposed on the field, no shade. Temperatures right now reach into the 90s. So lots of people hang out in the upper levels of the stadium seats, because they're partially covered by an overhanging roof. They also crowd around any electrical outlet they can find to charge phones or plug in electric tea pots. The Olympics were held here. I keep thinking that.</p><p begin="00:12:37.37" data-timestamp="757.37">Anna is in charge of everything in the stadium, everything-- a woman who didn't get shampoo when they handed it out, the broken toilets. The day I was there, they didn't have enough drinking water and baby formula to get through the coming week. She takes me over to homebase, where they built a prototype cover for the tents, these giant pieces of green sheer fabric stretched over a tent to try and cool it down in the sun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:13:00.06" data-timestamp="780.06">This is sample.

Before this, she worked as a production assistant at a theater company.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:25.55" data-timestamp="805.55">Is there anything that you learned in that job that's useful in this job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:13:30.14" data-timestamp="810.14">No. But maybe the production, the crazy hours that you work in the production, that's the same, and that you have to devise a solution for every crazy thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:40.67" data-timestamp="820.67">Situations that come up, you have to, like, work on the fly.

Then they took charge. They worked long hours. They don't really take days off. And they set a tone at the camps. The government doesn't want the camps to feel like prisons. People can come and go. And having these young women in charge helps with that. They don't act like guards or bosses. They're just bad asses and sweethearts. Anna and the other woman who runs this stadium are constantly making these little jokes and laughing with everyone. Every few steps on our tour, Anna got stopped.</p><p begin="00:14:53.42" data-timestamp="893.42">[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]</p><p begin="00:14:55.58" data-timestamp="895.58"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:14:57.01" data-timestamp="897.01">Do you get hugs a lot?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:14:57.86" data-timestamp="897.86">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:14:59.72" data-timestamp="899.72">How many times a day or do you think you get hugged?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:15:01.82" data-timestamp="901.82">Too many, too many, too many.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:03.51" data-timestamp="903.51">Well, I guess there's worse things people can do than hug you, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Anna Agriteli</h4><p begin="00:15:06.25" data-timestamp="906.25">Yes, yes.

That's my kids in the orange life jackets.</p><p begin="00:29:17.85" data-timestamp="1757.85">I suppose if you visit war zones all the time, this is nothing new.

But it was always jolting.</p><p begin="00:29:36.69" data-timestamp="1776.69">The interview that I did that gave me the best picture of what it's like to be a parent in the camps and the particular ways that it affected different members of a family to be here was an interview with a woman named Aziza Bashar. She's well dressed, even here, with a stylish hijab, a red and navy plaid button down jacket, and a steamlined navy skirt. It's like, what little she can control, she does.</p><p begin="00:29:58.92" data-timestamp="1798.92">Her husband's also in the camp, though he waved me off when I tried to talk to him. She's the one who makes the decisions for the family, who marched them out of a war zone, walking and actually sometimes running she said, to a town up north where things were safer. And when things there became untenable, she moved them again to Kurdistan where they lived for a while.</p><p begin="00:30:16.81" data-timestamp="1816.81">And finally they just decided to escape to Europe. They arrived in Greece by boat, thinking they were just passing through just here for a few days. The child she worries about most of her kids is Mohammad, Hammed, they call him. He's nearly eight. When the war began, they were near Aleppo.

Next, it was the airplanes. And that became a family project. And now he's not so scared of the planes. Though the one thing they haven't been able to fix is his dreams.

It was supposed to be 35 people in a little rubber boat, but Aziza says that they packed on twice that many and didn't give out life vests. And people wanted to get off, and the smugglers pointed guns at them and said you have to go now. A few people told me stories like that.</p><p begin="00:33:20.71" data-timestamp="2000.71">They got a little ways out, and the boat started to deflate, and started to flip over, just capsized.

And the boat turned back.</p><p begin="00:33:37.12" data-timestamp="2017.12">OK, so after that, how in the world do you get your six kids onto a second boat? That requires some A level parenting moves, and Aziza was the one who had to get her kids onboard, literally onboard in this case.

Her whole family has left Syria. There's nothing for them there. Not long ago, Aziza was missing her own mother, and feeling really sad about that. And the kids noticed, and they told her, we're there for you. And they said, if we could do anything to make you happy, and they tried to cheer her up, and they made little jokes, and little funny moves, which was really sweet, and she loved it.</p><p begin="00:41:23.41" data-timestamp="2483.41">And they would try to take care of her in the way that she tries to take care of them. At the same time, she felt like, oh, it's come to this? That they're taking care of her? It's like these days when she tells them, they're still going to have a bright future. They just need to hold on. She see's them nod, like they're humoring her, pretending to agree, just to make her feel better. That does not seem good to her, she said. It doesn't seem ideal at all.</p><p begin="00:41:56.37" data-timestamp="2516.37">Coming up. So for your new life to begin, all you need is for somebody to pick up the phone when you call.

<h3>Act Three: All Our Representatives Are Currently Busy</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:40.92" data-timestamp="2560.92">We've arrived at Act 3 of our program, Act 3. All our representatives are currently busy.</p><p begin="00:42:46.96" data-timestamp="2566.96">So the first step for any refugee to leave the refugee camp limbo that they're in in Greece and get relocated elsewhere in Europe, is that they need official asylum papers from Greece. And the problem is, there are too many refugees for the government office that handles this to process quickly. And fearing a situation where just like hundreds of refugees would line up every day at their office door, the asylum office in Greece set up a way for people to make appointments for their interview and their paperwork.</p><p begin="00:43:13.53" data-timestamp="2593.53">Basically, they set up a system where people could call the office on Skype. And just a word here. If you don't know what Skype is, it's like an internet phone call, like Face Time. People have it on their phones. You can call without the video also. And the asylum office made a schedule of when people could call. So for instance, people who speak Arabic got from 10:00 to noon on Mondays and 10:00 to 11:00 on Tuesdays some weeks. Dari and Farsi speakers got an hour Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.</p><p begin="00:43:40.63" data-timestamp="2620.63">And making the appointment is important, because once you have the appointment, you get access to health care, and you get a temporary permit to stay in Greece for a year. If you don't have that, they can arrest you. One of our reporters, Miki Meek, went to watch refugees make these Skype calls in Athens. This was six weeks ago.</p><p begin="00:43:55.98" data-timestamp="2635.98">Turns out, when it comes to pre-registering for asylum, like the cops say on American TV shows, you can do it the easy way, or you can do it the hard way. Here's Miki.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:44:06.14" data-timestamp="2646.14">Tens of thousands of people were in this weird situation where their entire futures were dependent on getting through on a Skype call, and they were not getting through. So they re-dialed again, and again, and again. People had been stuck doing this for months from their cell phones.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan Haidari</h4><p begin="00:44:22.62" data-timestamp="2662.62">[SPEAKING DARI]</p><p begin="00:44:25.11" data-timestamp="2665.11"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:44:26.84" data-timestamp="2666.84">I've been trying probably more than 500 times.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:44:29.31" data-timestamp="2669.31">This is Hassan Haidari, 22-years-old, and from Afghanistan.

His first call to the Greek asylum office was back in March.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:44:52.74" data-timestamp="2692.74">You're just scrolling through.

It just says, call, no answer. Call, no answer. Call, no answer. Call failed. And it just keeps going on and on like this. So that's the hard way to do these Skype calls. The easy way, it really isn't much easier. You go to an NGO's office, and you use their Skype account to call in. It's easier because your odds go up.</p><p begin="00:45:19.17" data-timestamp="2719.17">The government asylum office prioritizes calls from NGOs over random Skype callers, which is why Hassan is at the rundown office of an NGO called the Greek Forum of Refugees. He's sitting cross-legged on the ground.

Then Joanna, the NPR reporter we worked with on the show, went and visited the asylum office.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:51:39.98" data-timestamp="3099.98">It does sound incredible. The asylum office has over 350 employees, and this is the biggest thing they're working on. But it's true. The number of people manning the Skype line for all of Greece is exactly one. Her name is Katerina Maliotaki, lifetime civil servant, a big personality with black hair she's dyed bright red. She keeps a stuffed Kermit the Frog doll next to her computer that she squeezes when she gets stressed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katerina Maliotake</h4><p begin="00:52:09.06" data-timestamp="3129.06">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:52:09.89" data-timestamp="3129.89"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:52:14.29" data-timestamp="3134.29">Hello, sir. How are you? Good morning. What country are you from? Great. Thank you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:52:20.67" data-timestamp="3140.67">Katerina sits in a tiny, little office where she can barely move, with an interpreter that's right next to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katerina Maliotake</h4><p begin="00:52:26.36" data-timestamp="3146.36">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:52:27.27" data-timestamp="3147.27"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:52:31.92" data-timestamp="3151.92">I take one call after another without leaving even half a minute gap in between. Without taking a breath, my hand automatically grabs the mouse. We can't waste any time, because as we know, there are tens of thousands of refugees. Everyone is waiting on you to answer the call, and you know that you can't possibly answer all of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:52:54.35" data-timestamp="3174.35">She picks up a call from a Syrian woman. She's in a little square on the right hand side of the screen, wearing a peach headscarf.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katerina Maliotake</h4><p begin="00:53:01.78" data-timestamp="3181.78">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:53:02.71" data-timestamp="3182.71">She tells her hello. Every time Katerina answers a call, she sits up straight and smiles, even though the refugees can't see her from their end.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katerina Maliotake</h4><p begin="00:53:12.19" data-timestamp="3192.19">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:53:14.58" data-timestamp="3194.58">She tells her to look at the camera. Bravo. Wonderful. Thank you. The entire time she's processing the woman and her kids, the left side of Katerina's screen is filling up with a long line of flashing calls. Katerina estimates in a regular workday, with calls in Farsi, Dari, French, Arabic, English, she'll only register about 100 people, maybe 12 an hour. That's the best she can do.</p><p begin="00:53:41.14" data-timestamp="3221.14">So why is she the only one doing this job? Well, Greece is broke. The entire government has been on austerity for six years. There's no money to hire anyone else, and this agency is just three years old. It was never meant to handle such a big workload. The director told me they'd need to hire more than 1,000 people just to keep up.</p><p begin="00:54:02.00" data-timestamp="3242">She said, sure, they could move more people to taking Skype calls, but that would just cut the number of people processing asylum applications. One way or another, it's going to be very, very slow. Katerina says sometimes refugees yell at her when she finally picks up their call. They want to know, why have I been calling for months?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:54:21.66" data-timestamp="3261.66">I mean, what's it like knowing that thousands of people are trying to reach you, and you can only pick up a few calls at a time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katerina Maliotake</h4><p begin="00:54:32.13" data-timestamp="3272.13">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:54:34.44" data-timestamp="3274.44"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:54:36.13" data-timestamp="3276.13">It feels heavy and worrisome for us. Because you do as much as you can, with all of your heart, your strength, your expertise. But whatever you do, even in doing your best, will always be just a drop in the ocean. So this big disappointment does come over us. Because no one is satisfied.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:54:59.54" data-timestamp="3299.54">Katerina told me she read a news article about a Syrian man who dreamed all night about Skype. She switches to English to explain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katerina Maliotaki</h4><p begin="00:55:07.21" data-timestamp="3307.21">He was saying that every night he's dreaming. I'm trying to sleep, and I see in my dreams that I'm calling on Skype. And really, I wanted to tell him that, oh my friend, I have the same problem. Really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:55:33.99" data-timestamp="3333.99">So we're back at the NGO office. It's 3:55. The session ends at 4:00. My interpreter and I are the only ones in the room who feel any suspense about whether the people here will get through. Rajab, the dad who dragged his whole family here, he just looks tired. He sits on a plastic lawn chair, staring at the computer screen. Hassan Mohammed, who told me if you don't get through today, he's never coming back, he's off in the waiting room, robotically re-dialing on Skype.</p><p begin="00:56:02.22" data-timestamp="3362.22">Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Two more minutes. Two more minutes.</p><p begin="00:56:07.66" data-timestamp="3367.66">An NGO employee says to no one in particular, "moment of silence for the lost souls on Skype about to die." They haven't picked up. The time's up.</p><p begin="00:56:22.43" data-timestamp="3382.43">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:56:23.48" data-timestamp="3383.48"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:56:23.83" data-timestamp="3383.83">I mean, that's it. We're done for the day. I mean, we're done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:56:28.80" data-timestamp="3388.8">I leave the room to check in with Rajab's son, Mohammed, who's still out in the now empty hallway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohammed</h4><p begin="00:56:34.49" data-timestamp="3394.49">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:56:35.67" data-timestamp="3395.67"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:56:37.94" data-timestamp="3397.94">The entire time from 2:00 to 4:00, there is hope. Everybody's still holding on. No one wants to go on. But once that clock strikes 4:00, that's when everybody leaves. They literally, they hate everything. They hate themselves. They hate this world. They hate their kids. Like, they hate everything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:56:58.03" data-timestamp="3418.03">Does your dad know that you're not going to come back?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohammed</h4><p begin="00:57:00.29" data-timestamp="3420.29">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="00:57:01.49" data-timestamp="3421.49"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:57:01.86" data-timestamp="3421.86">No, no.

I'm done. That's it. I just want to go back to Syria. I just want to-- I just want to leave and smuggle myself back to Syria. I don't want to tell him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:57:25.91" data-timestamp="3445.91">He didn't go back to Syria. The next week, he got up, started walking to the train station at 6:00 AM, and came back to the office early enough to be first in line again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:41.30" data-timestamp="3461.3">Miki Meek. So because those Skype calls have been criticized, in the time since Miki recorded those people who were calling in, the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNHCR, has started going to camps with the Greek government to pre-register hundreds of people at a time in person, so they don't have to use Skype. And they've done tons of people this way, over 25,000 people.</p><p begin="00:58:04.95" data-timestamp="3484.95">But the problem is, these people were told when they do this, OK, you're pre-registered for asylum, but they weren't given an actual appointment. Like, they weren't given a date to come in to be interviewed and start the asylum process. An NGO staffer told us that the government tells the refugees that they'll be texted sometime in the coming year with a date. And then after that, the asylum process itself, that they're just applying for, right? That itself can take months.</p><p begin="00:58:31.67" data-timestamp="3511.67">But that's just the delay that all these people face with the local bureaucracy in Greece. The next problem they have is, although the rest of Europe has officially agreed to let in these 57,000 people into their countries, they're not doing it. Only 2,681 have been relocated out of 57,000. It's totally stalled. Apparently, the politics for any country to allow in refugees right now is too delicate to let these people in.</p><p begin="00:58:57.58" data-timestamp="3537.58">Dimitris Vitsas, who's in charge of coordinating the refugee crisis in Greece, he's the Deputy Ministry of Defense, he told me that Greece understands that these 57,000 people may not be going anywhere for a very long time. And when they finally do leave, given the situation in the world, others are probably going to show up to replace them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitris Vitsas</h4><p begin="00:59:16.74" data-timestamp="3556.74">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:59:17.95" data-timestamp="3557.95"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:18.24" data-timestamp="3558.24">Our goal is to have ready over 60,000 places where we can host refugees and migrants in central Greece--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dimitris Vitsas</h4><p begin="00:59:27.69" data-timestamp="3567.69">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:59:28.87" data-timestamp="3568.87"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:30.01" data-timestamp="3570.01">Indefinitely moving forward for the coming years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:59:33.53" data-timestamp="3573.53">Indefinitely. Now, short term, they hope to get 2/3 of the refugees, 40,000 people, out of tents and into little trailers that they call "iso boxes," which have AC, and heat, and proper kitchens, and showers, and bathrooms. And they hope to do that by September, or anyway before winter. They have money for this provided by the rest of Europe.</p><p begin="00:59:52.12" data-timestamp="3592.12">The other roughly 20,000 refugees--</p><p begin="00:59:54.98" data-timestamp="3594.98">[SPEAKING GREEK]</p><p begin="00:59:56.76" data-timestamp="3596.76"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:59:58.87" data-timestamp="3598.87">Our goal is to have 20,000 people in houses and apartments by the end of September.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:06.52" data-timestamp="3606.52">This is not only better for the refugees than living in the camps, it's great for the Greeks, because it puts money into the hands of Greek citizens. Basically, other European countries will pay Greek property owners to fix up and rent out rooms, and apartments, and houses to the refugees. The Greeks are also hoping to set up schools for refugee children by the end of September. I did talk to officials from the International Rescue Committee and UNHCR, and they applauded these ambitions, but they were deeply skeptical that Greece would actually make the goals for such large numbers of refugees.</p><p begin="01:00:39.28" data-timestamp="3639.28">But this whole plan that Greece is preparing for tens of thousands of refugees to be there for a long, long time? The refugees don't know it. People we met in the camps really had no idea, and they're trying to move ahead with parts of their lives, whatever they can. And in fact, next week on our show, we have stories of people trying to do that, like this couple that met and fell in love, even though they were not expecting anything like that to happen to them while en route from one country to another. And even though her family did not approve and tried to keep them apart, the guy in the couple was undeterred.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="01:01:13.26" data-timestamp="3673.26">[SPEAKING ARABIC]</p><p begin="01:01:14.35" data-timestamp="3674.35"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="01:01:15.43" data-timestamp="3675.43">I love her very much, and those people won't stand in our way.
