<h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.54" data-timestamp="0.54"> Some kids are at a rest stop parking lot in the middle of August, waiting to get back in the car-- Logan, William, and Kieran. A reporter approaches them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:00:08.28" data-timestamp="8.28"> I couldn't help but notice that there's three of you guys. So the first question that pops into my head is, who's going to have to ride in the middle?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:15.66" data-timestamp="15.66"> Unfortunately, me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:00:17.28" data-timestamp="17.28"> And how come you're the guy who has to ride in--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:20.07" data-timestamp="20.07"> Because those two, um, basically-- I don't know. They fight when they're in the middle. He doesn't even want to sit next to him. Ow. Stop that!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:00:27.93" data-timestamp="27.93"> He's pinching your cheek right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:29.94" data-timestamp="29.94"> Pressure pointing, actually.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:00:31.86" data-timestamp="31.86"> So do you feel like this is going to be-- this is always going to be your job? As you guys get older, you're always going to be the brother sitting in the middle, brokering the peace?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:40.98" data-timestamp="40.98"> Yeah. And basically, I'm the mediator.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:00:44.49" data-timestamp="44.49"> How do you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:46.70" data-timestamp="46.7"> I'm not sure what you're talking about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:00:49.05" data-timestamp="49.05"> How do you mean you're the mediator?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:51.75" data-timestamp="51.75"> I'm actually not sure what mediator means. I just felt like saying it. I think it means a guy who keeps peace. Like, keeping them from killing each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:01:02.06" data-timestamp="62.06"> They can use a guy like you in the Middle East maybe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:04.74" data-timestamp="64.74"> One of the little brothers signals for the microphone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Little Brother</h4><p begin="00:01:06.88" data-timestamp="66.88"> Get it? Middle East. Because he's in the middle, and he's out east. Get it? Middle East.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:23.97" data-timestamp="83.97"> There's nothing particularly notable about this rest stop. It's one of thousands all over the country, the kind of place we'd stop for 10 minutes on a holiday weekend, run inside, use the restroom, buy a burger or a coffee, head back out on the road.</p><p begin="00:01:35.29" data-timestamp="95.29">But if you stayed for more than 10 minutes, you might end up talking to one of these kids or to one of the couples who are dropping off children at college, like this reporter did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:01:43.34" data-timestamp="103.34"> --the last kid off to school, so now we're the new empty nesters right now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:01:46.82" data-timestamp="106.82"> I know. How do you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:01:48.31" data-timestamp="108.31"> I'm cooking things that I've never tried.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:01:50.54" data-timestamp="110.54"> Yeah, and I'm eating things that I've never tried.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:53.25" data-timestamp="113.25"> There's some folks on the way back from a family reunion, might complain about the traffic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:57.08" data-timestamp="117.08"> And suddenly a clown truck filled with clowns cut us off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:01.30" data-timestamp="121.3"> Or there's this guy, whose entertainment on his weekly four-hour drive isn't the radio or the CD player.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:02:06.95" data-timestamp="126.95"> Well, truthfully, so none of the police folk out there are listening, I usually read the newspaper on the way up, or a book.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:02:12.89" data-timestamp="132.89"> Are you kidding me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:02:13.69" data-timestamp="133.69"> Here and there on the way up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:02:15.80" data-timestamp="135.8"> And you've been doing it for six or seven years, and you've not had an accident?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:02:18.69" data-timestamp="138.69"> No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:02:19.34" data-timestamp="139.34"> That seems to me to be pure luck.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:25.71" data-timestamp="145.71"> There's a family driving six hours to visit their dad in prison; a young couple looking for a place to have their wedding; two brothers on the way to compete in the rodeo; a 16-year-old standing inside the rest stop nursing a tea, taking a break from her own family. She's on an eight-hour car trip with her dad, her grandma, her sister, and a couple of brothers. She explains to a reporter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:02:44.12" data-timestamp="164.12"> Well, it's very noisy, you could say that. Because everybody's arguing or talking about sports. We were just having an argument on who's better, Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson? And Mike Tyson won. So my dad nearly stopped the car to argue and say, no, Mike Tyson is better. So it was just very hectic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:02.45" data-timestamp="182.45"> Coincidentally, a little later, Mike Tyson's name comes up again, in conversation with the prep cook named Ozzy, who works at the rest stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzy</h4><p begin="00:03:09.18" data-timestamp="189.18"> Sometimes I see movie stars. I see Tyson in person.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:03:13.01" data-timestamp="193.01"> Mike Tyson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzy</h4><p begin="00:03:13.70" data-timestamp="193.7"> Mike Tyson was here. He has a tiny voice. How are you doing, man? Can I get ice cream? You know? So I see Mario Cuomo. I see this old lady who got a lot of plastic surgeries.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Reporter</h4><p begin="00:03:30.92" data-timestamp="210.92"> Joan Rivers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzy</h4><p begin="00:03:31.91" data-timestamp="211.91"> Yes, she was here, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:33.90" data-timestamp="213.9"> Poor Joan Rivers. The two strangers can get her name across simply by saying, "the old lady who got a lot of plastic surgery."</p><p begin="00:03:48.08" data-timestamp="228.08">Nine of us came to this rest stop with tape recorders on a weekend in the middle of August, all the way back in 2009. Today's show is a rerun. It was two weeks before Labor Day, the time of year when over 10,000 people pass through this rest stop each day. We thought that, for once, we would not leave after just 10 minutes.</p><p begin="00:04:04.59" data-timestamp="244.59">Stick around and find out who all these people are, where they're going, what they're thinking about. We found love stories, and hardcore partiers, and inexplicably angry people, and all kinds of others. We bring you those stories in this special hour of our show for this holiday weekend when so many of us are on the road. WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:04:34.03" data-timestamp="274.03"></p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Two: Act Two</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:35.50" data-timestamp="275.5"> The name of this particular rest stop is the Plattekill Travel Plaza. It's on the New York Thruway, I-87, about an hour and a half north of New York City on the northbound side of the highway. It's shiny and recently renovated with five restaurants in the food court-- Nathan's Hot Dog, Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips, Roy Rogers, a Canadian sandwich shop called Brioche Duree, and a Starbucks-- plus a travel mart that sells sodas, and chips and gum, and stuff like that.</p><p begin="00:04:59.45" data-timestamp="299.45">All these concessions and the cleaning crews and everything else are run by a company called HMS Host, which does this kind of thing in airports and travel plazas across the country. They have 120 employees here, and a half dozen managers, and a general manager.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:05:12.53" data-timestamp="312.53"> I think we have a very strong weekend as we get into the end of summer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:16.52" data-timestamp="316.52"> This is the general manager, Robert Woodill, a friendly, upbeat guy who carries a folded piece of paper that he pulls out and unfolds and refers to constantly through the day, which has a list of sales figures for every half hour of the day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:05:29.87" data-timestamp="329.87"> All it simply is, is it's my half hour reports of last year on this day, so I can compare my sales the last year and see where we're at. And we do it usually at, like, 11 o'clock, and then every hour or so, we take a quick reading just to see where we're at.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:43.07" data-timestamp="343.07"> And explain when is the crazy time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:05:45.38" data-timestamp="345.38"> Today, it'll be probably from, like, 12 o'clock till 7 o'clock, very solid and steady. And then tomorrow morning, it'll pick up again. And I think as we're getting to the end of summer, there's a big race in Saratoga this week. People have booked their rooms for Lake George, and it's the end of summer. People want to go and go on vacation. So I think we're going to have a good weekend.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:03.53" data-timestamp="363.53"> We did our taping on Friday and Saturday, two weeks before Labor Day, because those are the biggest days and the biggest month here. In August, the rest stop makes a fourth of its money for the whole year. And it's crucial that Robert makes his goals this weekend because it's built into the rest stop business that there are a couple months every year when he just breaks even or loses money.</p><p begin="00:06:22.58" data-timestamp="382.58">Also, he wants to do better than his rival-- his rival, a rest stop in Maine, run by a guy named Andy Tucci.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:06:29.36" data-timestamp="389.36"> Kennebunk North, usually, and I are neck and neck. And we never place any wagers, but you know, they're Red Sox fans, we're Yankee fans. And we go back and forth on that, as well as discussing who's going to have the record sales for the day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:43.30" data-timestamp="403.3"> Who won last weekend?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:06:45.16" data-timestamp="405.16"> Andy. Andy beat me red like a lobster, if you want. That's what I told him. He beat me both days, but I think I'm going to get it back this weekend, so. I hope this week, the Yankees sweep the Red Sox, and then he'll be really quiet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:57.32" data-timestamp="417.32"> Robert was fully staffed for the rush. He had his best cashiers on. And now, he just needed the crowds, the big summer weekend crowds.</p><p begin="00:07:14.56" data-timestamp="434.56">We chose this particular rest stop because, a couple years ago, I came here on the way to a wedding, and I noticed that a couple of the college students working at the Starbucks were speaking Polish. When I asked, they said, yeah, they were from Poland, here for the summer, on a special visa program called the J-1 program, where they live in the United States and work for three months at the rest stop and then get to travel for a month in America before flying home.</p><p begin="00:07:35.59" data-timestamp="455.59">And it seemed like such a crazy thing to fly all the way to America and then be stuck behind a counter in the middle of nowhere for the summer. I wondered if they felt cheated. I wanted to come back and find out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:07:48.63" data-timestamp="468.63"> I'm Sandy, and I'm from Taiwan. And I work at Starbucks in Plattekill Travel Plaza.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:54.75" data-timestamp="474.75"> There are no Polish students this summer. It's mostly Taiwanese and Ukrainians working in Plattekill. Sandy's name back home is Moche Cho. She's a college junior and English major. This is her second year doing this summer work program. Last year, she was one of hundreds of foreign students who got jobs at Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio.</p><p begin="00:08:11.95" data-timestamp="491.95">But this year, she wanted to see a different part of the country and signed up for this location because of two magic words-- New York.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:08:18.43" data-timestamp="498.43"> I love New York. Last year, I went to New York City just three days. So this time, I want to stay in New York City more.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:27.24" data-timestamp="507.24"> And then when you got here, were you surprised how far it was from New York City?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:08:32.01" data-timestamp="512.01"> Yes, very surprised. Yeah. So actually, I'm a little regret about I choose this place, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:40.50" data-timestamp="520.5"> She knew the rest stop wasn't in New York City. She just thought it would be a little closer and easier to get to. Without a car, everything's a hassle. So she hasn't seen New York at all this summer. The only place she's gone is some outlet stores. When she's not at work, she hangs around the apartment with five other students, all women who came over from Asia this summer to work at the rest stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:00.27" data-timestamp="540.27"> When we have day off, we will go to a supermarket to buy grocery. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:06.20" data-timestamp="546.2"> That's it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:07.80" data-timestamp="547.8"> Maybe go to a restaurant to eat something.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:13.02" data-timestamp="553.02"> What's the best thing that's happened this summer on your trip?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:15.98" data-timestamp="555.98"> This summer? So far, I didn't make happiness in this trip. So far, no.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:28.23" data-timestamp="568.23"> Wait, you haven't had much that's been so good this trip?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:31.59" data-timestamp="571.59"> No, so far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:33.63" data-timestamp="573.63"> So this seemed, frankly, a little sad. A bunch of students quietly tolerating their summers, counting the days until they could finally travel the country. Cooking food they don't eat, like hamburgers, and drinks they'd never heard of before arriving here, like frappucinos, all for people who have cars at a place that's all about cars on the side of the highway, but without cars of their own. I felt bad for them.</p><p begin="00:09:56.38" data-timestamp="596.38">And then I started talking to the Ukrainian students.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:59.87" data-timestamp="599.87"> And how's it going?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Evgenia Trekasa</h4><p begin="00:10:01.47" data-timestamp="601.47"> Very good. I think that I really get a very big, huge experience here because I like this place, and I want to come back here. It's really true. I'm happy that I'm here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:18.17" data-timestamp="618.17"> Evgenia Trekasa goes by the name Jane or Angelina here in the States. She's 18, entering her junior year of college. It's her first time away so long from her parents, and she misses them terribly, but it's also very exciting. She says that in the first week or two in Plattekill, she and the other Ukrainians felt stranded, same as the girls from Taiwan and Hong Kong felt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Evgenia Trekasa</h4><p begin="00:10:36.87" data-timestamp="636.87"> Because that we don't have a car, we can't drive. We just can take a bus, so that's why. But then we find friends that, like, when we have a day off, they always can take us. Like, all the guys, it's OK. We will show you beautiful places. So when we have a day off, we always go to somewhere. We never stay at home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:59.67" data-timestamp="659.67"> What happened is that the Ukrainians befriended a couple of the American teenagers who work at the rest stop, and those teenagers introduced them to other young people. And before they knew it, they had rides to the mall, to Six Flags Amusement Park, to New York City.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:11:11.77" data-timestamp="671.77"> My name is Adelaide Giron. I'm 19. I work at Roy Rogers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:15.60" data-timestamp="675.6"> Adelaide is a big, cheerful, fun-loving guy and probably the American who's gotten closest to the Ukrainians. In two years working at the Roy Rogers at the rest stop, he's seen lots of foreign students come through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:11:25.02" data-timestamp="685.02"> I think this group has definitely, by far, been my favorite.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:27.27" data-timestamp="687.27"> Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:11:29.73" data-timestamp="689.73"> I felt like the other groups before, I've gotten attached to them. But this group, I think it's since I'm in college and they're in college. And we drink, and I drink, and they drink. And it's a fun experience.</p><p begin="00:11:40.93" data-timestamp="700.93">I just recently got my license about two years ago-- actually, a year and a half ago. Before that, I was driving illegally, so I really couldn't drive all over the place. But now that I got my license, so, like, [BLEEP] I'm driving everywhere.</p><p begin="00:11:51.48" data-timestamp="711.48">So I hang out with them. I take them shopping. At night, we go, like, swimming at this lake, trespassing. Who cares, though? Just having a good time. We're young. The cops showed up one time. We had alcohol on us. It was a pretty bad story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:06.18" data-timestamp="726.18"> For a while, he says he was going over to their apartment three times a week-- Fridays, Saturdays, and Wednesdays for parties-- parties he taught them how to throw. Here's one of his students in this matter, Peter Molov, one of the Ukrainians.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:19.92" data-timestamp="739.92"> What's your favorite thing that you've done so far since you've been here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Molov</h4><p begin="00:12:23.56" data-timestamp="743.56"> Favorite thing? Probably the parties. Parties. They're a lot different than in our country. If we want to have parties, we just go to the club in our country, in Ukraine. Go to the club, loud music and stuff, you know.</p><p begin="00:12:37.68" data-timestamp="757.68">But since we came here, we get to know other Americans, and they said, let's have a party. Well, OK, let's go to the club. Why to the club? Let's do it at home. OK. We go to home. They showed us games they play.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:12:53.07" data-timestamp="773.07"> Beer pong. Introduced them to my beer funnel-- they'd never seen that before. We showed them flip cup. We showed them how to play flip cup, and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:00.75" data-timestamp="780.75"> I don't even know what that is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:13:01.98" data-timestamp="781.98"> Really? It's a good buzz-getter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Molov</h4><p begin="00:13:06.30" data-timestamp="786.3"> It is fun. A lot of people play, so it's really fun.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:09.72" data-timestamp="789.72"> And you didn't have beer pong back in Ukraine?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Molov</h4><p begin="00:13:12.34" data-timestamp="792.34"> No. I never knew.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:15.32" data-timestamp="795.32"> Will you be taking that back to show your friends back home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter Molov</h4><p begin="00:13:17.85" data-timestamp="797.85"> Oh, yeah. We even want to buy a beer pong table, you know? Special for it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:23.27" data-timestamp="803.27"> I'm not sure they call it a beer pong table.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:13:26.52" data-timestamp="806.52"> They're pretty good for not knowing what beer pong is. Like, we just introduced them to beer pong two months ago, and yet, they're better than me. So yeah, we actually have, like, tournaments going on sometimes, and the Ukrainians end up on top most of the time. So yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:13:41.40" data-timestamp="821.4"> It's impossible to drink so much as Americans do. Americans really drink very much.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:47.07" data-timestamp="827.07"> This is Dasha, another 19-year-old from Ukraine. She said most of the parties here in America in their apartment or out by the lake went until dawn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:13:54.78" data-timestamp="834.78"> At 6:00 AM, 7:00 AM. And then the most fun is then when you work from 9:00 AM and you don't sleep at all. Like, one day, I just slept 30 minutes. I woke up and went to work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:08.95" data-timestamp="848.95"> That was the most fun?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:14:10.09" data-timestamp="850.09"> Yeah. As for me, I was dying at work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:15.16" data-timestamp="855.16"> Fortunately, she works at a Starbucks. The Plattekill Rest Stop has employed foreign students for nearly a decade. They're hard workers and easier to schedule into shifts than American teenagers, who are always needing time off for family vacations, and sports practice, and other activities. There's a group in the summer and then smaller groups in the winter and spring.</p><p begin="00:14:33.54" data-timestamp="873.54">And the Plattekill Rest Stop is a close knit enough place that people cry when they leave. One of the managers told me how she still emails kids from Brazil and Peru who worked here years ago. At least one marriage has come out of this, between an American worker and a Bulgarian girl.</p><p begin="00:14:47.05" data-timestamp="887.05">Though all the managers of the rest stop agreed that they like the Ukrainians, they're good kids, but the Ukrainians are the rowdiest group with the most issues they have ever had, hands down. Probably because the Ukrainians are the first group that were friends back in their home country. They came to Plattekill for a summer adventure.</p><p begin="00:15:03.88" data-timestamp="903.88">They're having too much fun, one manager told me. Fireworks after 2:00 AM, complaints from neighbors. The police have come out a few times, because of the noise. Robert, the general manager, has no idea where he's going to find them housing if their landlord evicts them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:15:17.65" data-timestamp="917.65"> It's been a little bit of a rough summer with them. They're enjoying it. They're college kids. And I think the thing is they forget that they're not living in the dorms. They live in an apartment complex, where there's families, and kids, and little kids. So they just have to be more respectful at times.</p><p begin="00:15:31.87" data-timestamp="931.87">It's not like we don't want them have a good time. You got to make sure you draw the line someplace and say, OK, maybe 1 o'clock is late enough. Or the people are going to work because it's a Tuesday, and you just got to kind of be good neighbors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:45.79" data-timestamp="945.79"> As it turned out, everything came to a head the night before we arrived to record with an all-night party that Adelaide says was their craziest ever-- a party that was not thrown by the Ukrainians. It was the very first party thrown by the girls from Taiwan, total turnaround for them. Adelaide says before this, he and the Ukrainians had only invited them to one party.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:16:05.83" data-timestamp="965.83"> And they really don't drink, so they got drunk off a couple of beers. And we just-- they couldn't hang, so we just didn't invite them anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:13.54" data-timestamp="973.54"> But now they threw this party, a goodbye party for one of the girls who was leaving early, and they partied with the best of them, everybody dancing and making noise. After the second beer run, there was a late night beer fight with people pouring their drinks on each other. As usual, all this bothering the neighbors.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:29.33" data-timestamp="989.33"> Then what was it, they complained to the landlord?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:16:30.88" data-timestamp="990.88"> Yeah. The landlord doesn't like me or my other friends hanging around there. He actually refers to me as a big crazy Mexican that walks around, but. So I don't know. I don't think I'm a big crazy Mexican at all. I'm a gentle giant, really.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:46.08" data-timestamp="1006.08"> And so then Robert had a talk with everybody?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:16:48.05" data-timestamp="1008.05"> Yeah. He had a talk with everybody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:16:49.84" data-timestamp="1009.84"> And it was kind of time to play the heavy-handed dad and just to make sure that they get the full message that this can't go on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:16:57.76" data-timestamp="1017.76"> That we shouldn't have any more parties here. We should be quiet because if there will be one more party, they will send us home. They will, like, break our contract with Plaza, and then there will be no more students in Plaza the next year.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:13.90" data-timestamp="1033.9"> And what do you think of that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:17:16.71" data-timestamp="1036.71"> I don't know. Just, I don't really care they will have any other students next summer. Because I won't be there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:26.45" data-timestamp="1046.45"> The American kids also got a warning from their boss. Again, here's Adelaide.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:17:30.23" data-timestamp="1050.23"> You know, just to stop going over there. The landlord doesn't want me on his property. He sees me or my car, it's getting towed at my expense. I'm going to get charged for trespassing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:41.48" data-timestamp="1061.48"> And so what are you going to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:17:43.76" data-timestamp="1063.76"> Well, I'll probably still go over. [BLEEP] it. There's really nothing-- I mean, if they say anything, I'll just be like, oh, OK. It won't happen again, officer. And of course it'll happen again, but.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:57.94" data-timestamp="1077.94"> And do you worry that you could get the Ukrainians in trouble in a way that they'd get sent back early?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:18:03.74" data-timestamp="1083.74"> I hope not, but if they do, it's all a good time.

There's nothing we can do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:13.48" data-timestamp="1093.48"> And that, everybody says, was the last big party of the year. But no matter. It was still a great summer. I asked Evgenia if she ever felt jealous of all the travelers she saw pass through the rest stop, people on the way to vacations while she was stuck working. And she said never. She'd come so far to get here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Evgenia Trekasa</h4><p begin="00:18:31.82" data-timestamp="1111.82"> They should be jealous of me, because I'm here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:18:52.21" data-timestamp="1132.21"> Inside the rest stop, right when you enter the lobby, between the bathroom and the food court, is this room full of racks of brochures.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:59.17" data-timestamp="1139.17"> Lisa Pollak is one of the gang of nine reporters that we had at Plattekill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:19:02.98" data-timestamp="1142.98"> You know those brochures you'll see in the lobby of a discount hotel, the ones advertising local attractions that inevitably, no matter where in the country you are, include a water park and an underground cavern tour?

Another woman, this mom named Elizabeth McMann, was driving from DC to Albany with her 9-year-old. It's a long drive.

This is where speed becomes crucial. Robert says that if people walk into the rest stop and see a line, if the line doesn't seem like it's moving, they'll walk out without buying. So his staff has to pour it on during the rush if they're going to make their goals and, of course, beat Maine.

Not a bench in a beautiful park, a bench looking out on a highway and a parking lot. Of course they don't care. In fact, they seem not to have noticed at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina</h4><p begin="00:46:44.19" data-timestamp="2804.19"> We're going to Montreal, Canada.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:46:46.82" data-timestamp="2806.82"> You're going to Montreal?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina</h4><p begin="00:46:47.62" data-timestamp="2807.62"> Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johnny</h4><p begin="00:46:48.03" data-timestamp="2808.03"> Yeah, we're coming from New York, and we're going to Montreal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katarina</h4><p begin="00:46:49.85" data-timestamp="2809.85"> Right, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:46:51.09" data-timestamp="2811.09"> Johnny is finishing up his residency, but he's not sure he even wants to be a doctor. 35 years old with more than $200,000 in school debt. But he doesn't want to talk about that. He's on a road trip with his girl. He brushes off my questions, leans into the microphone, and steers us back to what we should be talking about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Johnny</h4><p begin="00:47:10.06" data-timestamp="2830.06"> (SINGING) Love me tender, love me true, never let me go. Oh my god.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:47:24.22" data-timestamp="2844.22"> But even at a rest stop that's fizzy with love, there is heartache. As I'm standing outside, a man asks what I'm doing. So I ask what he's doing. We end up talking for a while. His name is Dan. He's driving back to upstate New York after a day in New York City.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:47:41.79" data-timestamp="2861.79"> Spent some time with my boys.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:47:44.26" data-timestamp="2864.26"> How old are they?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:47:45.22" data-timestamp="2865.22"> 19 and 20-- oh my god-- 23.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:47:48.82" data-timestamp="2868.82"> How often do you see them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:47:50.83" data-timestamp="2870.83"> Not often enough. I'm trying to make it more regular 'cause I just got divorced, like, a year or so ago, and so. They're staying with their mom, so I'm seeing less of them. Try to get to see them, like, once a month.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:02.06" data-timestamp="2882.06"> How is the divorce for them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:48:04.92" data-timestamp="2884.92"> I don't really know. It seems to be OK for them, you know? It's a little weird still, but we still try to do things together and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:14.20" data-timestamp="2894.2"> You and your ex-wife and the kids?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:48:15.42" data-timestamp="2895.42"> No, I don't do things with her anymore. Last year, my son's 18th birthday, we went skydiving together.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:21.88" data-timestamp="2901.88"> All four of you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:48:22.54" data-timestamp="2902.54"> Yeah, all four of us. Like, she wanted her boyfriend to come. And I was like-- I actually called him and said, don't come.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:29.69" data-timestamp="2909.69"> You called him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:48:30.40" data-timestamp="2910.4"> Yeah. I called him, left him a message. It was a very polite message. And I was like, Michael, please don't come.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:48:35.26" data-timestamp="2915.26"> You know him. You have his number.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:48:36.67" data-timestamp="2916.67"> Yeah. I knew him, yeah. So. It was a tough thing. She wanted him to come and, like, go on my son's 18th birthday. And it was like, really, it was just too weird. It's a very weird thing, trying to be friends with your ex, and then you can't really be friends. And then you have this other girlfriend, and then it's just like it's such a difficult thing.</p><p begin="00:48:59.96" data-timestamp="2939.96">She didn't want me to go to the house to pick the boys up. And then one week, we're having a good conversation, and next week, something like that comes up. And you're like-- you have the thing. You want to call that person, and yell at them, and talk to them about it. But you don't have that relationship anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:49:17.51" data-timestamp="2957.51"> That's a hard moment, when you realize, right, we don't have that relationship anymore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:49:24.17" data-timestamp="2964.17"> Try to go to counseling and stuff and try to get her to come back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:49:27.92" data-timestamp="2967.92"> She didn't want to go to counseling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:49:30.35" data-timestamp="2970.35"> She went with me one time, but then she wouldn't stop seeing this guy, this other guy she was seeing. So I mean, that kind of-- I made her pay the copay and we left.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:49:42.71" data-timestamp="2982.71"> This other guy, Michael.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:49:43.76" data-timestamp="2983.76"> Yeah. I had actually met him. I had met him at a party and her and him had become friends. And they just became more and more intimate. And instead of trying to work stuff out with me, she was trying to work stuff out with him, so-- I just think about it a lot. I beat myself up for where did I go wrong as a father, as a husband or whatever. And I'm basically 45 years old, and I figure half my life is over. And I'm really trying to figure out what to do with the next half.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:50:21.29" data-timestamp="3021.29"> I know this is just a rest stop, but really, some kind of love force field is in effect here tonight. Because guess what? Dan has a new girlfriend. She's at the rest stop with him, just doesn't want to talk into a microphone. They met through a singles group, and they've been together long enough that they've started meeting each other's kids. It's still complicated, but wow, it feels great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:50:43.49" data-timestamp="3043.49"> I just told her tonight. I said I don't know what I would do with somebody else in my life. I mean, this is-- I found a woman that really loves me. And I'm, like, so over bowled by that, you know? It's just, it's--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:50:54.37" data-timestamp="3054.37"> It's like a miracle.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan</h4><p begin="00:50:55.19" data-timestamp="3055.19"> Yeah, it is. I'm optimistic about the future. Very optimistic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:08.94" data-timestamp="3068.94"> In the parking lot, when I first saw Stevie G from a distance, I thought he was naked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:51:14.14" data-timestamp="3074.14"> And right now, I'm de-kinking the muscles in my buttock.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:18.12" data-timestamp="3078.12"> Then he kicked one leg in the air above his head, and I saw he was wearing little white gym shoes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:51:23.58" data-timestamp="3083.58"> Oh, it opens up the Fountain of Youth in the front of the hip joint.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:27.18" data-timestamp="3087.18"> And then he jumped into a pool of light, and I saw he actually had on some tiny black nylon shorts. Stevie G teaches bodywork, pilates, yoga, massage, and such. And he stopped at this rest stop to stretch and move. It's hard not to notice, though, that while Stevie is working out in the parking lot, he's simultaneously smoking a hand-rolled cigarette.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:51:51.30" data-timestamp="3111.3"> That's what I am, you know? Unfortunately, I'm polluting my lungs, but they're doing well. I clean them out on a daily basis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:59.80" data-timestamp="3119.8"> How do you clean them out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:52:02.16" data-timestamp="3122.16"> Usually a mixture of running, and steaming, and meditational breathing, and not swallowing what I cough up. I always spit it out. Like, I have a little cup. I can spit out all-- I don't never swallow it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:52:17.04" data-timestamp="3137.04"> Our conversation, by the way, is happening next to Stevie's vehicle, which figures largely in his life. It's an old yellow school bus he got up in Woodstock to start a volunteer service program.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:52:28.86" data-timestamp="3148.86"> Picking up the drunk people, like, going into the bars and finding the ones and say, all right, who looks really bombed? Offer them a free ride home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:52:38.89" data-timestamp="3158.89"> But now Stevie G has a larger vision for the bus. He wants to build a health center made of school buses. Before he leaves the rest stop, Stevie G gets out a big foam roller and takes it to his favorite spot for a final stretch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:52:55.89" data-timestamp="3175.89"> All right, we got all the big 18 wheeler trucks on one side. We've got all the smaller cars over here on the other. We are on 87 highway. This is where I think it's the cleanest. You just got to watch out to see if the dogs have been here.</p><p begin="00:53:10.56" data-timestamp="3190.56">Abracadabra, scoop that belly, burn the jelly, America. You gotta get off your fat one and do something good, something good like the solid oak wood. Get out there and help others. And especially help yourself to be your best, so that you are not a cranky old fool. Now we all got to pull up the hill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:53:34.08" data-timestamp="3214.08"> Stevie rolls all around the sidewalk, with truckers looking down at him from their cabs. He doesn't notice. When he's all loosened up, he picks up his roller and heads back to his vehicle.</p><p begin="00:53:45.18" data-timestamp="3225.18">[ENGINE STARTING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G</h4><p begin="00:53:48.06" data-timestamp="3228.06"> Oh, it sounds good. That's my baby. Take care. Take it easy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:53:56.89" data-timestamp="3236.89"> Stevie G coughs up some phlegm, spits it out, and heads off for Woodstock.</p><p begin="00:54:12.90" data-timestamp="3252.9">It's morning. English sparrows are congregating like crazy in the trees just outside the rest stop doors. Standing out in the parking lot, nine-year-old Brian Belco looks kind of like a bird, actually. His eyes are bright. His arms are stiff at his sides and held out a bit like wings. And when he speaks into the microphone, he bobs his head forward, like he's pecking at it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:54:35.77" data-timestamp="3275.77"> We're going fishing up in Swanton's Mine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:38.61" data-timestamp="3278.61"> Yeah, what are you going to catch?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:54:40.42" data-timestamp="3280.42"> Bass, pike, pickerel, perch.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:44.31" data-timestamp="3284.31"> Wow, it sounds like you've done this before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:54:46.47" data-timestamp="3286.47"> Yep. But the tradition started with my family. It started with my great grandfather.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:52.71" data-timestamp="3292.71"> Is that right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:54:53.88" data-timestamp="3293.88"> My great grandfather was a great fisherman. He really liked fishing, so he went up to Lake Champlain. And some of the cabins were built right over the historic battlefield of the war in 1842, the Battle of Lake Champlain.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:14.37" data-timestamp="3314.37"> You're a student.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:55:16.04" data-timestamp="3316.04"> This is my first radio interview ever.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:18.93" data-timestamp="3318.93"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:55:19.44" data-timestamp="3319.44"> Yep.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:20.10" data-timestamp="3320.1"> You did great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Belco</h4><p begin="00:55:21.25" data-timestamp="3321.25"> I know.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:30.16" data-timestamp="3330.16"> And with the new day here, we have just the time for one final note before we go. Final tallies from the battle between the rest stops in Plattekill and Maine. At the end of the afternoon, after our two days in Plattekill, I can report to you that business never really picked up for either rest stop. And after two days on Saturday afternoon, Robert told me he only had one consolation for the weekend-- he beat Andy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodill</h4><p begin="00:55:53.18" data-timestamp="3353.18"> I'm the king for the day. I beat Andy, and the Red Sox got smacked around and massacred by the Yankees. The unfortunate thing is being king for the day when you miss your sales by seven grand isn't so good. And everybody was down. So it was a bad day for everybody. Maine-- Andy sent out a quick note, not hitting his numbers at all.</p><p begin="00:56:12.39" data-timestamp="3372.39">But you know, we're ready for next weekend. We still got two more weekends to go. I still think they're coming. I mean, yeah, in this business, you've got to be positive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:23.34" data-timestamp="3383.34"> When I left, he was around $12,000 down for two days, 7% or 8% lower than where he needed to be. But all this rain, he said, could make for really beautiful leaves upstate come the fall. A lot of people could get on the roads for that to look at those leaves. He could still turn this around.</p><p begin="00:56:50.41" data-timestamp="3410.41">Today's show was reported in 2009. In the years since, Robert, the general manager, has been promoted several times. He's now a senior director of Motorways, overseeing travel plazas in the New York Thruway, the main turnpike, and a few Starbucks in Massachusetts-- which means, of course, that the competition between Plattekill and Andy in Kennebunkport came to an end. Though, Robert says, they do still argue about baseball.</p><p begin="00:57:13.25" data-timestamp="3433.25">You can still find Lenny Wheat dispensing travel advice and Clara Dragon behind the register at Plattekill, though they've stopped using J-1 visas to bring in foreign students.</p><p begin="00:57:26.68" data-timestamp="3446.68">Well, our program was produced today by Sean Cole and myself, with Alex Blumberg, Jane Marie, Sarah Koenig, Lisa Pollak, Alyssa Shipp, and Nancy Updike. Our senior producer for today's show is Julie Snyder. Additional production on today's rerun from Jessica Lussenhop, Katherine Rae Mondo, Stowe Nelson, and Matt Tierney.</p><p begin="00:57:41.49" data-timestamp="3461.49">Special thanks today to Morgan Hook, from former New York Governor David Patterson's office, to the New York State Thruway Authority, and to Shelia McGee at HMS Host.

Do not believe what people say about him. It's not true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide Giron</h4><p begin="00:58:06.26" data-timestamp="3486.26"> I don't think I'm a big crazy Mexican at all.
