<h3>Act One: When You Talk Music</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.07" data-timestamp="0.07"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. And each week on our show we choose a theme, invite writers and performers of all kinds to do stories on that theme. And, usually, somewhere near the top of the show, I tell you what the theme is and give you a little road map of what's coming up in the hour. But I think that today, it's going to be more interesting if we just start right in on the first act and let things unfold for a while before I give it a name, before I tell you what the theme is.</p></div> </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act Two: A Brother Who Struggles To Be A Star</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:27.43" data-timestamp="27.43"> So our first story is by Dael Orlandersmith. It's originally from her Obie-award winning show, <i>Beauty's</i> <i>Daughters,</i> and was recorded at a variety show here in Chicago, called Millie's Orchid Show.</p><p begin="00:00:38.30" data-timestamp="38.3">Before we begin this story, two quick caveats. Number one, some of the language might not be suitable for younger listeners. Though, as you'll hear, we've beeped out the nastiest words. And, number two-- and usually I would never point something like this out-- you need to know that Dael is a woman, an African-American woman. And I point this out because, If I didn't, you wouldn't be able to enjoy what the audience in the theater with her gets to enjoy, which is the pleasure of watching her complete transformation into this loudmouthed, white guy. So here's Dael Orlandersmith.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:01:10.00" data-timestamp="70"> Hey! Ah! Jerry! How you doin', buddy? How you doin'? Lorraine, you lookin' good honey. You lookin' so fine. Lenny! How's it going? All right.</p><p begin="00:01:26.47" data-timestamp="86.47">Johnny Black, nectar of the gods. Oh, man. I tell you, Len, today was [BLEEP]. Yeah, yeah. I know every day is [BLEEP]. But today was really [BLEEP], you know? So [BLEEP] busy.</p><p begin="00:01:40.33" data-timestamp="100.33">See, everybody I know who works in the fish market-- because my clothes are gettin' [BLEEP] ruined here-- everybody I know who works in the fish market, their clothes are [BLEEP] up.</p><p begin="00:01:51.52" data-timestamp="111.52">And I tell you, Len, I can't stand the thought of goin' home right now. I just can't. Theresa's gettin' fatter and fatter. It ain't 'cause she's pregnant because I don't touch this bitch.</p><p begin="00:02:00.66" data-timestamp="120.66">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:02:01.08" data-timestamp="121.08"> Well, what? What? I'm cold for saying that? Why am I cold? Lenny, let me explain something. No, please wait. No, please, please listen to me. Lenny, I'm 31 years old. I'm married 12 years. I got seven kids. I'm a young man. I'm [BLEEP] trapped. And TT's the laziest bitch in the world. No, no, hear me out. Here she is, 28 years old, looking 50. The problem is? The problem is I married too quick.</p><p begin="00:02:26.65" data-timestamp="146.65">My cousin, Jimmy, says to me, he says, "Anthony, don't get married so quick. You's two are young. Go out and get laid. Have a pisser." But, of course, I don't listen, right? I don't listen. So this is what I am today.</p><p begin="00:02:41.26" data-timestamp="161.26">Come here. I wanna tell you something. Come here. I wanna tell you something. Come here [BLEEP]. Don't [BLEEP] with me. Come over here. Come over here.</p><p begin="00:02:46.53" data-timestamp="166.53">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:02:48.24" data-timestamp="168.24"> I met this chick at my friend Manno's wedding. Yeah, it's a black chick. Yeah, right. Anthony Mancuso. Right. Same [BLEEP] guy from Red Hook. Right. Same guy. Right. He's been in here with me a few times. Right. He lives on 36th Avenue now, in Bensonhurst. Right. It's the same guy. Yeah. Yeah! It's the same [BLEEP] guy. Yeah, it's the same guy.</p><p begin="00:03:11.37" data-timestamp="191.37">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:03:11.85" data-timestamp="191.85"> So, anyway, you know, we're at the reception, right? And TT's talking to Manno's wife, Gail, with the rest of the Cusonettes, right? They're sitting there. They're talkin', "Nah, nah, nah, nah nah." And Manno's wife, Gail, is no prize either, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. So anyway, this black chick-- Diane, her name is, right-- is sittin' over to the side, right?</p><p begin="00:03:35.60" data-timestamp="215.6">So I look over at her, smile. She smiles back. Then I notice that she's big, not fat, big. In proportion, the way TT used to be, right? So I go over to her and I say, "You know, I really think you're good-lookin'. And they really need to get rid of words like Nigger and Guinea. Do you know why? Because I wanna put my tongue in your mouth." She gets mad.</p><p begin="00:04:11.75" data-timestamp="251.75">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:04:13.62" data-timestamp="253.62"> She says, "Let me tell you something. The only reason why you came over here is because I'm the only black person at this wedding. Well, guess what? I don't have a problem with that. You do. So do yourself a favor. Get out of my face before I hurt you."</p><p begin="00:04:29.58" data-timestamp="269.58">Now I'm standing there [BLEEP] slammed, right? So I say, "Listen. Listen. Come here. Listen. I don't care how big you are. Woman or not, you hit me, you're dead," right? Then she says, "First of all, my being a woman is not the issue because I'm more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever know."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Audience</h4><p begin="00:04:53.35" data-timestamp="293.35"> [WHOOPS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:04:53.71" data-timestamp="293.71"> "Second of all, technically, I know I can't whip you because you're still a man. But, if you lay one finger on me, I'll give you such a fight you'll wish to God you stayed home today. In other words, my name is pain. I will inflict. Now, do you really wanna [BLEEP] with me?"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Audience</h4><p begin="00:05:10.31" data-timestamp="310.31"> [WHOOPS]</p><p begin="00:05:11.27" data-timestamp="311.27">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:05:16.07" data-timestamp="316.07"> So now, you know, like, I'm quiet, right? And I'm also scared outta my mind. Now, part of me wants to give her a smack, and another part of me's in love, Lenny, she's so [BLEEP] tough, right? So I say, "Rocky! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, Rocky. I'm sorry, baby. I apologize. Come with me to the bar to get a drink," right?</p><p begin="00:05:40.69" data-timestamp="340.69">So we go to the bar. We go to the bar, right? So I say, "Diane, let me order you a rum and Coke, because I know that blacks and Ricas like that, right?" She gets mad again, right? And she says, "Order me Stoli, rocks, lime garnish, and stop being an asshole." So now I know I'm in love, right? Right.</p><p begin="00:06:03.66" data-timestamp="363.66">So we go to the bar. We're hangin' out. We're talkin', "Yadda, yadda yadda." And the DJ starts playing. I give you one [BLEEP] guess, man. One guess. There you go, baby, Sinatra, Jerry Vale. I swear on my mother, every Guinea wedding, Sinatra, Jerry Vale, right? So then, since all of us are in our '30s, the DJ started playing disco because that's what we danced to when we were kids, and [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</p><p begin="00:06:25.84" data-timestamp="385.84">And I asked Diane would she like to dance. And she says, "No." She hates disco, likes rock, old R&amp;B and jazz. I said, "Oh, my God." I said, "What? You like jazz?" So she said, "Yeah." Lenny, I swear on my [BLEEP] mother, for the next three hours we're talkin' jazz.</p><p begin="00:06:51.65" data-timestamp="411.65">You see, I don't know whether you know this, but I was a major jazz fan, man. I used play. I used to play horn. I was playing both sax and trumpet. And my [BLEEP] record collection, man, I had Cannonball Adderley. I had Miles and Prez, you know? See, jazz, at that time, man, was like so a part of me, you know? But I can't touch it any more. You know what I'm saying?</p><p begin="00:07:23.50" data-timestamp="443.5">So Diane is a poet, you know? And I never knew a poet before. And she was talkin' about, maybe, that I could pick up my horn again, and maybe she could write lyrics. And God, I swear to God, Lenny. This woman is so [BLEEP] beautiful to me now, right? And I'm thinking well, yeah. Maybe, yeah, you know? I could pick up the horn again. You know? And she's just talkin' and talkin'. And I swear she's the most beautiful thing I ever seen, right?</p><p begin="00:07:49.99" data-timestamp="469.99">And she tells me, she says-- I'm gonna sound [BLEEP] queer saying this to you, all right-- but she says, "Anthony, when you talk about music, your face becomes beautiful." Yeah, she said that to me, Lenny. She also called me a pain in the ass. But she said, when I talk music, I become beautiful.</p><p begin="00:08:15.82" data-timestamp="495.82">So, Lenny, all of a sudden-- wait a minute. Wait. I don't want nobody to hear this, right? All of a sudden, Lenny, sittin' there, talking about all these people that I liked in jazz, I felt like crying because I'm not going to be able to touch it again. And nobody ever saw that in me before, you know? Nobody.</p><p begin="00:08:42.42" data-timestamp="522.42">So, anyway, we're talking. And she's really hot, you know? And I wanted to get outside because I was dying to ask for her phone number, right? Seconds later, TT walks out with the kids. "Anthony, me and the kids are ready to go home. Now!" Diane looks at me like I'm [BLEEP] crazy, right? TT's standin' there looking like a [BLEEP] whale. What the [BLEEP] can I do? Bada bing. Bada bang. I introduce them to each other. Diane says, "Pleased to meet you. I'm outta here. I'm doing the slide."</p><p begin="00:09:23.40" data-timestamp="563.4">That night, I take TT home, right? And dig this. Dig this.

I know there's so many of you who are. Act Two is a story about somebody who decided to follow his dream, about being a musician. And, you know, usually, when you hear stories about somebody chasing a dream like this, stories about rock stars or Olympic athletes, or writers, or painters, or basically anybody who had to get out there and follow that star, follow that dream, we don't hear how crushingly hard it is for the overwhelming majority of them. And in the middle of the story, usually, you don't wonder is this worth it?</p><p begin="00:13:03.12" data-timestamp="783.12">Well, the story you're about to hear does not have that shortcoming.

And there was a song on there called, "I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know", which is a real bluesy ballad. And I used to sing that over, and over, and over again in this music room. And so I ended up singing it.</p><p begin="00:20:56.34" data-timestamp="1256.34">It was my first real performance, as me, in front of a stage, being the performer, like the Elvis or something. And I can remember having this silky shirt on. And I probably had my ID bracelet hanging. And I opened up my collar a little. And it was quite an experience, as I recall.

And so I was pretty impressed.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:22:29.72" data-timestamp="1349.72"> If it's not clear by now, I idolized my brother. I used to sneak into his room when he wasn't home and look through his things, put on his clothes, smell his cologne. As a matter of fact, I still have a YMCA T-shirt that he used to wear when he was a counselor at Camp Beaver. It's full of holes, almost a rag, but I'd never let it go.</p><p begin="00:22:52.69" data-timestamp="1372.69">And I've always followed his career in music because I was sure, especially after high school, that he was going to make the big-time.

I made the big-time."</p><p begin="00:23:18.82" data-timestamp="1398.82">And he actually said to me that, "I think you're the next Bruce Springsteen."

And, in effect, that I was going to be the next big thing. There were articles written saying that I was going to be the next Kiss, and this, and that. And Warner Brothers, they were going to have cartoons. And even where they were talking about designing some sort of video pinball game, a real total marketing thing.</p><p begin="00:24:26.44" data-timestamp="1466.44">And I was so excited. And we were a couple of weeks away from signing the contract when OPEC had a oil embargo in 1979. The price of plastic went up 400%. And that was the end of my shot right there. It just vanished before my eyes.</p><p begin="00:25:01.67" data-timestamp="1501.67">We ended up getting them to sign us up for a booking contract. And then, one night, they came up to us.

I remember, one day, they both walked up to me with a glass of milk, and they said, "Would you mind wearing an Elvis mask?"</p><p begin="00:25:29.55" data-timestamp="1529.55">To make a long story short, the thing really kind of fell apart. And, at this point, I really got just totally discouraged with the whole scene. And, in fact, I remember just feeling like that what I really had inside me wasn't coming out. And I took this microphone-- I still have it to this day-- and I threw it up against the wall. I don't know. It's all smashed in. I just left and never went back. I left everything I had that was related to music in that room, and just, basically, quit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dan Gediman</h4><p begin="00:26:02.63" data-timestamp="1562.63"> My brother left music completely for many years after this time, around 1984. For a while he dabbled with a little home recording setup trying to write some songs, but his heart wasn't in it. He stopped going out to clubs, lost touch with most of his musician friends, didn't play, didn't perform, just left. Then, in 1991, seven years later, he discovered karaoke.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Gediman</h4><p begin="00:26:29.30" data-timestamp="1589.3"> I was sitting having dinner.

I didn't know anything about karaoke. And it just sounds fantastic. And I'm saying, "Jeez, all these years I've been sitting around trying to wait for the drummer to show up, or the bass player's having a nervous breakdown. And here there's no band, they just have these laser disks. They play the music and you just go up and sing.

Each week on our program we choose a theme and bring you a wide variety of stories, documentaries, radio monologues, reportage, found tapes and found documents, which is what I have right here in front of me. Our theme today, stories about people who you could say this about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dael Orlandersmith</h4><p begin="00:35:37.71" data-timestamp="2137.71"> When you talk about music, your face becomes beautiful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:42.10" data-timestamp="2142.1"> Aha. And, of course, not everybody agrees about this beauty. Some people do not find it touching or inspiring to see people who love music. In fact, there are people who believe that loving music is a crisis of global proportions.</p><p begin="00:36:03.13" data-timestamp="2163.13">And the document I hold in my hands is an advertisement, a call to arms really, from Motorbooty, a zine, a pretty great zine. And it's an advertisement for the First Annual Conference on World Band Population, on stopping the crisis of world band overpopulation, specifically.</p><p begin="00:36:28.80" data-timestamp="2188.8">Says this ad, "According to recent studies, by the year 2001 there will be more people in bands than the global economy can ever hope to support. The US Census Bureau puts the current number of audience members to band members at a ratio of 2:1. The present trends threatened to reverse this relationship, disrupting the delicate balance between performers and normal people. Soon, not only will virtually everyone be in a band, but everyone in a band will be involved in several side projects, creating a glut of virtually indistinguishable groups of guitar-wielding miscreants who, when not performing their so-called music, will be endlessly talking about it to anyone unable to flee."</p><p begin="00:37:13.58" data-timestamp="2233.58">And then the ad explains what's going to happen at the conference. The seminars dealing with the imminent dangers of band overpopulation, Legal Strategies for Achieving Zero Band Population Growth, Private Sector Initiatives for Ending Band Growth, Strategies for Ending Multiple Band Membership.</p><p begin="00:37:33.59" data-timestamp="2253.59">Here's some of the things that they suggest can be done to combat this global crisis, let's see, three-strikes-and-you're-out rules; creating stiff criminal penalties for artists who release more than three full-length albums per career; waiting periods for instrument purchasers to allow for mandatory background checks for prior infractions, and a cooling-off period to discourage thoughtless and impulsive band formation; stiff fines for bands that imitate other bands; civil infractions for air bands, and an all-out ban on cover bands.</p><p begin="00:38:07.72" data-timestamp="2287.72">They also suggest-- let's see-- boycotting labels that refuse to stop signing additional bands as well as cracking down on pointless, local, so-called, indie labels; finally, supporting random band testing by employers, especially in high-risk businesses like coffee shops, copy shops, cafes, bars, and record stores.</p><p begin="00:38:39.19" data-timestamp="2319.19">Well, given the crisis of global band population explosion, perhaps the only honorable course for all of us is to forget about performing and just put that energy into being members of the audience. And what we present next on our program, as Act Three, is a case example of how to do exactly that.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Four: A Life In Music</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:15.52" data-timestamp="2355.52"> This is the Fastbacks, a pop, punk band from Seattle that's been around for years, actually. And the story you're about to hear is not about being in a semi-obscure but well-respected band, it's about being a fan of a semi-obscure but well-respected band. Sarah Vowell is a writer and a music columnist for the <i>San</i> <i>Francisco</i> <i>Weekly</i>, and she tells the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:39:40.53" data-timestamp="2380.53"> Sometimes, opening your mail can be a little like listening to the radio. You're not paying attention, just absent-mindedly flipping through the letters and bills, and then, wham, some little surprise comes out of nowhere and changes your day.</p><p begin="00:39:56.08" data-timestamp="2396.08">I got this package. Inside was a letter, thanking me for mentioning the Fastbacks in a book review I had written, not from one of the Fastbacks themselves, mind you, just some guy in Chicago. His name was Scott Lee, and he'd enclosed this xerox booklet about the band.</p><p begin="00:40:14.68" data-timestamp="2414.68">Flipping through it, I stopped cold at something called, "The Fastback's Drummers Pie Chart". Since they formed in 1979, the Fastbacks have gone through about a dozen drummers. And this pie chart identifies the drummers by name, listing the percentage of songs which each one has contributed to. But, at the bottom of the page, small print warns, "Note, Rusty and Nate's shares may not be totally accurate. Their percentages may be approximately 0.68% off." And I don't think a decimal point had ever struck me as endearing before. The drastic exactitude of 0.68% sort of captured my heart, and I had to meet this person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Lee</h4><p begin="00:40:59.73" data-timestamp="2459.73"> Basically, it has your standard discography. And then there's just some facts here that I dug out, 139 total songs, eight hours, 25 minutes, 43 seconds worth of songs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:41:14.83" data-timestamp="2474.83">So he showed me other stats, like total recorded versions of songs, total number of seconds of songs, which is 30,343, in case you were wondering.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Lee</h4><p begin="00:41:26.53" data-timestamp="2486.53"> --shortest song, shortest instrumental song, shortest song with vocals, the longest song, and the longest song without a drum solo. That's only because--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:41:34.67" data-timestamp="2494.67">I was stunned. I mean, I thought I liked the band. And, normally, as a music lover and as a woman, I rail against the mostly-male, record-collector geek habit of reducing rock and roll to baseball card collecting. They flatten out this complex, thrilling thing down to manageable lists of names and titles and dates.</p><p begin="00:41:56.45" data-timestamp="2516.45">But Scott Lee's Fastbacks tribute has the devotional fervour of a medieval illuminated manuscript. The list of facts and figures is so relentless and exact and painstaking that it takes on this liturgical glow, as if the Fastbacks were a religion and Scott Lee its prophet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Lee</h4><p begin="00:42:15.86" data-timestamp="2535.86"> But some of the new additions to this-- as I ramble here-- listed out the songs A through Z and did the percentages of songs starting with each letter. And the letter that won was I. There were 19 Fastback songs that started with I, representing about 14% of the songs. With every album, they seem to have a song that starts with, "In", like, "In America", "In The Summer", "In The Winter", "In The Observatory".</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:42:46.81" data-timestamp="2566.81"> I soon found out that the band has befriended Scott Lee and that they've sort of informally appointed him their de-facto archivist. Singer Kim Warnick corresponds with Scott via email, sometimes, like four times a day. Guitarist and songwriter, Kurt Bloch, graciously calls him "A good person to have on our team." Though, when he first saw Scott Lee's packet, he had some understandable worries.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Bloch</h4><p begin="00:43:12.82" data-timestamp="2592.82"> Ah! I mean, it was like, boy. The first thing that would come to my mind is, is this guy really scary? Is he the kind of person I would run away from, if he was ever in the same room? Is this the kind of person that I would stop answering my telephone if he called? And, no, it's not. Not to make you think that we don't think Scott Lee is actually fairly crazy of a person, but he's not the annoying kind of crazy person that you read about. And I think he appreciates his own over-the-top-ness.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:43:54.10" data-timestamp="2634.1"> If anything, the Fastbacks are a little protective of Scott Lee. When I was talking to Kurt, I jokingly called Scott his stalker. But he set me straight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Bloch</h4><p begin="00:44:04.57" data-timestamp="2644.57"> No, he's not a stalker. He's a super-fan.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:44:06.66" data-timestamp="2646.66"> Oh, a super-fan?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kurt Bloch</h4><p begin="00:44:07.76" data-timestamp="2647.76"> Yeah. Stalker, that has negative connotations. Yeah, that's something we don't need. Super-fan is fine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:44:15.72" data-timestamp="2655.72"> Like the super-fan, the members of the Fastbacks all have day jobs. So, on any given day, it's possible that Scott is devoting more energy to being a fan than the Fastbacks devote to being in the band. When I interviewed Kim, the gaping differences between being a band member and being a super-fan were never clearer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:44:36.69" data-timestamp="2676.69"> OK, so I have a pop-quiz for you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim Warnick</h4><p begin="00:44:39.94" data-timestamp="2679.94"> OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:44:40.34" data-timestamp="2680.34"> How many total songs, before the new album, <i>New</i> <i>Mansions</i> <i>in</i> <i>Sound</i>, have the Fastbacks recorded?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim Warnick</h4><p begin="00:44:49.11" data-timestamp="2689.11"> What is it, now?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:44:51.11" data-timestamp="2691.11"> How many total songs have the Fastbacks recorded?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim Warnick</h4><p begin="00:44:54.22" data-timestamp="2694.22">Well, you know, unfortunately, I don't have something in front of me that could answer that question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:44:58.19" data-timestamp="2698.19">Really? OK. I have to say it is 127. And I was wondering also if you knew the median song length?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim Warnick</h4><p begin="00:45:06.96" data-timestamp="2706.96"> The what?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:45:08.51" data-timestamp="2708.51"> Well, let's start with an easier one. What do you think is the average length of a Fastbacks song?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:45:14.75" data-timestamp="2714.75"> She doesn't know. But, according to Scott, it's two minutes, 51 seconds.</p><p begin="00:45:28.42" data-timestamp="2728.42">When I visit Scott Lee's house on Chicago's north side, his roommate lets me in. Scott's playing his guitar along with the new Fastbacks album. His room is decorated with Fastbacks posters. And Scott himself wears a Fastbacks T-shirt. He shows me this incredibly complex chart he's working on, a sort of family tree to the Seattle music scene, a town, by the way, which he has only visited once.</p><p begin="00:45:55.56" data-timestamp="2755.56">The producers of <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> would like me to say here that, when Scott talks about the Fastbacks, he becomes beautiful because that would go along with the first piece in the show today. But I would never say something so corny.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:46:22.89" data-timestamp="2782.89"> When do you think you made the switch between just being a listener and being, as Kurt Bloch called you today, a super-fan?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Lee</h4><p begin="00:46:32.01" data-timestamp="2792.01"> I think the transition really happened when I was in law school, and I had made this tape of my favorite Fastbacks songs. And I was walking across a very icy, cold midway in Buffalo. And, despite how cold it was, when I listened to this music, it really just pumped all this life into me. It was really a life-affirming experience, as corny as that might sound. But, I don't know, I was just really happy at that point. And it was just a light on me that shown. And I hadn't seen it before. And now everything seemed better.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:47:10.70" data-timestamp="2830.7"> When you show this info packet to people, what is usually their reaction?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Lee</h4><p begin="00:47:20.20" data-timestamp="2840.2"> I think the first question I always hear is, "Do you have a lot of spare time?"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:47:26.88" data-timestamp="2846.88"> In fact, Scott's spare time is limited. He holds down a full-time job at a Chicago advertising agency, and he writes his own songs. And, truthfully, he flirts with the idea of not staying a fan. He's moving to Seattle, partly to be closer to the Fastbacks. He's actually in their circle of friends now. And he's tried a couple of times to start his own band.</p><p begin="00:47:50.86" data-timestamp="2870.86">Once, he was invited on-stage with Kurt to play along with the song. It was exciting. But he's left-handed. And they didn't have a left-handed guitar for him. So it was sort of a disaster, not the moment a super-fan dreams of.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:48:05.51" data-timestamp="2885.51"> So, in this show, what happens is someone tells their little story and then we play a song. So you get to pick which Fastbacks song gets to play at the end of your story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Lee</h4><p begin="00:48:19.13" data-timestamp="2899.13"> At the end of my story? Whew. [LAUGHS] I'd probably say, "Save Room For Me", then.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:54.33" data-timestamp="2994.33"> Act Four, A Life in Music. Sam Franco's 72 and has spent his life playing and teaching the accordion. And the thing to know about him is he hates accordion music, most of it, anyway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Franco</h4><p begin="00:50:06.07" data-timestamp="3006.07"> The sound of the accordion, we don't associate ourselves with too much, is like this.</p><p begin="00:50:16.10" data-timestamp="3016.1">[ACCORDIAN PLAYING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Franco</h4><p begin="00:50:27.55" data-timestamp="3027.55"> See?

[LAUGHS] It swings with the one finger. And I get a jazz sound, like this. Watch.</p><p begin="00:50:49.53" data-timestamp="3049.53">[ACCORDIAN PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:22.99" data-timestamp="3082.99"> Sam Franco hates that accordion oom-pah beat. He doesn't like the normal Lawrence Welk chord progressions. In his music, he changes them into jazz chord progressions. And, where normal accordion players use lots of chords all over the place, he prefers to play single notes. In his head, when he plays, Sam hears Coleman Hawkins and other jazz greats. He invented this style. And, if you check the Chicago Yellow Pages for jazz accordion, Sam is the only listing.</p><p begin="00:51:47.15" data-timestamp="3107.15">[ACCORDIAN PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:51:53.44" data-timestamp="3113.44"> All this hour we've heard from people who want to make their living, full-time, from their music. They dream and strive for that. Sam's done it all his life, playing gigs, working, never getting famous, though.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Franco</h4><p begin="00:52:06.62" data-timestamp="3126.62">You know what saved me? That I had the knack for teaching. You understand? That was my ace-in-the-hole, would be the teaching part. If I didn't have that, I would be out of the music business completely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:20.53" data-timestamp="3140.53"> He's watched players who weren't any better than him get a lot of attention, get notoriety, get more gigs. And, in the end, he decided he doesn't care. That life doesn't suit him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Franco</h4><p begin="00:52:32.28" data-timestamp="3152.28"> You couldn't pay mortgages, buy a house, on playing because you played one night. That's it. How would you like to go look for a job every week? And that's what it amounted to. I never did have that kind of energy.</p><p begin="00:52:47.24" data-timestamp="3167.24">[ACCORDIAN PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:57.13" data-timestamp="3177.13"> Most of the people who Sam started playing with back when he was a kid did not stay with music. Back when Sam began, accordion was huge, huge. Every band in Chicago had an accordionist doing their keyboards because pianos, in those days, were so impractical, you know? You can't carry them around. The one that you find at the hall is always out of tune.</p><p begin="00:53:20.47" data-timestamp="3200.47">But that era did not last. When Elvis hit in the late '50s and rock and roll followed, accordion business died. Nobody hired them. Nobody wanted to take lessons. And lots of guys who Sam played and taught with quit the music business.</p><p begin="00:53:34.60" data-timestamp="3214.6">Sam had always played guitar too. And he was actually one of the few people in his crowd who made the jump from the swing era to the rock era. These days, he jokes that every brick of his house was paid for by rock and roll. A big poster of electric guitarist, Randy Rhoads, is the biggest thing in his music room. He taught lessons for years on the guitar. But Sam still views the guitar as an inferior instrument. He can lecture you for a long time on how it's not in the symphony orchestra. Basically, in his view, America's 40-year love affair with the guitar is a concerted effort to slap back at the accordion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sam Franco</h4><p begin="00:54:11.51" data-timestamp="3251.51"> Because everybody's mother and father played the accordion. And they said, we're not going to play it, you know? We're going to play something different. And there it was. It just came out as a rebel cause, I think. It only has five notes, a set of six strings. Two are the same, so it brings it down to five notes, you know? You have to hit it with a pick. You've got to use two hands to make one note. Does that make sense? Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to use two hands to make one note?</p><p begin="00:54:58.23" data-timestamp="3298.23">[ACCORDIAN PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:06.80" data-timestamp="3306.8"> I met Sam through one of his students, Catherine Boyd, who totally adores Sam, has known him for years and says that, whatever goes on in Sam's life, he's always happy when he's talking about music.</p><p begin="00:55:18.02" data-timestamp="3318.02">And the most surprising thing Sam told me when we talked is that it took him a long time before he was completely at peace with the way he plays. He started playing accordion when he was 10. He's 72 now. He played accordions back in the old neighborhood on Taylor Street as a kid.
