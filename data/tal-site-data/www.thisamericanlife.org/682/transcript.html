<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.62" data-timestamp="0.62"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. There's this kind of therapy for trauma, victims of sexual assault, soldiers with PTSD, where instead of taking years and talking, and talking, and talking on some couch to a therapist with no end in sight, you basically knock it out, all the treatment in just 10 or 12 sessions.</p><p begin="00:00:20.75" data-timestamp="20.75">Two weeks-- you can do it in two weeks. And it's effective. Studies have shown that. This therapy's been around since the '80s, but I think lots of people who might find it useful don't even know it's an option for them. Like, for instance, Jaime Lowe, who's a writer and reporter and a good candidate for this treatment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:00:39.37" data-timestamp="39.37"> I was sexually assaulted when I was 13, almost 30 years ago. And for most of those 30 years, I didn't really talk about it. Not because I didn't want to or need to, but because I didn't know how. And no one asked.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:54.77" data-timestamp="54.77"> Jaime Lowe decided to do a story where she would go through this therapy herself and record all of the sessions, which never happens. Like most therapy, usually this treatment is in private, not on the radio.</p><p begin="00:01:08.48" data-timestamp="68.48">And hearing how it works, it really is kind of remarkable. My mom was a therapist. I've been in therapy. This is so different from what I have ever heard. And that's going to be our show today. We're going to hear it step by step, this sometimes life-changing process, and how that can happen so quickly.</p><p begin="00:01:27.56" data-timestamp="87.56">A quick warning to listeners before we start about content. This story does mention the sexual assault of a teenager. Here's Jaime Lowe.</p></div> </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Week One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:01:37.04" data-timestamp="97.04">I thought because I didn't talk about the assault or even think about it much, everything was as resolved as it could be. But then after Donald Trump, and "grab them by the pussy," and Harvey Weinstein, and all of them, it's not that specific memories of the assault would pop up, I just felt immobilized, anxious, protective of my body. And I realized my sexual assault wasn't resolved at all.</p><p begin="00:02:04.01" data-timestamp="124.01">Around this time, I heard about a therapy for sexual assault survivors, called Cognitive Processing Therapy, or CPT. A researcher described it to me as short-term inexpensive, practical, like learning a skill. The typical way to deal with trauma in therapy is to talk about the incident over and over, until it's less radioactive.</p><p begin="00:02:27.99" data-timestamp="147.99">CPT does the same thing, but in a systematized way. It's all laid out in advance, and the same for everyone-- what you'll do in the first session, and the second, and the third, and so on. Each session is based on learning a skill and practicing that skill on a worksheet. You go over each element of the trauma, piece by piece, and try to see it differently. The goal is to change the story you've been telling yourself about what happened.</p><p begin="00:02:57.97" data-timestamp="177.97">I got in touch with Dr. Debra Kaysen, a psychologist with a specialty in trauma therapy at the University of Washington School of Medicine. She and I started talking and e-mailing about CPT. It all seemed so different than the therapy I was used to-- my weekly talk sessions-- and I realized I wanted to try it.</p><p begin="00:03:18.52" data-timestamp="198.52">I've done a lot of therapy. After the assault, I had two manic episodes and was diagnosed bipolar. I've always been very open about mental illness. I wrote a book about being bipolar a couple of years ago. But even though that book is partly about my adolescence, I barely mention the assault. I've never dealt with it, I never wanted to-- in the book, in treatment.</p><p begin="00:03:43.70" data-timestamp="223.7">But now I was feeling the trauma more. I thought CPT might help me. I also thought, what if this could help lots of people? I asked Dr. Kaysen if I could record the sessions and play them on the radio. She checked in with colleagues-- a psychologist with an expertise in journalism, a journalism ethics professor-- to make sure we'd be able to have a therapeutic relationship while I was simultaneously doing a story about the therapy.</p><p begin="00:04:12.52" data-timestamp="252.52">After a lot of back and forth and establishing some basic ground rules, we set up our CPT boot camp-- 10 hour-long sessions over two weeks in Seattle. Usually CPT is one session a week for 12 weeks, but we decided to condense it. And early studies show this approach is effective. Last October, I flew out to Seattle.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:04:35.11" data-timestamp="275.11"> Session one, October 22nd.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:04:38.68" data-timestamp="278.68"> Excellent.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:04:39.32" data-timestamp="279.32"> Yeah. OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:04:40.81" data-timestamp="280.81"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:04:40.96" data-timestamp="280.96"> I'm sitting with Dr. Kaysen in a generic room at the university clinic. I fail at setting up the recording equipment a few times, before getting it semi-right. I'm not a radio person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:04:52.37" data-timestamp="292.37"> So let me tell you a little bit about what we're going to do today. OK?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:04:54.99" data-timestamp="294.99"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:04:55.34" data-timestamp="295.34"> So usually, today is a little more heavy on the psycho ed. It's going to be a little different than a lot of our other sessions. I'm going to be talking a lot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:05:03.88" data-timestamp="303.88"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:05:04.29" data-timestamp="304.29"> OK? Which takes a little bit of the pressure off of you, maybe.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:05:07.31" data-timestamp="307.31"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:05:08.10" data-timestamp="308.1"> Dr. Kaysen has a kindergarten teacher presence that makes me feel ready and OK. She starts the first session with me the way she would with anyone, by talking about sexual assault and PTSD. 50% of women who are sexually assaulted develop PTSD. That could mean symptoms like depression, anxiety, flashbacks-- some of the things I've actually been feeling when I hear the news.</p><p begin="00:05:35.34" data-timestamp="335.34">Dr. Kaysen hands me a photocopied worksheet. Everything we're going to do, this entire therapy, is structured around these worksheets. I'll do them at my Airbnb. And when Dr. Kaysen and I meet, we'll go over them. Each set of worksheets will cover a new skill, and I'll master that before moving on to the next skill, which Dr. Kaysen will introduce at the end of each session.</p><p begin="00:05:58.25" data-timestamp="358.25">The idea is, by the time we're done, I'll be able to do this on my own with any issue in my life. Dr. Kaysen explains my first assignment. Most of the worksheets have all sorts of boxes to fill in with answers. They look like badly designed forms you'd get at the DMV, but this first one is just a sheet of paper.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:06:17.80" data-timestamp="377.8"> What I want you to do is write at least one page on why you think that the sexual assault occurred. I do not want you to use this as an opportunity to write specific details about the event, OK? This is more writing about what you think caused the event.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:06:37.33" data-timestamp="397.33"> The phrase "caused the event" makes me uneasy, because as much as I intellectually believe that nothing specific really caused the event, there are things I still question. It's embarrassing that, after 30 years, I still might think it's my fault, but I do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:06:55.52" data-timestamp="415.52"> I can tell you that the cause is going to be very hard for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:06:58.57" data-timestamp="418.57"> Yeah. Yeah, we talked earlier about what are the stories we tell ourselves.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:02.19" data-timestamp="422.19"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:07:03.38" data-timestamp="423.38"> It was this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:04.60" data-timestamp="424.6"> Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:07:05.49" data-timestamp="425.49"> Right? The event happened because I took a shortcut. Right? The event happened because I had a drink. The event happened because I was wearing a short skirt. And sometimes people know that that's not why it happened, but sometimes those thoughts still haunt them. OK. There aren't any right or wrong answers. I want you to just vomit the ideas on the page.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:28.93" data-timestamp="448.93"> That's my specialty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:07:30.02" data-timestamp="450.02"> Awesome. Then you'll do well.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:30.36" data-timestamp="450.36"> I love vomiting out words.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:07:31.93" data-timestamp="451.93"> That's awesome. That's what I want. All right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:34.84" data-timestamp="454.84"> OK, so.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:07:37.07" data-timestamp="457.07"> OK, any worries that you have about doing this?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:42.96" data-timestamp="462.96"> Nope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:07:44.38" data-timestamp="464.38"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:07:46.28" data-timestamp="466.28"> But of course, I'm worried. The thought of reliving the assault is terrifying. Even reading the one-sentence description of the assault during the audio recording of my book left me in tears.

In the past 24 hours, how much have I been distressed by repeated disturbing and unwanted memories of the traumatic event? Each question gets a numerical value on a scale of 0 to 4, and Dr. Kaysen adds them up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:09:06.59" data-timestamp="546.59"> And so what I'll do is I'll actually start graphing these and keeping track--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:09:12.38" data-timestamp="552.38"> Cool.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:09:12.62" data-timestamp="552.62"> --of them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:09:13.77" data-timestamp="553.77"> I'm not sure how to answer these questions with a number, but I have the same problem when physicians ask me to rate pain on a scale of 1 to 10. After we go over my PTSD symptoms, Dr. Kaysen will ask me about my mood.

I used to pass an alley and wave at a man. He was young, maybe late teens, early 20s. Every morning, I'd wave at him. He would walk up the alley. I would cross the alley. Or some mornings, I would walk down the alley against my mom's instructions. But we'd pass, and I'd always wave or smile, which is how I greeted everyone in the neighborhood.</p><p begin="00:11:14.57" data-timestamp="674.57">It didn't seem like he should be any different. And in some ways, in retrospect, I feel like I overcompensated and was extra friendly and maybe invited him in, that my wave somehow signaled to him that this was something I wanted, that my friendliness was misinterpreted as desire. That I should have avoided him, [SOBBING] rather than interact.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:51.60" data-timestamp="711.6"> I break down, but I keep reading.

So one of the things was a piece around your mom's instructions. Is that-- and I noticed that those emotions got a little more intense when you got to that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:12:55.34" data-timestamp="775.34"> That was something that I didn't actually remember until I was writing it this morning.

She wonders if this might be a stuck point. Stuck points are the first skill introduced in CPT, and they might be the most important skill of all. In a sense, the entire project of CPT is finding stuck points, and then learning how to unstick them.</p><p begin="00:13:28.19" data-timestamp="808.19">A stuck point is basically something you hold to be true, but might in fact not be true. A stuck point is a belief or a thought that's keeping you stuck in the PTSD, stuck in thinking that it's your fault, or that there's something you could have done to avoid it, or stuck in any number of upsetting or inaccurate or harmful ways of remembering what happened. They're so central to this process that Dr. Kaysen hands me a worksheet titled, Stuck Point Log.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:13:57.56" data-timestamp="837.56"> OK. This is going to be a living document that you and I are going to share.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:01.61" data-timestamp="841.61"> We'll keep track of all my stuck points here, adding to the list as we identify new ones each session, and crossing them off as I work through them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:14:10.10" data-timestamp="850.1"> So I may be hearing a little bit of a stuck point, maybe, around like, I should've listened to my mom, or if I hadn't gone that way, it wouldn't have happened.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:23.57" data-timestamp="863.57"> I think it's more like if I hadn't waved, it wouldn't have happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:14:26.74" data-timestamp="866.74"> Perfect.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:27.50" data-timestamp="867.5"> That actually feels more like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:14:29.74" data-timestamp="869.74"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:30.73" data-timestamp="870.73"> --what, um.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:14:32.26" data-timestamp="872.26"> So write that down. We're going to start keeping track of these as we find them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:36.57" data-timestamp="876.57"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:14:36.96" data-timestamp="876.96"> So if I hadn't waved, it wouldn't have happened. OK. All right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:42.92" data-timestamp="882.92"> Dr. Kaysen asked me what feelings are coming up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:14:46.40" data-timestamp="886.4"> I mean, I hear the word shame associated a lot with things like this. And I feel like that would apply, but it doesn't feel like the right word. Like, it feels more just like I want to just shelter myself, and I want to just cocoon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:15:06.15" data-timestamp="906.15"> OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:15:08.62" data-timestamp="908.62"> I think that I also just don't like that word. Like, I think that there's something shameful about shame. It's like-- I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:15:18.23" data-timestamp="918.23"> So I think that's going to be an important one for us to sort out, actually, because feelings aren't good or bad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:15:23.22" data-timestamp="923.22"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:15:23.94" data-timestamp="923.94"> Right?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:15:25.22" data-timestamp="925.22"> Isn't there another word, though?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:15:27.64" data-timestamp="927.64"> I bristle at the word "shame." I always have. There's no room for shame. It sounds weak to me. Like, if you have shame, you have something to feel shameful about. With shame comes softness, and vulnerability, and fragility.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:15:44.45" data-timestamp="944.45"> So you will see these lovely worksheets. These are called ABC sheets. OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:15:50.36" data-timestamp="950.36"> It's the end of the session, and ABC is the new skill. I'm supposed to fill in the A column with the activating event-- in my case, the sexual assault-- B with my belief or stuck point about the event, C with the consequence of that belief or stuck point. It's kind of clunky, but the idea seems to be to get you to see that your stuck points are not rational and that hanging on to these irrational stuck points has real emotional consequences, that continuing to tell yourself this stuff as fact makes you feel bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:16:27.50" data-timestamp="987.5"> Last thoughts, questions? How did this work for you today?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:16:31.89" data-timestamp="991.89"> Um, good. It was intense.

Reliving it?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:17:21.86" data-timestamp="1041.86"> I do feel like I was reliving a little.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:17:27.26" data-timestamp="1047.26"> We finish the checklist and take out the worksheets. I'd done seven the night before. Because I'm doing a crash course in CPT, each session each day covers a week's worth of treatment. It feels like I'm cramming, but Dr. Kaysen tells me she has patients who are still doing worksheets in the waiting room before sessions. That makes me feel a little better.</p><p begin="00:17:51.32" data-timestamp="1071.32">We pick up with the stuck point we started on yesterday. If I hadn't said hi, he wouldn't have assaulted me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:17:58.64" data-timestamp="1078.64"> Had you interacted with this guy beforehand?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:18:01.82" data-timestamp="1081.82"> It had been several weeks, probably, of saying hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:18:05.98" data-timestamp="1085.98"> OK.

The likelihood that that was the cause is very small to none.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:18:29.40" data-timestamp="1109.4"> You were a little girl.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:18:31.10" data-timestamp="1111.1"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:18:32.39" data-timestamp="1112.39"> Right? You were a little girl going to school.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:18:34.63" data-timestamp="1114.63"> Right. But still, I wouldn't have said I was a little girl. Like, I felt like I was someone who was able to operate in the world and have conversations and interactions with adults, and have responsibility.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:18:52.13" data-timestamp="1132.13"> I associate the words "little girl" with a kind of unformed, helpless pink thing covered in ruffles. I didn't relate. At 13, I was babysitting. I had crushes and fantasies. I happily went to the movies or thrifting by myself.</p><p begin="00:19:08.93" data-timestamp="1148.93">We move on to another one of the stuck points, which was covering something I hadn't thought about for a long time-- what I was wearing on the day of the assault. I wore floral boxers from The Gap and a matching solid colored T-shirt. While doing the worksheets this morning, I realized that some part of me still thought the assault was my fault for wearing men's boxers as shorts. And I tell Dr. Kaysen about this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:19:34.56" data-timestamp="1174.56"> I mean, I liked thinking about what I was wearing and trying to wear cute things.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:19:40.76" data-timestamp="1180.76"> She assumes that there was some kind of sexiness attached to the outfit for me, but that wasn't it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:19:47.36" data-timestamp="1187.36"> Or I didn't wear a sexy outfit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:19:50.28" data-timestamp="1190.28"> OK.

And I remember putting it in the giveaway pile months later and being asked why I was giving it away since it looked brand new. By the end of the worksheet, my thinking shifts.

It would all come up-- the details, how I felt, what exactly happened in that moment, and what exactly changed.</p><p begin="00:25:37.85" data-timestamp="1537.85">We're nearing the end of our first week together, and I feel like Dr. Kaysen, on purpose or not, has waited until we both felt comfortable. There was trust, the skills of CPT had been discussed, and then this, this story-- the main reason I was here in this room, in this city. It was time for it to come out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:25:59.59" data-timestamp="1559.59"> And he was kind of in this, like, kind of cove, I guess, behind a bush.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:26:05.93" data-timestamp="1565.93"> We lived in a very middle class area in West Los Angeles. Our apartment was near two big streets, Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Glen. There were office buildings nearby and a big mall with a massive food court.</p><p begin="00:26:20.57" data-timestamp="1580.57">My mom's greatest fear in life was that our landlord would sell the duplex, forcing us to leave. It was a place where I knew most of our neighbors. There were always people hanging out in front of their houses. Our across-the-street-neighbors were mechanics with a pitbull named Bumper. It was a tree-lined, sun-kissed, America dream neighborhood.</p><p begin="00:26:42.86" data-timestamp="1602.86">That morning, I walked past an alley between an office building and an apartment building, and the guy was there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:26:50.37" data-timestamp="1610.37"> And he, like-- like, I smiled or waved, and then he beckoned me over. I didn't know why. And then I walked over.</p><p begin="00:27:03.68" data-timestamp="1623.68">And he held a knife to my side, and then he put his hands down my boxers and felt my vagina. And then I think I said something about, like, protesting. And he said that my father owed him money. And I was like, there's no way that's true.</p><p begin="00:27:33.95" data-timestamp="1653.95">And then he kept saying, let me just kiss it, and put his mouth on my vagina. And then I scream, but it wasn't a scream. It was just kind of a vocal articulation. It wasn't particularly loud. And then he ran up the alley the other way.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:27:59.23" data-timestamp="1679.23"> I wish the word vagina didn't feel so clinical. It was more than that. It was like he found a way into my personal sexuality, like a portal into parts of me I hadn't explored or known, because I was so young.</p><p begin="00:28:14.86" data-timestamp="1694.86">Eighth grade-- before it happened, I would daydream about having a first kiss. And then after it happened, I thought I'd never be able to. Like, I'd never be able to experience romantic interactions or understand them. Sex, sexual bodies, that shit is hard enough for a 13-year-old.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:28:37.36" data-timestamp="1717.36"> And so in that moment where he had a knife up to you, what did you think was going to happen? Do you remember?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:28:45.18" data-timestamp="1725.18"> I have no idea. I didn't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:28:48.54" data-timestamp="1728.54"> Yeah.

I wasn't raped. I wasn't, like, even cut. Like, nothing was physically wrong. Nothing was particularly, like, damaged, I guess, except for psychologically, everything was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:29:28.78" data-timestamp="1768.78"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:29:29.69" data-timestamp="1769.69"> And so it's, in some ways, I think even harder because I felt like it wasn't so bad. Or I was supposed to think it wasn't so bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:29:38.38" data-timestamp="1778.38"> So I'm hearing a stuck point around, I shouldn't be distressed, or this wasn't-- there's almost a little bit of a minimizing kind of stuck point.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:29:48.97" data-timestamp="1788.97"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:29:49.99" data-timestamp="1789.99"> But how would you put it-- what would the belief be around that? The, because I wasn't raped, or because I wasn't cut, I shouldn't have these reactions? I'm not sure exactly what the stuck point is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:30:05.96" data-timestamp="1805.96"> I think because it wasn't worse.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:30:08.87" data-timestamp="1808.87"> Because it wasn't worse, I should be functioning better. I add this to the stuck point log. My experience, by the way, was an outlier in that I was assaulted by a stranger. Sexual assault is usually perpetrated by an acquaintance or family member. Only 7% of juvenile victims who report sexual assault are assaulted by strangers.</p><p begin="00:30:33.24" data-timestamp="1833.24">At the end of the session, Dr. Kaysen introduces the new skill-- patterns of problematic thinking, which include things like mind reading, and emotional reasoning, and exaggerating, or minimizing. I'm put off by the language. It's oddly formal. I came in thinking CPT was supposed to be accessible, but it's hard to get a handle on. They use real English words, but not in the dictionary definition way. The phrases have a separate CPT meaning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:31:07.05" data-timestamp="1867.05"> Do these make sense for the most part for you?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:31:10.80" data-timestamp="1870.8"> Kind of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:31:11.74" data-timestamp="1871.74"> OK.

Today's program, <i>Ten</i> <i>Sessions.</i> What can you do with trauma from long ago that's never healed? If you're just tuning in, writer Jaime Lowe heard about a kind of therapy called CPT, Cognitive Processing Therapy, that helps people deal with unhealed trauma from sexual assault or combat PTSD, incredibly, in just 10 or 12 sessions. And she decided to try it herself. We pick up halfway through the therapy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:35:22.69" data-timestamp="2122.69"> Session six.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:35:24.34" data-timestamp="2124.34"> All right, so in general, since I last saw you on Friday, how has your mood been?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:35:30.91" data-timestamp="2130.91"> It's Monday, and I've self-cared my way through the weekend, which is another way to say that I went to a handful of vintage clothing stores. I bought a poncho the colors of Mardi Gras. I did not buy the T-shirt that said "Rain, and Coffee, and Salmon, and Weed." The Dodgers lost the series, but I went to the bar to watch the game, and it was fine. It was actually nice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:35:55.20" data-timestamp="2155.2"> All right. So do you want to check levels?

And that seems like an OK outcome.</p><p begin="00:36:19.78" data-timestamp="2179.78">I take out the big mama worksheets I did over the weekend. Each sheet took a lot longer than I expected. Dr. Kaysen picks out a worksheet with the stuck point, I can't protect myself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:36:32.25" data-timestamp="2192.25"> OK, I can't protect myself.

The wolf beckons Little Red Riding Hood. She strays from the path, and then she sings, "He drew me close and he swallowed me down, down a dark slimy path where life's secrets that I never want to know and when everything familiar seemed to disappear forever." I mean, those lyrics described how I felt in the aftermath of the assault to a tee, that everything familiar seemed to disappear forever.</p><p begin="00:38:00.23" data-timestamp="2280.23">Dr. Kaysen and I walk through the worksheet, step by step, through all the prompts and questions CPT relies on-- whether there's evidence for my stuck point, whether I'm making an all or nothing statement, whether I'm jumping to conclusions, what I'm leaving out. I realize that I still feel angry with myself for freezing, that I didn't scream sooner, hit him, run, or defend myself. Dr. Kaysen reminds me that he had a knife.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:38:29.21" data-timestamp="2309.21"> If somebody's got a weapon, sometimes freezing is the best response in that moment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:38:36.98" data-timestamp="2316.98"> Or the only response.

By the end, I'm in a different place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:39:08.21" data-timestamp="2348.21"> And so you've managed to get that from 70% to 20%.

And fear came down, anger came down, and frustration came down. Nice. That's lovely.

Right. Beautiful job with that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:39:46.58" data-timestamp="2386.58"> Suddenly, I'm getting the worksheets. They're still difficult, because thinking is difficult. But that night, I find that doing them is calming and clear. The next day, in session seven, I tell Dr. Kaysen that there's something about the writing that's really key.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:40:04.88" data-timestamp="2404.88"> And so when I'm writing it down, I'm just seeing that even just subtle shifts are really different when you write it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:40:13.78" data-timestamp="2413.78"> That's right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:40:14.59" data-timestamp="2414.59"> I can see the beginning point.

I think that in talk therapy or traditional analysis, it's so individualized, it's so cocooned, it's so specified to your relationship with one person in that space and that time. And it's very much like a special thing.</p><p begin="00:41:08.29" data-timestamp="2468.29">Whereas a worksheet, it's an equation. And so it's more generic, which actually makes it way better in a lot of ways.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:41:17.52" data-timestamp="2477.52"> But also hard because it feels less special.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:41:19.59" data-timestamp="2479.59"> Right, but also kind of like not this precious thing.

I'm not sure that's true of talk therapy-- for me, anyway.</p><p begin="00:41:45.28" data-timestamp="2505.28">I don't set an end goal. With CPT, I have. I know exactly what I want to work on, and I'm drilling down on that one thing. I'm dealing with the after effects of sexual assault. And I have a list of stuck points to show for it-- 31 different sentences written sloppily on a piece of paper, like a list of groceries. Dr. Kaysen asks me if I've crossed any off.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:42:10.06" data-timestamp="2530.06"> I crossed off a bunch that I just didn't think were stuck points in the first place.

This morning, I rode the ferry and saw a double rainbow. I walked around Bainbridge Island with a friend and saw sun, real sun through trees and abandoned mills, sun shining against the sound, and against graffiti, and against soaring seagulls, sun that reflected on the sign for Bernie's Automotive Service that read, "Welcome to the team, Charlie." It all looked shining and miraculous. I could feel the excitement of being done. And the Pacific Northwest felt it with me.</p><p begin="00:50:57.42" data-timestamp="3057.42">Writing the second impact statement was easier than writing the first one.

I don't know why he molested me. I don't know what motivated him. I know that it didn't happen because I was there, or wearing boxers, or friendly, or willing it upon myself. I was young and walking to school, not looking for a sexual assault. That's pretty improbable. Why would anyone look for that?</p><p begin="00:51:40.15" data-timestamp="3100.15">I think it happened because-- I just really can't explain why. He was in control. He had a knife. I did everything I could to protect myself and to get away. My feelings after it happened were natural. My response was as good as it could be. Good is the wrong word, but I think I did OK, considering all of the circumstances.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:52:03.43" data-timestamp="3123.43"> I keep going.

Yep. That's what I heard, too. And also, really an acceptance that you may never know-- in fact, you probably will never know-- exactly why it happened.

Dr. Kaysen hands me a print-out of the PTSD check-ins that we did at the beginning of each session. By the end, my number has dropped from the initial total by about 12 points. She says 10 points indicates meaningful change. The number doesn't mean that much to me, but I do feel better. I know that. She wonders how I feel about the therapy, overall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:53:51.66" data-timestamp="3231.66"> What did you notice in the process? What was helpful for you? What was not helpful? How have you seen shifts?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:53:58.18" data-timestamp="3238.18"> Well, I've definitely seen-- I mean, I think working through all of this stuff about the assault was incredibly helpful, because I felt like there was a lot of unresolved assumptions that I didn't really even recognize were there. And that it was, frankly, kind of a relief to not really have that there as much. Like it just kind of feels better.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:54:27.84" data-timestamp="3267.84"> The process of CPT surprised me. Its effectiveness surprised me. I could see in just those two statements how the ten sessions in between shifted my thinking. This is like ninja therapy. They distract you with the weird language, and then progress creeps up on you from behind. As always, Dr. Kaysen is huggable, gracious, warm. I'm going to miss her. I'm sad to leave, even though I know it's time, and I know I can.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:55:00.67" data-timestamp="3300.67"> Is that it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:55:01.50" data-timestamp="3301.5"> That's it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:55:02.07" data-timestamp="3302.07"> That's the end?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Debra Kaysen</h4><p begin="00:55:03.13" data-timestamp="3303.13"> The end.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jaime Lowe</h4><p begin="00:55:04.79" data-timestamp="3304.79"> All right.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:55:14.40" data-timestamp="3314.4"> It's been 10 months since I did CPT. I still have my folder stuffed with more than 100 worksheets. The spine is reinforced with neon orange duct tape, because the folder is falling apart, but I'm not. I feel like I did, in fact, get something I wanted out of this, more than what I expected.</p><p begin="00:55:34.88" data-timestamp="3334.88">I don't feel as hopeless and incapacitated when I hear about other assaults. The news doesn't dictate my emotional state in the same way. When Jeffrey Epstein was found dead, I was angry on behalf of his victims. I shouted a few expletives and threw my phone on the ground, but I could still function. And really, that's a very rational reaction.</p><p begin="00:55:59.41" data-timestamp="3359.41">Before CPT, I had a lot of anxiety and overwhelming feelings. I was experiencing PTSD symptoms, which I didn't even realize. I had my suspicions that these intense emotions were related to the assault, but it was never named for me. Now, my symptoms are mostly gone. And when problems come up, I can work them through in my head, or I pull out a blank worksheet.</p><p begin="00:56:26.72" data-timestamp="3386.72">There's a surge of women seeking help right now. A National Sexual Assault hotline saw a 200% increase over normal volume after the Kavanaugh hearing. There was a 20% increase in calls after the R. Kelly doc aired. After the sentencing hearing of Larry Nassar, calls to the same hotline increased by 46%. Of course, so many survivors of sexual assault don't get any treatment at all-- not talk therapy, not CPT, nothing.</p><p begin="00:56:59.23" data-timestamp="3419.23">When I started CPT, it was hard to say I'd been sexually assaulted out loud. I think I carried a lot of shame-- the word I was most offended by. But now I can say it, and I can say it without crying. I was sexually assaulted when I was 13.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:26.35" data-timestamp="3446.35"> Jaime Lowe, she's the author of a memoir called <i>Mental.</i> In the month since she saw Dr. Debra Kaysen, Dr. Kaysen has moved from the University of Washington to Stanford.</p><p begin="00:57:36.12" data-timestamp="3456.12">[MUSIC - MARY J.
