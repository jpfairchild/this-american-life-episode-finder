<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.40" data-timestamp="0.4">We've been doing a lot of stories lately on the radio show about police. And they've been pretty heavy, we know. This is not a story like that. In fact, kind of the opposite.</p><p begin="00:00:10.65" data-timestamp="10.65">When Miles and Katie's apartment was robbed, they knew this was not going to be a big case. And if you got right down to it, they did not have a problem with that. New York City cops arrived after the burglary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:00:20.87" data-timestamp="20.87">They had probably just come from some sort of situation where someone had gotten stabbed in the neck. And now they're in these kind of yuppies' apartment, and we're running down this laundry list of things that had been stolen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:31.18" data-timestamp="31.18">And the list is like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:00:32.12" data-timestamp="32.12">Oh, it's so embarrassing. It's like, an iPad, an iPod, an Xbox.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.06" data-timestamp="39.06">They've got bigger problems.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:00:39.86" data-timestamp="39.86">Yeah, they got bigger fish to fry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.94" data-timestamp="41.94">Surveillance video from the building showed that the culprits were three teenagers who took the elevator to the top floor, probably jumped down onto a balcony, and then walked into Katie's and Miles' apartment through a sliding glass door. Then there's video of them leaving the building.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:00:57.01" data-timestamp="57.01">Three teenage guys with three of our backpacks, stuffed full.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:00.43" data-timestamp="60.43">Wow, so they're using your backpacks?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:02.11" data-timestamp="62.11">Our own backpacks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:03.17" data-timestamp="63.17">So they didn't even have any plans on how they're going to carry this out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:05.75" data-timestamp="65.75">I guess not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:01:06.36" data-timestamp="66.36">It didn't seem like a very well-thought-out caper. This was more of a-- let's break into this building and see if someone's dumb enough to leave their sliding glass door open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:14.52" data-timestamp="74.52">Of all the things they lost, the only thing that they actually cared about was their video camera. And they only cared about that because it had their wedding video on it-- the only copy. Katie filmed the wedding to show her brother but hadn't yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:25.23" data-timestamp="85.23">My brother, who I'm really close to, couldn't come to the wedding. And so it was really sentimental, and I really wanted it back. And I was really upset. I was really, really sad about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:34.99" data-timestamp="94.99">So the morning after the burglary, knowing the police were not going to be much help on this one, Katie decides to jump into action herself. She goes onto Craigslist to see if the thieves have put her camera up for sale there.</p><p begin="00:01:46.03" data-timestamp="106.03">And boom, she finds it immediately. Same camera in the same bag, with all the accessories that she had specially bought for the camera. It had to be hers. And she calls the detectives on the case, tells them the good news.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:57.35" data-timestamp="117.35">Like, I can get my camera, and I can probably put these guys in jail. And he just immediately shoots me down and says, you know, "there's no way of really knowing if that's your camera. We can't help you with anything. The only way we'd be able to help you is if you got the guy to give you a serial number off the camera and if you happen to still have the serial number from the camera, and they match." And I think he was just thinking, like, that'll never happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:27.11" data-timestamp="147.11">Katie, however, saves all her warranties in a special folder. She does have the serial number. And to confirm that it's the same as the advertised camera, she calls the guy on Craigslist and she concocts this story that she is a girl who needs to buy the camera for a school project.</p><p begin="00:02:43.64" data-timestamp="163.64">She puts on this supposedly tough-sounding Brooklyn accent that I would describe as kind of the Brooklyn accent you would hear performed by a kid actor on the Disney Channel. I made her do this for me. You do not want to hear it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:02:55.17" data-timestamp="175.17">And I told him that my boyfriend was going to kick my ass if I spent our last $300 buying a camera that broke the next day. And so, "Do you have the warranty for the camera?" And he said, "No." He was like, "Uh, I got this camera from my friend, so there was no warranty with it."</p><p begin="00:03:13.32" data-timestamp="193.32">I was like, "OK, well, do you know, like, is there a way to find out if it's still under warranty?" And he said, "Well, I think you can find out if the camera's under warranty if you go online." And I was like, "OK, well, what do I need to do?" And he was like, "Well, I think you need to have the serial number."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:30.12" data-timestamp="210.12">So you didn't actually just ask him for the serial number. You wanted him to suggest the serial number?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:03:34.45" data-timestamp="214.45">Yeah. Yeah. Because I thought if I asked him for the serial number, then he would know right away what I was trying to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:39.48" data-timestamp="219.48">Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:03:39.65" data-timestamp="219.65">So I was trying to get him to say it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:42.33" data-timestamp="222.33">She asked him, "Can you read me the serial number?" And he says he doesn't have the camera with them. He'll have to call her back. And she figures, oh, that's it. The jig is up. He knows she's lying. He will never call back.</p><p begin="00:03:52.70" data-timestamp="232.7">As Miles points out, this story that she has made up, it really makes no sense at all. Like, OK, she's got a sociopath boyfriend.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:03:59.31" data-timestamp="239.31">Who would beat up his girlfriend over the very nerdy error of buying a video camera that wasn't under warranty.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:06.77" data-timestamp="246.77">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:04:07.22" data-timestamp="247.22">[LAUGHS] It wasn't like he was drunk and he found her cheating on him or anything. He was like, he's violent enough to beat somebody up, but only if they buy a video camera that we don't have a warranty for.</p><p begin="00:04:18.37" data-timestamp="258.37">(IN HOLLYWOOD BROOKLYN ACCENT) Because God forbid something should happen, you know, and this camera breaks down. "We can't get our money back! We can't get it repaired! You know what's gonna happen." It's like, what?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:32.72" data-timestamp="272.72">And then the guy calls back. Gives her the serial number. Of course it matches. Katie calls the detective to let him know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:04:40.66" data-timestamp="280.66">He says, "Oh, really? Well, what should we do?" [LAUGHS] And I was like, "You tell me what we should do. You're the detective."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:51.31" data-timestamp="291.31">And he says, "Of course, we'll do a sting. Call the guy and arrange to buy the camera from him. Set a location. We'll be there, too. We'll swoop in. We'll nab him."</p><p begin="00:05:01.25" data-timestamp="301.25">15 minutes later, the police arrive to take Katie and Miles to the sting. Katie runs downstairs to meet the detective on the street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:07.93" data-timestamp="307.93">He tells me that there's been a change of plans. He doesn't need my husband to come anymore. He only needs me. I'm not going to meet the burglar face-to-face anymore, because it's not safe. And so he's got a different plan of how we're going to do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:23.96" data-timestamp="323.96">At that point, Miles arrives downstairs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:26.06" data-timestamp="326.06">I turn around to him and I just say, "Change of plans. They don't need us both anymore. They just need me. It's not safe for you to go. I'll call you when it's over."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:38.51" data-timestamp="338.51">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:39.91" data-timestamp="339.91">[LAUGHTER] And he's, like, stunned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:44.41" data-timestamp="344.41">(LAUGHING) 'Cause that's not alarming at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:46.59" data-timestamp="346.59">(LAUGHING) Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:49.24" data-timestamp="349.24">Miles watches her get into the car and drive off. Inside the car, Katie says, the detectives tell her the new plan. She's going to stay in the car and talk to the guy on the cellphone, keep him talking as the cops go and grab them-- though they are very skeptical.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:06:02.11" data-timestamp="362.11">Basically saying, like, "The chance of this working out is so small." Like, "This is never going to happen.

<h3>Act One: Theater of War</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:18.51" data-timestamp="498.51">Act One, "Theater of War." Sometimes a big professional outfit that is great at one thing takes on a task at which it has no experience at all, and really no special aptitude for in any way. It is a rank amateur. Jack Hitt has this example.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:08:35.95" data-timestamp="515.95">Back when the first President Bush was in office, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. And for the first time since Vietnam, really, America returned to the battlefield. Derrick Brown felt called. And so he wound up at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, one of the largest military bases in the world. Back then, about 40,000 soldiers-- most famously, the 82nd Airborne and other Ready Units that can be deployed in 18 hours.</p><p begin="00:09:00.55" data-timestamp="540.55">Fort Bragg is America's waiting room for war. When Derrick first arrived, he was trained as a paratrooper.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:09:06.70" data-timestamp="546.7">You know, you'd wake up at 5:00 in the morning. Then you would deploy out to the field. You'd do a jump from 800 feet. I was an artilleryman, so they'd throw the tanks out of the planes. Then they'd throw us out of the planes. So you'd do these mock war exercises where people would try and attack you and kill you, and you'd be out in the cold, and you'd be digging more foxholes, and just seeing how ground down you could possibly be, so that when the time comes for war, your body and mind have been pushed as far as possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:09:39.82" data-timestamp="579.82">Every once in a while, there'd be something else-- a volunteer duty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:09:43.46" data-timestamp="583.46">I remember the captain of our unit, he said he had this strange detail, which was we had to mandatorily send one soldier from our battery to be a part of this musical. And it would last several weeks. You wouldn't have to do any field duty, but you would have to sing and dance.</p><p begin="00:10:07.06" data-timestamp="607.06">And everyone thought he was joking. And I raised my hand. And he said, "Great. Report to the Fort Bragg theater today."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:10:21.24" data-timestamp="621.24">Were you the only person who volunteered for this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:10:23.57" data-timestamp="623.57">I was the only person who volunteered. And they had me sit in this room, and this director first had everyone audition. And he asked if I knew of any songs that I could sing from any musicals. And I said, "Not at all."</p><p begin="00:10:39.50" data-timestamp="639.5">I had never sang or danced in my life, except while running and singing cadences and Jody calls in the military. And he said, "Well, just sing me something."

And it turns out that no one was turned away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:19.72" data-timestamp="679.72">In rehearsals, Derrick quickly got a sense that something different was going on here. This was not just your average musical revue.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:26.56" data-timestamp="686.56">What kind of dancing are you doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:11:29.46" data-timestamp="689.46">It's march dancing. I don't know if you've seen it, but it is the director's idea to combine the honor and discipline of military movements with the bravado and panache of Broadway movements.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:52.67" data-timestamp="712.67">But the thing Derrick remembers most, more than 20 years later, was not the song-and-dance numbers. It was the stuff in between. There were short films projected on the screen above the performers. And they were opposite of lighthearted entertainment-- grim testimonials about soldiers who'd died. Not in combat, but drunk driving and in other accidents near the base, all done in a dark bluntness one rarely sees outside driver's ed movies.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:12:20.14" data-timestamp="740.14">We'd go from show tune to a video on the screen of a fellow soldier that they'd interviewed talking about how one of their fellow soldiers, their friend, died. And then-- uh-oh, surprise! We would sing a show tune.</p><p begin="00:12:36.89" data-timestamp="756.89">And it was this progression of dance, sad video, sing a bit, sad video. And then some guys come rappelling out of the ceiling for the closing number at the end of the hour, for the final chance to cheer everyone up so they leave feeling inspired. It was insane.</p><p begin="00:12:57.26" data-timestamp="777.26">We would have discussions backstage, which is what the-- what are we doing? Why are we doing this? How did this-- how did this thing even come to be?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:13:09.86" data-timestamp="789.86">Excellent questions. How did one of the most straitlaced, no-nonsense institutions in the entire country, the US Army, end up producing this piece of Dada musical theater? I wanted answers. So I went straight up the chain of command.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>General Carl Stiner</h4><p begin="00:13:25.78" data-timestamp="805.78">Yes, I'm General Carl Stiner, US Army, retired. And I was the Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division during 1987 and 1988.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:13:35.99" data-timestamp="815.99">General Stiner was at Fort Bragg. And he confirmed that yes, for a while in the '70s, '80s, and early '90s, there was this annual show which the entire base was required to attend. So there were three or four performances a day for a week or so during the Christmas season, which is when accidental deaths spiked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>General Carl Stiner</h4><p begin="00:13:53.28" data-timestamp="833.28">We realized that we were having more casualties from off-duty activities-- mainly motorcycles-- than from thousands of parachute jumps and heavy equipment drops. You know, we just needed to do something about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:14:11.70" data-timestamp="851.7">Stiner told me that some years, for every death of a soldier during training exercises, there were almost 10 killed getting drunk and driving crazy. Wartime deaths, we all know about, and after-war PTSD. But this was a whole other kind of statistic-- pre-combat deaths-- which come when tens of thousands of teenagers anxiously awaiting war get pumped up jumping out of planes and firing heavy artillery. How could some beer and, say, a motorcycle possibly affect them?</p><p begin="00:14:43.28" data-timestamp="883.28">Originally, the base had ordered mandatory safety lectures. But the soldiers just slept through them. So the United States Defense Department, the greatest fighting force ever to march on the planet, decided they would try show tunes. And that's the origin of what came to be called <i>The</i> <i>Soldier</i> <i>Safety</i> <i>Show.</i></p><p begin="00:15:03.11" data-timestamp="903.11">I interviewed a dozen veterans from this era, and they all remember the weird mash-up of gut-wrenching testimonials and cheery eye-high leg kicks. They all said, "You had to see it to believe it." And I wanted to believe it.</p><p begin="00:15:17.69" data-timestamp="917.69">When I called Stiner, he told me that he had a videotape of one of the shows.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>General Carl Stiner</h4><p begin="00:15:21.25" data-timestamp="921.25">You know, I had a VCR of it. But age caused the thing to self-destruct. You couldn't even tell what it was, the pictures and so on. And so we struck out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:15:35.95" data-timestamp="935.95">I won't bore you with the details. But finding a videotape literally took months. The public school library had a set of <i>Soldier</i> <i>Safety</i> <i>Shows,</i> but not long before I called, they went full-on digital and junked all their old school audiovisual stuff. A Freedom of Information request came up completely dry.</p><p begin="00:15:54.06" data-timestamp="954.06">Finally, I happened upon Gudron Blackmon, still working at Bragg, who called back to say she had an old box at home and, in it, a tape. The label read, "1989 Soldier Safety Show-- Life is Worth Living."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Folk Guitarist</h4><p begin="00:16:09.34" data-timestamp="969.34">(SINGING) This road of life we travel, it can take us many ways.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:16:14.79" data-timestamp="974.79">Early on, we see a folk guitarist seated onstage, plucking out a sad melody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Folk Guitarist</h4><p begin="00:16:19.59" data-timestamp="979.59">(SINGING) But for all of these young soldiers whose lives had just begun--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:16:25.15" data-timestamp="985.15">Above him, on a screen, is a general.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme and bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show-- "Amateur Hour," stories of how amateurs can accomplish things that the pros cannot. That is, when they are not crashing and burning completely.</p><p begin="00:29:27.69" data-timestamp="1767.69">We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, "What to Expect When You're Expecting a Robot."</p><p begin="00:29:33.68" data-timestamp="1773.68">There's this thing that a lot of kids have to do in health class. Maybe you did this when you were in high school. The idea is to give students a taste of what it is like to be responsible for an infant-- and kind of what a pain in the ass it is, actually. And they do this by making the kids carry around an egg-- or sometimes it's, like, a sack of flour-- for a couple days. Supposedly this jolt of reality helps prevent teen pregnancies. Which, you know, is a lot to ask of an egg.</p><p begin="00:29:58.13" data-timestamp="1798.13">So these days, some schools are using these robotic babies. These are plastic dolls with electronics inside which make them cry randomly, all day and night. Their sleeping, eating, and pooping patterns are based on logs kept by real parents about real babies. The babies cost over $600 each. Hillary Frank went out to find out if amateur parenthood is more intense and realistic with these high-tech crybabies.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:30:23.08" data-timestamp="1823.08">The first time I saw a robotic baby was at my local pharmacy. It was one of those old-timey places with a candy counter and surgical supplies and a large selection of scented candles. One day I was in the store, and I heard this teenage girl behind me say, "My god, this baby is so heavy." She had a car seat slung over her shoulder like a purse. For a second I thought the plastic baby inside it was real.</p><p begin="00:30:47.53" data-timestamp="1847.53">"The real ones are heavier," I told her. She groaned and whipped the car seat over to her other shoulder. At the time I had a three-year-old, and I was dying to know if this girl's experience with the plastic baby was anything remotely like my experience with my flesh-and-blood baby.</p><p begin="00:31:04.50" data-timestamp="1864.5">The girl told me she went to Glen Ridge High. Glen Ridge is the town next to mine in New Jersey. So I called the school and asked if they'd let me hang out the next time the girls got the babies.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robot Baby</h4><p begin="00:31:13.98" data-timestamp="1873.98">[WAILING]</p><p begin="00:31:16.47" data-timestamp="1876.47"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:31:17.47" data-timestamp="1877.47">Oh, and don't forget to support her neck when you pick her up out of the car seat.

But the moments when Rachel and Paige couldn't be available to the babies-- when Rachel gave blood, when Paige fell-- the girls lost points in those moments. When you're a real parent, those things happen all the time.</p><p begin="00:47:10.95" data-timestamp="2830.95">Diagnosing whether your kid needs to be fed or diapered or rocked, that's not what makes you a pro at parenting.

<h3>Act Three: Commander In Brief</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:54.73" data-timestamp="2874.73">Act Three. "Commander In Brief." Now we have the story of an amateur who, for one night, gets thrown into a very, very big job, one of the biggest jobs. They basically get thrown in as the substitute teacher for a class they have never taught or never taken-- specifically, they're supposed to sub for the President of the United States. Stephanie Foo explains.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:17.91" data-timestamp="2897.91">If somebody needs to sub for the President, the chain is clear. If the Vice President can't do it, it goes to the Speaker of the House, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, then the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, all the way down the Cabinet to Energy, Education, Veteran Affairs. It's been this way since the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. But what happens if all of those people are in one room?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>President Barack Obama</h4><p begin="00:48:45.34" data-timestamp="2925.34">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:53.14" data-timestamp="2933.14">The State of the Union address. What if someone blows up the building and kills everyone on that list all at once? Well, then the presidency goes to the designated survivor.</p><p begin="00:49:05.00" data-timestamp="2945">That is a person chosen every year before the State of the Union speech to survive. That's their whole job-- to survive, run the United States government as an amateur president, total beginner, whose first day on the job may include wreaking vengeance upon-slash-surrendering to whoever killed all our top leaders.</p><p begin="00:49:26.10" data-timestamp="2966.1">Each year, the designated survivor is assigned a security detail and moved to a safe, secret location away from the Capitol. This all began-- no surprise-- during the Cold War. Thomas Reed was an assistant to President Reagan for national security policy. And it was his job to figure out what to do if a nuclear weapon hit DC. He's the one who came up with the idea of the designated survivor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:49:48.68" data-timestamp="2988.68">Washington was targeted with over 300 Soviet nuclear weapons. They had hundreds laid that were going to lay down on every possible escape route. And to think you could escape that barrage was nonsense.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Bill Richardson</h4><p begin="00:50:01.72" data-timestamp="3001.72">Well, I was nervous in that I remember saying, "Jeez, I know this is not going to happen. What if something does happen?"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:11.00" data-timestamp="3011">That's Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy, designated survivor for the 2000 State of the Union. Richardson wasn't sent into a bunker somewhere. He was in a small town in Maryland having dinner at his friend's house, which was surrounded by a security detail and emergency vehicles. Inside, they had steak.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Bill Richardson</h4><p begin="00:50:30.34" data-timestamp="3030.34">We had a nice meal. But then we sat in front of the television, and I was smoking a cigar. I had a glass of wine after it was all over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:41.01" data-timestamp="3041.01">I talked to a couple of designated survivors from the Cold War era, who said they were put on planes and flown to undisclosed locations. One of them got training where he got to play war games in this secret <i>Doctor</i> <i>Strangelove</i>-esque setting. And they asked him questions like, "OK, do you swear in immediately after the President's death? Do you launch missiles at the Soviets? Do you hold your fire?"</p><p begin="00:51:04.84" data-timestamp="3064.84">He said the training was so helpful, so enlightening, that he thought nobody should become a designated survivor without undergoing it first. But by the end of the Cold War-- post-Gorbachev, pre-9/11-- things got a little more lax.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:51:20.13" data-timestamp="3080.13">Can you say that I went through any kind of training course about what to do? The answer is no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:25.04" data-timestamp="3085.04">That's Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, designated survivor during the 1997 State of the Union.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:51:31.50" data-timestamp="3091.5">I think I did discuss it with my wife, that I could handle it something terrible happened.

And she didn't even leave the neighborhood. She was just two and a half miles away from the Capitol-- at the White House.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Donna Shalala</h4><p begin="00:51:52.17" data-timestamp="3112.17">So I took my senior staff to the Roosevelt Room at the White House, and we had pizza and watched the State of the Union. And I sort of wandered into the Oval Office and tried out the chair.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:02.83" data-timestamp="3122.83">What did it feel like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Donna Shalala</h4><p begin="00:52:04.45" data-timestamp="3124.45">Big.

You have to look attentive and interested and approving for a really long time, in case the cameras pan to you. Being designated survivor? Much easier.</p><p begin="00:52:28.74" data-timestamp="3148.74">One guy, who asked I not use his name, went on a vacation to the Caribbean when he got the gig. Not a government expense, he was quick to tell me. He happened to have plans to go anyway. Another designated survivor took the opportunity to move to a new house. A caravan of Secret Service guarded him as he loaded up his moving van.</p><p begin="00:52:48.90" data-timestamp="3168.9">One thing you might have noticed from the designated survivors I spoke to-- none of them had day jobs that had anything to do with national security. Usually it's the non-marquee Cabinet members-- Secretary of the Interior, Energy, Commerce, Agriculture-- people whose names you probably don't know. Ever heard of Anthony Foxx? He's our Secretary of Transportation-- and this year's designated survivor.</p><p begin="00:53:12.74" data-timestamp="3192.74">And when I heard about that, I kind of thought, well, seriously? The decision to launch nuclear retaliation, kill millions of people, could possibly rest in the hands of the Secretary of Transportation? Thomas Reed, the guy who designed this program, says, "Why not? The Secretary of Transportation is as good a person as any."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:32.10" data-timestamp="3212.1">The question in politics, and all other things in life, is, "Compared to who?" The question is not, "Is So-and-so authorized or qualified to be President, or Governor, or successor? The question is, "Compared to who?" Compared to Joseph Stalin? Of course. Compared to Dwight Eisenhower? Probably not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:51.54" data-timestamp="3231.54">And the Cabinet, they're all brilliant people, and certainly have the wherewithal to at least make the initial decisions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:00.27" data-timestamp="3240.27">[CHUCKLES QUIETLY] Stephanie, they're not all brilliant people, any more than you or I are.

But you know, I have enough confidence in myself that if something were to happen, I would have followed certain basic rules, and would have been a good soldier, in that case.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:56.65" data-timestamp="3296.65">When Glickman was a designated survivor, they flew him to LaGuardia Airport in a G3 plane, along with some stern-looking guys in suits-- one of whom may or may not have been carrying the nuclear football in a fancy briefcase. Then they got Glickman in a three-car caravan, drove him to his daughter's modest apartment in Manhattan's West Village, and stood guard outside while he watched the speech on TV. Glickman admitted he did imagine what it would be like.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:55:21.59" data-timestamp="3321.59">I did think about it. It was a very interesting thing that here, the Secretary of Agriculture could be President of the United States. And I'd been telling the world all these years that agriculture was the most important part of our government, so you know, I could reinforce that message, certainly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:36.76" data-timestamp="3336.76">[LAUGHS] All of a sudden, that would be our number-one national agenda, is just agriculture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:55:42.53" data-timestamp="3342.53">Agriculture. Food and agriculture.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:44.73" data-timestamp="3344.73">Glickman even said that in his regular job, he was so unimportant that immediately after the speech was over, he lost the security detail. They bailed on him and went back to Washington.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:55:54.32" data-timestamp="3354.32">In fact, their exact words were, "Mr. Glickman, the mission is terminated." And I decided to stay in New York and have dinner with my daughter. And it was cold and raining and sleeting, and once the dinner was over, we went outside of the restaurant, and we couldn't find a cab.</p><p begin="00:56:11.68" data-timestamp="3371.68">So we walked back, about 12 blocks, back to my daughter's apartment in a sleet storm. And it struck me that just three or four hours before, I was the most powerful man on the face of the Earth, for about an hour. And now I couldn't even get a cab.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:56:30.14" data-timestamp="3390.14">The fact of the matter is, no first-term president goes into office knowing how to be president. He learns on the job. Everything's new.</p><p begin="00:56:38.17" data-timestamp="3398.17">And opening that briefcase and deciding whether to launch a nuclear strike? Nobody could be ready for that. The President might be as likely to make the wrong choice as the Secretary of Agriculture.
