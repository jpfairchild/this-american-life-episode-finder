<h3>Act One: Day</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.14" data-timestamp="1.14"> There are certain things you should really only say to your best friend. This is probably one of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:00:06.29" data-timestamp="6.29"> Do you ever just shut up and just listen to somebody?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott</h4><p begin="00:00:08.29" data-timestamp="8.29"> Go right ahead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:00:09.00" data-timestamp="9"> That's what-- spill it out there, brother.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott</h4><p begin="00:00:11.93" data-timestamp="11.93"> I already did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:13.60" data-timestamp="13.6"> Tom and Scott are in an all-night diner around midnight. Scott is disheveled and tired. He's been working all night as a bartender at a Chinese restaurant, serving lots of free drinks on the sly to Tom. And Tom, in response, seems astonishingly ungrateful. Here is the kind of sass that Tom keeps throwing Scott's way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:00:31.55" data-timestamp="31.55"> You're the-- you're the one who needed the food and the beers and all that stuff like that to calm down after your traumatic night stealing from your employer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:42.28" data-timestamp="42.28"> Really?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:43.03" data-timestamp="43.03"> Just at that moment, a man in a Hawaiian print shirt and khaki pants walks by their table. He hears the word "employer," mistakes it for the word "lawyer," and then turns to Tom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:54.20" data-timestamp="54.2"> Are you a lawyer?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:00:56.37" data-timestamp="56.37"> No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:56.86" data-timestamp="56.86"> No. Do you want to be?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:00:58.72" data-timestamp="58.72"> Who brought up a lawyer to start with? You just came-- walked in--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:01.19" data-timestamp="61.19"> You did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:01.57" data-timestamp="61.57"> No, I didn't. Not at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott</h4><p begin="00:01:03.34" data-timestamp="63.34"> He didn't say lawyer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:04.27" data-timestamp="64.27"> You thought that you heard something and then you let your mind take over and then it got you in-- it put you in--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:09.16" data-timestamp="69.16"> Well, I am a lawyer, so that's probably why I might have thought that. But you know what? I'm trained in the art of listening, and I could've sworn you said you wanted to be a lawyer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:20.23" data-timestamp="80.23"> Well, I definitely wouldn't hire you because you heard completely wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:23.55" data-timestamp="83.55"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:24.23" data-timestamp="84.23"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:29.30" data-timestamp="89.3"> There's some conversations that you overhear and it's hard not to want to keep listening or to butt in, even though everybody knows that it is not the right thing to do. One Sunday morning a while back, I was sitting in one of the booths in this very diner, the Golden Apple, in Chicago on Lincoln Avenue, and I looked around the restaurant. The table next to me, a family was taking their teenage daughter out to an awkward last breakfast before she shipped out with the military. There were dressed-up people who'd come in from the church across the street, and young couples who'd stumbled in with the paper and were working on the crossword together. And I thought, if only somebody could interview every person at every table in this restaurant. That would be amazing. You'd get such a wide variety of different kinds of stories from different kinds of people. So we decided to try it.</p><p begin="00:02:18.31" data-timestamp="138.31">One Friday night, a big group of us took shifts starting at 5:00 AM and going to 5:00 AM the next morning. During quiet hours, it was just one of us on duty, recording and interviewing people. During the busiest hours, which means late night, three or four of us worked the tables. We first broadcast today's program all the way back in 2000, and we'll be running it again today. From WBEZ Chicago, today's show, "24 Hours at the Golden Apple." It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay tuned.</p></div> </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act Two: Night</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="subject"><h4>Pete</h4><p begin="00:02:57.08" data-timestamp="177.08"> It's 5 o'clock in the morning. My name is Pete. I work from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM, and now we're going to have the taxi drivers and the cops, you know, come for a cup of coffee until 6 o'clock, the morning crowd is going to be in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:14.36" data-timestamp="194.36"> Pete's one of the three owners of this restaurant, along with Nick and Tom. All three are Greek, and one of them is always there 24 hours a day. The restaurant sits at one of those intersections where three streets come together, not two, so every one of the corners in the intersection is wedge-shaped, which means that the restaurant itself is wedge-shaped, with booths along the windows on two sides of the wedge.</p><p begin="00:03:36.40" data-timestamp="216.4">There's a counter with stools and a larger room with tables in the back. There are those oversized, laminated menus that go on for pages-- pages-- with pictures of the food. By the door is one of those revolving dessert cases, an octagon made of glass. Three shelves of cream pies and melon slices and cakes. Lately, it's been nothing but trouble. Here's Nick, another one of the owners.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick</h4><p begin="00:03:57.43" data-timestamp="237.43"> It's supposed to be turning. It's not turning because the motor broke. Jimmy's supposed to come out like three days ago. He's still coming. Now, if you can figure this one out, the-- the pie case is not turning. And believe it or not, it's not selling as good. That's-- that's a truth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:16.21" data-timestamp="256.21"> Dessert sales are down, he says, by half, ever since it broke. People just like desserts more when they're in motion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick</h4><p begin="00:04:23.53" data-timestamp="263.53"> It catches the eye. You know, when it's turning, it catches the eye and it sells.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:31.03" data-timestamp="271.03"> Over the course of 24 hours, the staff of the Golden Apple changes, the regulars who come in change, and the atmosphere changes, from quiet in the early morning to crazy hectic late at night when the bars in the neighborhood let out. Nancy Updike took the first shift of our 24-hour surveillance, mic in hand, from 5:00 AM till 10:00 AM.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:04:55.11" data-timestamp="295.11"> This is Eddie. He comes to the Golden Apple a few times a week in the mornings and plays the harmonica in the middle of the restaurant for a few minutes. He's in a pale blue shirt and hopping lightly from foot to foot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eddie</h4><p begin="00:05:07.35" data-timestamp="307.35"> I might fall down.</p><p begin="00:05:08.65" data-timestamp="308.65">[HARMONICA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:11.40" data-timestamp="311.4"> Eddie heads to the back of the restaurant to play there. No one is complaining. No one is rolling their eyes. In fact, a few people are smiling and saying hi. Eddie is not an outsider here. He's a regular.</p><p begin="00:05:24.84" data-timestamp="324.84">Early morning at the Golden Apple is like that, a profoundly democratic place. Early morning welcomes the night shift workers, the unemployed, the retired, the confused, the disappointed, the slightly off. The people who work for themselves and the people who don't work at all anymore, but crave a little morning routine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:05:44.43" data-timestamp="344.43"> Every morning, I'm here between 4:30 and 5:00. I love the Golden Apple. They're wonderful people. They got good food. And that's it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:56.16" data-timestamp="356.16"> This is how Joe Molica ends every sentence.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:05:59.14" data-timestamp="359.14"> And that's it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:00.99" data-timestamp="360.99"> Or sometimes--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:06:01.89" data-timestamp="361.89"> And that's all I could tell you, honey.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:04.29" data-timestamp="364.29"> Joe's not used to talking about himself. His story comes out bit by bit. Our entire conversation takes place in a different era. He's completely unselfconscious about calling me honey. He bangs on his coffee cup with his spoon to get the waitresses attention for a refill. Please don't try this at home, but he gets away with it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:06:24.48" data-timestamp="384.48"> I do construction, remodeling, rehab. And that's what I do. I retired. I'm 78 years old. And I gave the business to my two sons and that's it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:38.13" data-timestamp="398.13"> How did you start that business?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:06:40.47" data-timestamp="400.47"> Through my dad. My dad done the same thing. When I was, I don't know, maybe 10, 11 years old, I started working for him. He was paying me a dime an hour and that was it. Clean up, sweep up the floors that he's working on. What else you want to know, honey?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:07:01.53" data-timestamp="421.53"> At 5:30 in the morning, almost everyone is sitting alone, by choice, it seems. Joe's friend Bob is sitting in his own booth behind Joe. No one's talking much, but it's a comfortable silence. When you're up this early, it's hard not to feel some sense of community with everyone else who's awake. But you don't necessarily want to talk to them.</p><p begin="00:07:22.59" data-timestamp="442.59">As it gets lighter and lighter outside, more people trickle in.

Not fat, just big.</p><p begin="00:08:42.35" data-timestamp="522.35">John has been eating at the Golden Apple and supplying its meats for 10 years.

The trick is, at the end, not to cut your hands when it comes really small. You got to use a special kind of thing that's underneath the band saw, not to put your hand in it because the band saw doesn't have any friends. I mean, if it's going to grab your hand, it's going to cut it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:02.01" data-timestamp="602.01"> The front of the Golden Apple is the smoking section.

And if you don't have an office you need to get to, why rush? Donna, the waitress, is finishing up the night shift and getting ready to go home. She's been on since 11:00 PM, but you would never know it to look at her. She's six feet tall and looks like Catherine Deneuve.

Every once in a while, on her afternoon off, she'll go see a play starring one of the actors who come in every night after their own shifts waiting tables. Her customers give her tapes of the bands they're in, bring in their artwork for her see, tell her about their successes and failures.

And then she realized she couldn't change him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:04.23" data-timestamp="1444.23"> Over by the restaurant's front windows, which look out on St. Alphonsus Catholic church, a huge building, sits Kay Frank, known to our friends as Katie Keane, 75 years old, dressed in a nice outfit and matching scarf. She's here because one of her longtime neighbors, another Golden Apple customer, is laid out dead in the funeral home right across the street. She'll eat and pay her respects. She tells me that she's lived her whole life within walking distance of this very spot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:24:28.78" data-timestamp="1468.78"> Yeah. I was born and raised on Lakewood 75 years ago. Went to St. Alphonsus School, so this is my neighborhood for a long time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:37.39" data-timestamp="1477.39"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:24:38.68" data-timestamp="1478.68"> And it gives me a lot of pleasure to walk the neighborhood and say, Margaret Kuntz lived in that house, Lucille Sutchell lived in that house. I can still see all the things in my mind as I did in the '30s and '40s.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:01.80" data-timestamp="1501.8"> Back then, for instance, a pharmacy was on this spot. Kay and her friends would come here after 11 o'clock mass.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:25:08.08" data-timestamp="1508.08"> I'm talking about first year, second year high school, when you didn't go to the kiddie mass anymore at 9 o'clock in the morning. This was like a hangout here after mass. And this whole section here, they had a wonderful soda fountain. It was right here where this would be. See what I'm saying?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:28.03" data-timestamp="1528.03"> She points at a section of booths. For years, this neighborhood was all about which parish you belonged to. St. Alphonsus for the Germans, St. Andrews for the Irish and Italian, St. Josaphat for the Polish. Till finally, in the 1960s, that ended. Kay's five sisters and her parents all moved away from the neighborhood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:25:45.25" data-timestamp="1545.25"> I'm the only one that stayed in the neighborhood because we couldn't afford to move out of here. We bought our house in the mid-'60s, '64. And everybody thought the neighborhood was going to change. So of course, they're moving to the suburbs or farther north or farther west.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:02.49" data-timestamp="1562.49"> Change? You mean people thought it wasn't going to be white anymore?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:26:05.17" data-timestamp="1565.17"> They thought-- yes. They thought it was going to go down. That's why people were scared and moved out. So we couldn't afford to move, so we bought a house there for $27,000. I've had offers of $500,000, $550,000 for my house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:24.14" data-timestamp="1584.14"> Meanwhile, one of her sisters who moved away to avoid the blight of this area, who moved to an area too expensive for Kay or her husband to afford, just sold her house for only $200,000. Gentrification, which spread through this neighborhood in the last 15 years, hasn't made it out to where her sisters live. But around here, on Southport and on Clark and all over, there are little boutiques and several Starbucks, and expensive restaurants with fake European names.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:26:48.64" data-timestamp="1608.64"> The neighborhood has changed a lot, you know? A whole lot. Some for the better, some for the worse. Close by, we have our gay people, which we never had as a kid. They were around, maybe, but we didn't know who they were. Today, you know who they are.</p><p begin="00:27:11.27" data-timestamp="1631.27">My husband, coming from the old school-- we have the nicest neighbors we've ever had, two gay men. They can't do enough for you. They cut your grass for you. They water-- now that I'm older. And when they moved in, my husband, coming from way back, oh, my god, you know, he didn't want really too much to do with them.</p><p begin="00:27:44.95" data-timestamp="1664.95">Within a year, I'd say, we saw that they were nice people, very clean. And when we had our 50th wedding anniversary party, had some [NON-ENGLISH] here, it was our neighbors that went to the hall without any-- they wouldn't take a penny. They decorated that place like you wouldn't believe. Now, how many neighbors would do that for you, you know?</p><p begin="00:28:10.12" data-timestamp="1690.12">So gay or not gay, they're really nice people. So I think that the gays can be credited for being such a nice people. They swayed a lot of the old-time people into different thinking. There's still a lot of racial stuff. Maybe if you had a black neighbor here, or one of the people would rent to a black person, I think they'd be frowned upon a little bit. But if you rent to a gay person today, it's OK.</p><p begin="00:28:52.38" data-timestamp="1732.38">A lot of things that we think should be this way and that way as you grow up, it's really not that way, shouldn't be that way. So I don't feel that we should really judge them, you know? Let the Lord judge them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:17.36" data-timestamp="1757.36"> Coming up, drunks, partyers, people on the make, and lots of other people to try not to judge.

Actually, she doesn't try. He won't come.

I think that she feels like we're growing apart because I-- I've kind of been mean lately. Not like-- not like too mean. But like, she's my best friend. She will always be my best friend. It's just like now that we live together, we have constant each other. And it's just like we realize the things that we could overlook before are actual issues now.</p><p begin="00:41:46.35" data-timestamp="2506.35">Like, we're complete opposites. She doesn't like people. I love people. She likes staying home and reading. I can't stand staying home and I can't stand reading. And I mean, I don't-- I don't like thinking. It's like thinking is something you do in school, and then when you need to.</p><p begin="00:42:05.00" data-timestamp="2525">And she is not like that, and that's very cool. I mean, it shows that, you know, she's not a robot or whatever, you know? But she's 17. She's only 17. And she acts like she's 23. She's, I guess, above, you know, the normal teenager. She thinks of things. She-- she cares, you know?</p><p begin="00:42:29.06" data-timestamp="2549.06">And that's what people in college do and that's what, you know, older people do. But me and most of all my friends, we're not ready. We're not-- we don't want to do that, you know? We want to-- we want to just sit back and have fun.</p><p begin="00:42:43.05" data-timestamp="2563.05">I mean, she just needs to find the right people to hang out with. And for right now, it's not my thing. This is my thing. I like this scene, where it's just like, we're going to sit back. We're going to have fun. We're going to laugh. We're just going to let everything go, you know? Just like, all right. The Golden Apple scene. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:11.53" data-timestamp="2591.53"> When she's back in the restaurant, after all this thinking about how she and Allison are so different, she heads over to her best friend. They started a band together called Mixed Emotions, just the two of them. Allison plays guitar. They both sing. And they do one of their songs together now for the microphone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:43:27.98" data-timestamp="2607.98"> Ready?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Both</h4><p begin="00:43:31.43" data-timestamp="2611.43"> (SINGING) So much for faith, so much for loving you.

The guys who they've been waiting for, who they called six times, Jeff, he never arrived. But there is another Jeff with this group, and Allison transfers her crush to Jeff number two. At some point, Danielle drags her outside the diner to confer. They stand on the sidewalk, just on the other side of the plate glass window Jeff number two and everybody else. Allison reviews the facts of the case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:45:05.27" data-timestamp="2705.27"> Well, it's just like, OK, he's-- you know, he's into some of the supernatural stuff too--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:45:08.96" data-timestamp="2708.96"> Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:45:09.27" data-timestamp="2709.27"> --and we have a lot of things in common.

He smiles a big number two smile, then he and Allison sit alone at a table and talk for a while until Danielle comes over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:46:07.17" data-timestamp="2767.17"> Are we leaving now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:09.39" data-timestamp="2769.39"> Yes, we paid and we left a tip, and I put the rest of the change in this little box here.
