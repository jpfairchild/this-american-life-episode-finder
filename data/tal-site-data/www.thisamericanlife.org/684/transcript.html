<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:11.41" data-timestamp="11.41"> OK, so let's start here. This is a training video for firefighters in Amsterdam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:16.43" data-timestamp="16.43"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:16.87" data-timestamp="16.87"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:00:17.97" data-timestamp="17.97"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:18.72" data-timestamp="18.72"> Three firemen in an office, drinking coffee, catching up-- and then, one of them, this big bald guy, gets up to show the others this new helmet that he's just gotten, picks up a box off the floor, and says, what is that? He makes a face. It stinks, too. He smells his fingers. What is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:38.72" data-timestamp="38.72"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.94" data-timestamp="39.94"> It's pee. This conversation understandably turns to speculation on how the pee might have gotten there. "Where'd you find this?" he asks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:47.95" data-timestamp="47.95"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:00:48.77" data-timestamp="48.77"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:49.47" data-timestamp="49.47"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:50.29" data-timestamp="50.29"> At the depot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:51.72" data-timestamp="51.72"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:52.54" data-timestamp="52.54"> Do you think it was a cat? It was not a cat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fireman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:56.13" data-timestamp="56.13"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:57.25" data-timestamp="57.25"> The rest of the video, which is entitled "The Incident With the Helmet," goes on for a few minutes explaining why it is not a good idea to pee in your colleague's helmet, even if it's a joke. Like, that can make people feel bad, and unwelcome. And the reason the fire department needed a video like this was the firefighters were peeing in their co-workers helmets and their drinks, and had been for years.</p><p begin="00:01:24.07" data-timestamp="84.07">This was a re-enactment of an actual incident. Amsterdam firefighters had a kind of macho, frat house culture. And for women who came to work there, or anybody who wasn't white, it was rough in all kinds of ways-- pranks, bullying, racist jokes, sexist comments. Women described the environment as alienating. One Moroccan-Dutch firefighter said, "What we want is not super special. We just want normal behavior, normal treatment of people."</p><p begin="00:01:52.96" data-timestamp="112.96">The bosses had problems with them, too. The firefighters would simply ignore certain orders to change the way they worked. Back in 2011, the mayor of Amsterdam commanded them to do some straightforward things, like perform more home inspections, pass out smoke detectors, switch from 24-hour shifts to 8-hour shifts. A year passed, and another, and another. After five years-- still nothing. They'd pretty much blown off his requests.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Vughts</h4><p begin="00:02:17.97" data-timestamp="137.97"> The mayor didn't like to hear no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:21.80" data-timestamp="141.8"> Paul Vughts is a reporter at Amsterdam's biggest newspaper, <i>Het</i> <i>Parool.</i> He's covered the fire department for over 20 years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Vughts</h4><p begin="00:02:28.65" data-timestamp="148.65"> He put his fist on the table and said, "And now, it's over. And now, I'll send you a strong man. He'll change the fire brigade in the way I want it to change."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:37.71" data-timestamp="157.71"> The strong man the mayor brought in was a guy named Leen Schaap. His firefighting experience before this-- nothing. He spent his whole career working at the Amsterdam Police Department. And he wasn't just an outsider-- he was somebody with a reputation for being a real hard ass.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Vughts</h4><p begin="00:02:52.75" data-timestamp="172.75"> I expected a riot because the way they live in the fire stations, being all day and nights, they're together-- cook together, sleep together-- that makes, in the end, that outsiders don't get in easy. Here in Amsterdam, the fire stations are really like small castles in the neighborhood.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:16.87" data-timestamp="196.87"> There's 19 fire stations all around Amsterdam. There were 750 firefighters-- 500 full-time, 250 volunteer-- a brigade with the same problems as lots of brigades here in the United States. And for sure, not all firehouses are like this. But it's not hard to find examples.</p><p begin="00:03:33.85" data-timestamp="213.85">Outside of Chicago, male firefighters broke down their female co-worker's shower door while she was in there, showering. The chief handed her a towel and said, "Relax. It's firehouse fun." In Houston, women say their male co-workers peed on their beds, and when they complained, they were labeled troublemakers. The city could not substantiate those claims, but the Trump Justice Department has stepped in on the women's side. In Miami and New York, black fire department employees found nooses at work. In Michigan, a black firefighter found a banana on the windshield of his truck.</p><p begin="00:04:06.29" data-timestamp="246.29">Amsterdam is one of the rare examples of a city that really decides to take on the "boys club" culture in firehouses. And the firefighters don't lay down. They fight every step of the way. And one thing that's unusual about the guy running this department, Leen Schaap, is that he is shockingly frank about just how messed up his department really is. One of his tactics is to be utterly transparent, and show the public what he learns is happening behind the closed doors of the firehouses. He's also blunt about the pushback he gets.</p><p begin="00:04:36.08" data-timestamp="276.08">And so, unlike other fire departments and police departments with similar problems, in this case, for once, we see exactly how bad things were, laid bare. And we also see all the resistance when somebody comes in and tries to change it. We see just how hard that is to accomplish. It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:04:53.99" data-timestamp="293.99">Today on our show, we have this very unusual look inside a place like this. Reporter Joanna Kakissis has been digging into this for months. That'll be Act One of today's show. And this is such an embattled department that the only way Joanna could get most of the firefighters to talk to her was to change their names and replace their voices. So you're going to be hearing a bunch of that in what's about to follow. Basically, only Leen Schaap and one of his main opponents let us use their voices. Our producer, Miki Meek, reported this with Joanna. You'll hear Miki's voice in there, now and then, asking questions. Here's Joanna.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: A Policeman Burns Down the Firehouse</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:05:25.61" data-timestamp="325.61"> To take on a bunch of tough guys, the mayor hired someone who was used to being the toughest guy in the room. Leen Schaap climbed to the upper ranks of the Amsterdam Police Department by speaking his mind, and not caring who didn't like it. He got things done by moving quickly and aggressively. He ran the riot squad. He was known in town for forcing out anarchists squatting in a full city block of abandoned homes. Amsterdam is a progressive city, and sympathy was with the squatters. Lots of people hated Leen for what he did. They threw paint bombs at him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:05:57.95" data-timestamp="357.95"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:05:59.18" data-timestamp="359.18"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:05:59.93" data-timestamp="359.93"> Only cowardly leaders don't show up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:02.18" data-timestamp="362.18"> My interviews with him are filled with these kind of tough guy cliches.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:06:05.82" data-timestamp="365.82"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:07.31" data-timestamp="367.31"> This is a battle, and one of us is going to win it. And it's not going to be you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:11.96" data-timestamp="371.96"> Sometimes, it was hard to keep a straight face.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:06:14.25" data-timestamp="374.25"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:06:15.28" data-timestamp="375.28"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:16.52" data-timestamp="376.52"> I'm in the fire department, so I'm not really worried about getting burned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:06:20.26" data-timestamp="380.26"> OK. You're tough. You're tough.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:06:23.74" data-timestamp="383.74"> Leen smiled. He knows when he's laying it on thick. He's intense, with reddish-brown hair and blue eyes that look incredibly icy if you've pissed him off. His first week on the job, there's a welcome lunch for him. Firefighters don't show up. Then, he gets an anonymous letter telling him not to enter any fire stations. He goes anyway, and he notices right away there's nowhere for him to park. The fire station's parking spaces are filled with recreational vehicles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:06:52.63" data-timestamp="412.63"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:06:53.98" data-timestamp="413.98"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:06:55.05" data-timestamp="415.05"> Boats with caravans, with camper vans-- because basically, the firefighters were using this area around the firehouse as their private space, saying, we're here 24 hours.

If not, I'm going to hire somebody to take all that stuff away. And they were like, oh, go ahead. And I took a step forward, and stood my ground. You know, I threatened to take a police crane and lift it out of there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:07:59.43" data-timestamp="479.43"> Firefighters were furious, and thought Leen was acting too much like an uptight cop. But everyone complied. They got rid of their boats and campers. Except for one guy, who ignored Leen and defiantly brought a boat right back-- the only boat in the parking lot. Leen put him on probation and moved him to another firehouse. It was one of his first disciplinary actions. The guy retaliated by not coming to work, and taking the department to court.</p><p begin="00:08:30.02" data-timestamp="510.02">Leen was figuring things out pretty fast. He estimated there were about 50 of these guys in the entire department-- guys who joined the brigade decades ago, and now ran their fire stations. They kept tabs on their bosses through a private Whatsapp channel. Some firefighters called them "The Brotherhood." Leen always called them--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:08:48.77" data-timestamp="528.77"> The angry white men.

In Dutch, this is a racial slur.

I can't lead this life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:10:42.96" data-timestamp="642.96"> Leen fired him. It was the first time racism had been cited as a reason to fire someone from the Amsterdam Fire Department. So he'd gotten rid of the boats, he'd fired a guy for racism-- progress. But The Brotherhood started a petition for the firefighter to get his job back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:10:58.83" data-timestamp="658.83"> How did you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:11:01.42" data-timestamp="661.42"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:11:03.00" data-timestamp="663"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:11:03.91" data-timestamp="663.91"> It really opened my eyes. Instead of uniting around the people who were discriminated against, they united against the person who was discriminating, and they formed a block around him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:11:15.60" data-timestamp="675.6"> The problem ran so much deeper than Leen thought. Why wouldn't they want to stick up for the guy getting harassed? For Leen, it was obvious. He instinctively sided with the firefighter getting picked on, and he didn't understand anyone who didn't. That empathy for the outsider-- it made Leen an unusual commander. So he started investigating to figure out just how bad things were.</p><p begin="00:11:38.64" data-timestamp="698.64">The numbers were not encouraging. When Leen started, there were only five female firefighters on the entire full-time force of 500. The fire department is not allowed to record race, but he estimates that only around 10% of the force were people of color. These numbers didn't reflect the city at all. At least a third of Amsterdam's population is non-white.</p><p begin="00:11:59.58" data-timestamp="719.58">Leen visited the fire stations, and talked to firefighters over coffee at the long lunch tables there. And he learned that lots of them liked the changes he was bringing in. He had a silent band of support. He asked people about their experiences in the department, and to his surprise, people opened up to him. Through their stories, he started to get a sense of what it was like to be a person of color or a woman in his fire department.</p><p begin="00:12:22.95" data-timestamp="742.95">Moroccan and Surinamese-Dutch firefighters said they were called rats and monkeys. The Brotherhood told some they didn't belong-- that firefighters should be Dutch, and white. One Muslim firefighter I'm calling Ali told me that over time, he learned to go along with the racial slurs. So when his co-workers called him "bin Laden," he acted like he wasn't upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali</h4><p begin="00:12:44.01" data-timestamp="764.01"> You have to ignore it. If they find out that you don't like it, they'll keep on coming back, and back, and back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:12:51.25" data-timestamp="771.25"> Have you ever reported discrimination in the past?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ali</h4><p begin="00:12:55.14" data-timestamp="775.14"> It wasn't possible to do that. Nobody does that. You could report whatever you want, but nothing was going to happen. In the worst of cases, when it really got out of hand, what you would just do is shake hands on it and get it over. The one accused-- he'll just say, come on, man. It was a joke. And nothing's going to happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:13:13.05" data-timestamp="793.05"> Leen hired a consultant to help him reach out to women who'd quit the department. They felt like they never belonged. They said harassment and belittlement happened every hour of the day. One woman said men in her station asked her to leave the room so they could comment on her ass. Men told women to sit in the windows of the firehouse as if they were prostitutes in the red light district. During job interviews, women were asked how they do their jobs on their periods.</p><p begin="00:13:38.49" data-timestamp="818.49">One of the few female officers in the Amsterdam Fire Department is a woman I'm calling Judy. The guys respected her. She was strong, physically, and she was tough-- had no problem standing up to these guys. But even she felt like she was constantly being tested, like when a firefighter under her command purposely opened his towel in front of her. When she suggested that her boss has not put women into fire stations alone, but with other women, one of her superiors called her a "highly educated moaning female."</p><p begin="00:14:09.57" data-timestamp="849.57">One night, she was doing her rounds, checking in on everyone, and stopped by the canteen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:14:15.01" data-timestamp="855.01"> I was saying good night to everybody. And then, they were sitting and watching porn.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:14:21.44" data-timestamp="861.44"> Didn't you say something then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:14:23.64" data-timestamp="863.64"> No. So I didn't say anything about that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:14:28.35" data-timestamp="868.35"> Porn was a regular thing in the common areas of lots of the stations.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:14:32.46" data-timestamp="872.46"> I don't know why I didn't say anything. I didn't feel comfortable to say it, probably. It's also me being influenced by The Brotherhood, I think. Because saying something-- it's always uncomfortable to say that. So yeah, I have to admit that I've avoided it, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:14:54.12" data-timestamp="894.12"> Everyone's grip on what was normal was out of whack. Judy remembers a woman at a fire station who had this particular bedtime ritual.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:15:01.56" data-timestamp="901.56"> So she would go to bed, and somebody would come to tuck her in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:15:05.94" data-timestamp="905.94"> Wait. They tucked her into bed at night?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:09.66" data-timestamp="909.66"> What exactly do you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:15:10.56" data-timestamp="910.56"> Oh, tucking in-- it was like when you put your little one to sleep, and you pull your blankets tight around the person. So the guy who would do that said, I'm going to tuck her in. And I felt uncomfortable about that for her. I mean, it was her choice. But I would never do that, because it makes a certain situation that I think you should avoid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:15:32.13" data-timestamp="932.13"> She was fine with it? She didn't mind this happening?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:15:37.06" data-timestamp="937.06"> Well, actually, I don't know. I can't remember ever talking to her about that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:15:43.63" data-timestamp="943.63"> Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Judy</h4><p begin="00:15:45.47" data-timestamp="945.47"> Yeah. That's a good question. Maybe I might be putting her more in danger. Or I might not be helping her. Or maybe I was telling myself, well, maybe it's her choice, and she likes it or something. But yeah, I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:16:11.56" data-timestamp="971.56"> Hearing all these stories, Leen realized he had to spell things out-- what is normal behavior in a workplace. He wrote a manifesto on how to behave like a professional firefighter and sent it out to everyone. It begins, "All of us are going to act normal."</p><p begin="00:16:27.13" data-timestamp="987.13">"Normal" meant, we don't yell at each other. We don't steal coffee from the firehouses. We don't make offensive comments on social media. We always wear our uniforms. We don't store our personal tanning beds in the women's dormitories if we're men. If you break the rules, you'll be punished. And if you no longer know what "normal" is, please find out.</p><p begin="00:16:51.20" data-timestamp="1011.2">One of the biggest ways firefighting is not like a normal job-- firefighters work 24-hour shifts. So everyone lives together. They work out, shop for groceries, cook, watch TV, play soccer, sleep. Professional boundaries get blurry. Leen wanted to push the department to 8-hour shifts. It would make fire stations more like a workplace, and less like a private club.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:17:12.95" data-timestamp="1032.95"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:17:14.45" data-timestamp="1034.45"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:17:16.49" data-timestamp="1036.49"> I think the fire department-- many of the firefighters will fight almost literally to the death to defend this 24-hour shift.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:17:24.80" data-timestamp="1044.8"> Firefighters liked being together for 24 hours, and hanging out, and then getting a couple days off to spend with their families, or hold down second jobs. And The Brotherhood argued that bonding in the fire station is essential. The pushback was so strong that Leen managed to open just one firehouse on 8-hour shifts as an experiment. The Brotherhood pressured firefighters not to transfer there.</p><p begin="00:17:54.86" data-timestamp="1074.86">The guys in The Brotherhood are afraid to talk to reporters. Everyone I reached out to was worried he'd lose his job. But I did get four of them to speak to me on condition that I not use their names. I'll call this one Jan. He did let me use his real voice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:18:09.07" data-timestamp="1089.07"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:18:09.98" data-timestamp="1089.98"> He said the problem in the department wasn't them.

And I didn't feel embarrassed about it at that moment. But--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:18:24.00" data-timestamp="1104"> The women would tuck you into bed?

Yeah. There are jokes sometimes, you know? I also went to bed, and I stepped in my bed. And somebody else came from the shower, and he was already, before me, in my bed. So these kind of things happen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:18:41.77" data-timestamp="1121.77"> But if you're a woman, and somebody is tucking you into bed, it's a different experience. And it's--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan</h4><p begin="00:18:48.83" data-timestamp="1128.83"> Tucking is not something that they want to shock you, or they want to embarrass you, or they--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:18:54.77" data-timestamp="1134.77"> Yeah.

It's so stupid if I say all the time "it doesn't happen," or "that doesn't happen." It probably happened with one female employee. And probably one female employee left, also. Do you have to say, then, OK, this is a sexist company, or all the females are bullied, or all the Arabic people are bullied? I don't think so.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:19:29.66" data-timestamp="1169.66"> I asked him about the firefighter Leen fired-- the one who called the Muslim neighborhood in Amsterdam "the caliphate," and used racial slurs on his Moroccan-Dutch co-workers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan</h4><p begin="00:19:38.26" data-timestamp="1178.26"> He's not a racist.

And this is not happening right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:21:15.81" data-timestamp="1275.81"> This is what Leen says he was up against-- a group of men for whom "normal" meant keeping things exactly the way they'd always been.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:21:28.37" data-timestamp="1288.37"> I was just wondering-- doesn't a boss have the right to impose boundaries on workplaces?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jan</h4><p begin="00:21:34.11" data-timestamp="1294.11"> We are not in this business for him.

It's a way of life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:21:53.69" data-timestamp="1313.69"> Leen's approach to making big institutional change is based on a progressive fairly new management theory, designed to curb lawless organizations. It's essentially-- draw hard boundaries. Make no concessions. Be consistent, unrelenting. And in 10 to 15 years, maybe there'll be a real shift. It's arduous. The beginning is the hardest part.</p><p begin="00:22:15.99" data-timestamp="1335.99">This approach made a lot of sense to Leen because of his experience on the Amsterdam Police Force. He helped clean up and reform the department. As a rookie cop, he'd seen the problems firsthand. He started in a corrupt precinct, the red light district in the 1980s. He says cops stole, sold drugs, were excessively violent. Changing that meant rigorously enforcing rules, writing up bad cops, disciplining them, firing them. Leen says it took about 10 years for the rules to be accepted as normal. But this confrontational approach is not the way things usually work in the Netherlands.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:22:53.59" data-timestamp="1373.59"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:22:54.42" data-timestamp="1374.42"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:22:54.99" data-timestamp="1374.99"> You know, the Dutch culture is very much everything peace, everything together, no conflict.

They take pride in it. The idea is to bring everyone together, despite their differences, just like their ancestors came together to build dikes and dams to protect their land from the sea. Historians debate whether that's actually true. But anyway, everyone from Parliament to the local amateur soccer club tries to make decisions this way-- through discussions and consensus.</p><p begin="00:23:30.89" data-timestamp="1410.89">Leen did dabble with polder model a little in the beginning. He spent his first six months going to fire stations, trying to convince people that diversity would make them a stronger fire department in a city with almost 170 nationalities, and that women bring pragmatism and emotional intelligence to the brigade. But Leen was almost always met with blank stares. Guys told him, women aren't strong enough for this job. One of them said, you just want an excuse to bring in a hundred broads.

Today's show, "Burn It Down"-- we have two stories of people who think they have no other choice. It is time to burn everything down, make enemies, do what has to be done. We're in the middle of Act One. A policeman burns down a firehouse. Joanna Kakissis, in this act, is reporting on the Amsterdam Fire Department, the resistance to change from inside the department, and, in this half of her story, how the bigger politics of the city start to shift everything.</p><p begin="00:25:49.47" data-timestamp="1549.47">Quick program note before we start the second half of this. Joanna discovered, when she started looking into this story, that the fire commander's partner, who is a journalist, is somebody who Joanna has worked with in the past. Joanna has not discussed the content of the story with this journalist. The journalist was not involved in this story in any way. Again, here's Joanna.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:26:07.47" data-timestamp="1567.47"> Leen had devised a very unusual plan. But to pull it off, he had to enlist the mayor. He did something that I've rarely seen any public official do-- he took all his criticisms about his own fire department and made them public. And by doing so, he made himself the biggest critic of some of the most beloved figures in Amsterdam.</p><p begin="00:26:27.09" data-timestamp="1587.09">Imagine the head of the police department in New York or Chicago publishing a long list of all the bad stuff their officers had done.

City council members said they were shocked. The mayor told Leen to keep pushing on with his reforms. But inside the firehouses, Leen's tactics did not go over well. His support shrunk. Even people who agreed with his goals, who thought he was fighting the good fight, felt like he was smearing everyone, lumping them together, making them all look bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Firefighter</h4><p begin="00:31:04.93" data-timestamp="1864.93"> The way that he did that-- he turned every firefighter against him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:31:09.02" data-timestamp="1869.02"> This is a longtime firefighter of color in the brigade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Firefighter</h4><p begin="00:31:11.98" data-timestamp="1871.98"> Leen and the mayor went about it really radically. They used the newspapers to try to turn public opinion against us.

It was a public declaration of war. On social media, firefighters called Leen and the mayor "know-it-all political losers" and "vile," "full of lies." They wrote, "Indict this mayor and have him sued for defamation," and, "Thanks, Leen, we're all painted like a bunch of racists."</p><p begin="00:31:52.45" data-timestamp="1912.45">Inside the firehouses, the atmosphere changed.

And now, for the first time, you see that people, for instance, won't shake your hand. There's this tradition. After we put out a fire, we always sit on the side. We have a coffee, and all the firemen shake each other's hands. That's really a tradition. And now, for the first time since I've been here, white firefighters are refusing to shake our hands.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joanna Kakissis</h4><p begin="00:32:32.61" data-timestamp="1952.61"> Meanwhile, Leen got more done than ever. He doubled down on recruitment, went to mosques and dinners during Ramadan, tried to convince more people of color and women to join the fire brigade. Slowly, those numbers have increased. He also backed managers who disciplined bad actors. He streamlined work shifts, opened a new firehouse, and improved fire prevention. He made homes safer by sending firefighters door-to-door in the city.</p><p begin="00:32:57.24" data-timestamp="1977.24">Leen, with the backing of the mayor, was making the kinds of changes he was hired to make, in exactly the way he wanted to make them-- quickly and aggressively. But then, something happened that Leen hadn't accounted for. Six months into his job, Mayor Eberhard van der Laan revealed he was sick-- lung cancer. A half year later, he died. Immediately, the ground started to shift under Leen. When the mayor died, The Brotherhood grew emboldened. Here's Leen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:33:27.99" data-timestamp="2007.99"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:33:28.94" data-timestamp="2008.94"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:33:32.24" data-timestamp="2012.24"> People commented that it was great that he died.

Retired firefighters and unions rallied around The Brotherhood, publicly demanding that the city investigate Leen for bad mouthing the fire department in the media. Firefighters did interviews anonymously, denouncing Leen in a conservative newspaper, the biggest paper in the Netherlands. From the moment the mayor announced he was sick, Leen started getting anonymous death threats. One letter said a hitman was being hired. Another targeted his 14-year-old daughter. He was told the threats were coming from inside the fire department.</p><p begin="00:34:36.46" data-timestamp="2076.46">In the summer of 2018, Amsterdam got an energetic new mayor, the first woman in the city's history-- Femke Halsema. She was Leen's new boss, and spent many years in parliament as a high-profile lawmaker representing the left-wing Green Party, a champion of women's rights. As a politician, she pushed for tax breaks to address poverty. She also wrote newspaper columns, and made a documentary about Muslim women.</p><p begin="00:35:02.01" data-timestamp="2102.01">Mayor Halsema condemned the death threats against Leen, and publicly threw her support behind him. But not long after she started, Leen remembers her stopping by for a private meeting. He told her about some of the changes he was trying to make. Her reaction shocked him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:35:16.45" data-timestamp="2116.45"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:35:17.60" data-timestamp="2117.6"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:35:18.54" data-timestamp="2118.54"> When we were having this conversation about racism and discrimination, the mayor herself came with the following example.

She said she's only told the joke in meetings as an example of, quote, "intolerable behavior that's not always recognized as such by firefighters." For Leen, that moment crystallized the world of difference between his old and new boss. After that, he gave up on her.</p><p begin="00:37:11.93" data-timestamp="2231.93">Mayor Halsema had, like the rest of Amsterdam, seen Leen's fight with the firefighters play out in the media, and she didn't like it. She liked talking up problems and reaching consensus-- the Dutch way. Fire department managers who sat in on meetings with the new mayor and Leen said it was clear right away that they didn't get along-- that sometimes, he was abrasive. Their styles were totally different. They called the mayor "Tai Chi," and Leen "Boxing."</p><p begin="00:37:38.78" data-timestamp="2258.78">The mayor ordered her own investigation into the fire department. The new investigation acknowledged there were problems, but it concluded that overall, the fire department was, quote, "at its core not a racist or sexist organization," and it called on Leen to take a different approach, and build trust with firefighters. A city hall reporter told me this report basically threw Leen under the bus. When it came out at the end of 2018, Leen had been on the job for about two and a half years. I spoke to him around this time. He seemed unfazed by the report. He was still going about the business of reforming the fire department, and airing its dirty laundry, like this problem firefighter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leen Schaap</h4><p begin="00:38:19.17" data-timestamp="2299.17"> [SPEAKING DUTCH]</p><p begin="00:38:20.86" data-timestamp="2300.86"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:38:21.53" data-timestamp="2301.53"> He's not fired yet, but I'm going to fire him.
