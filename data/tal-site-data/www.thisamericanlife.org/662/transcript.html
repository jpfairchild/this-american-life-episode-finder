<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.53" data-timestamp="0.53"> My friend Etgar, his mom does not take no for an answer. Etgar's Israeli. Etgar Keret, we run his short stories here on the radio show now and then.</p><p begin="00:00:09.48" data-timestamp="9.48">Anyway, years ago, Etgar's older brother was in the army serving in Lebanon. Israel had just invaded Lebanon. It was war.</p><p begin="00:00:16.43" data-timestamp="16.43">And it sounds incredible to us, but the policy of the Israeli army is that if it's at all possible, you go home on leave every two weeks. And Lebanon's close, just next door to Israel. Etgar says his brother was coming home every month. And then that stopped. He wasn't getting any leave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:00:34.91" data-timestamp="34.91"> And my brother didn't come home for almost two months, and it drove my mother crazy. And she decided that she should get my brother back home. And it's very difficult to deal with anything during the war, because everybody is hysterical and crazy.</p><p begin="00:00:53.99" data-timestamp="53.99">But she decided that she needs to speak to the chief of staff. And she started calling--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:00.41" data-timestamp="60.41"> And the chief of staff is the head of the army?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:01:03.44" data-timestamp="63.44"> Yeah, it's like the head general.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:07.40" data-timestamp="67.4"> For the entire army?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:01:09.32" data-timestamp="69.32"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:10.66" data-timestamp="70.66"> Etgar explained her strategy was simple. She'd call the guy's office, talk to whoever answered.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:01:15.62" data-timestamp="75.62"> And she would talk for long enough until she would have something that she could say offended her or made her angry. And then she asked to speak with that person's superior.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:27.56" data-timestamp="87.56"> She did the same thing with that person and then that person's superior.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:01:30.68" data-timestamp="90.68"> And so on and on and on and on. And in the end, she found herself speaking to the head general, Rafael Eitan, who is one of Israel's most famous kind of war heroes.</p><p begin="00:01:43.57" data-timestamp="103.57">And she said to him, listen, General Eitan, I know that you're fighting a war. And I really don't want to waste any of your time, so I will make it simple. My son didn't get a leave from the army for the past two months.</p><p begin="00:01:55.46" data-timestamp="115.46">I give you 24 hours to send him back home. If you know what's good for you, he'll be back before tomorrow evening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:04.25" data-timestamp="124.25"> Wait, if you know what's good for you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:02:06.83" data-timestamp="126.83"> Yeah. And the guy says to her, I just want to understand, Mrs. Keret. Are you threatening me? And she says, yes, I am. I'm threatening you. And I didn't want to put it in the subtext, because I know that you're busy. So if you know what's good for you, you'll send my son back home.</p><p begin="00:02:26.70" data-timestamp="146.7">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:02:27.64" data-timestamp="147.64"></p><p begin="00:02:33.75" data-timestamp="153.75">And he says to her, Mrs. Keret, do you know who I am? And she said, yeah, you're Rafael Eitan, the war hero. And he said to her, if you know anything about me, then you know that I'm not easily scared.</p><p begin="00:02:47.46" data-timestamp="167.46">So my mother said, yeah, but I don't think you had many chance to fight with elderly Holocaust survivors, who are 5 foot tall and weigh 82 pounds. And I want to tell you something, and I'll make it very simple and very quick. After you quit the army, you either go to politics or you go to the free market.</p><p begin="00:03:08.55" data-timestamp="188.55">In both cases, you're going to be very exposed. In both cases, every time, there'll be a TV camera around or journalist. You'll have this elderly lady sitting in the first row, shouting at you, accusing you of any bad things that you might have made and maybe of some bad things that you've never made. Because I'm a very good liar. And you really don't want that. And at that stage, he hung up the phone in her face.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:35.58" data-timestamp="215.58"> The next afternoon, Etgar's brother arrived home. So they pulled him out of his ranks, told him to get on a helicopter. He had no idea what was going on, nor did anybody else.</p><p begin="00:03:45.93" data-timestamp="225.93">He assumed some family member died or something, Etgar says. And he got his break.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:03:51.24" data-timestamp="231.24"> He came and took a shower, slept for 16 hours. My mother saw that he was OK. And a day after that, he went back to Lebanon.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:04.99" data-timestamp="244.99"> I should say, we cannot confirm the details of this story, including the dialogue between Etgar's mom and Rafael Eitan. This happened over 30 years ago. Eitan's dead. When we got Etgar's mom, she said, sure, whatever Etgar says.</p><p begin="00:04:18.01" data-timestamp="258.01">But there are many stories of Etgar's mom doing things like this. There was a time she threatened a mugger so effectively that he abandoned the idea of mugging her in the middle of the mugging. There was a showdown with the president of Poland that ended when the president of Poland finally gave her the passport she demanded, as somebody who had been born in Poland.</p><p begin="00:04:36.90" data-timestamp="276.9">Etgar is the same way in certain situations. He doesn't threaten. That's not who he is. He just reasons people to death.</p><p begin="00:04:45.61" data-timestamp="285.61">Case in point, a couple of years ago, he and his wife Shira and their then 8-year-old son, Lev, were traveling, and they left a backpack on an airplane. In the backpack was Etgar's iPad, which had all of his son's games on it.</p><p begin="00:04:58.37" data-timestamp="298.37">Lev had spent months on his games working his way up the levels of the games. Now, that was gone. Lev was really messed up about it. Any parent knows what I'm talking about.</p><p begin="00:05:06.13" data-timestamp="306.13">And they called the airline. The airline says, no problem. When you get to the airport for the return flight, go to lost and found. It'll be there.</p><p begin="00:05:13.72" data-timestamp="313.72">So comes the day. They're on their way home. They get to the airport. This is in Rome. They can't find the lost and found. Time is getting short. They've got a plane to catch.</p><p begin="00:05:22.51" data-timestamp="322.51">Finally, a guy at the car rental-- super nice guy-- offers to take them to it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:05:27.28" data-timestamp="327.28"> His name was Massimo. And he took us to the lost and found place, where there was this really, really nasty woman. And I said to her, you know you have our bag. And we're supposed to take it, and we're going to fly really soon.</p><p begin="00:05:40.03" data-timestamp="340.03">I said to her, I can actually see it. And I pointed to the bag, because it was behind her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:45.05" data-timestamp="345.05"> She says to Etgar, she needs a letter from the airline saying he was on the same flight as the backpack. Etgar doesn't have this letter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:05:52.17" data-timestamp="352.17"> She said, sir, I'm not going to give you the bag without the letter. I'm sorry. And I said to her, but I go to Israel. I never get to see the bag. And she said, you know, that's your problem.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:02.42" data-timestamp="362.42"> As somebody who knows Etgar, I'll just say, wrong move. Something deep and powerful kicks in inside him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:06:08.52" data-timestamp="368.52"> My wife said to me, OK, let's go, so we won't miss the flight. I said, no, just a moment. And I said to the woman, look, don't give me the bag, but just do this kind of thing.</p><p begin="00:06:15.99" data-timestamp="375.99">Please, unzip the outside pocket of it, and see if there are crackers in it with a Hebrew writing on the package of crackers. And she said, why would you want to do that? I said to her, I just ask you to please do it.</p><p begin="00:06:29.29" data-timestamp="389.29">And she went and said, yeah, there are crackers in it. So I said to her, so we both agree that this is my bag? She says, yeah, this is your bag. So I said to her, so would you please give it to me?</p><p begin="00:06:37.75" data-timestamp="397.75">She said, no, sir, I won't give it to you, unless you give me this letter. And I said to her, but you understand that my son is here, and his game is here. Are you a parent? And she said, yes, I'm a parent.</p><p begin="00:06:48.72" data-timestamp="408.72">And I said to her, so think about it. If your son had a game he really wanted to win, you had to go and confront with the person who said, yeah, I know this game is yours. But your son is never going to get it just because of some kind of technicality. You're Italian. Be Italian. Be warm, be nice, be like in a Fellini movie. Give me the bag.</p><p begin="00:07:08.43" data-timestamp="428.43">And she said, no, sir. I'm not going to give you the bag, and you're wasting your time. You better go to your flight, because you're going to miss your flight. And Shira said, let's go. She isn't going to give it to you.</p><p begin="00:07:16.98" data-timestamp="436.98">And I said to her, but don't you understand, as a human being, there will be one day when you die, and you look back at your life, and you think about this day.

He'd invite members from both parties to poker nights in DC. He was in Congress for decades and by the time he was Speaker, he was a living legend type.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ronald Reagan</h4><p begin="00:12:19.41" data-timestamp="739.41"> We got along.

He said, after 6 o'clock, we're buddies. We're friends.

We've always had two parties. But we didn't always have two teams like we do now.</p><p begin="00:14:15.03" data-timestamp="855.03">Red versus blue, us versus them. Each side routinely demonizes the other side as un-American. You sign up for one issue-- the wall, the Mueller investigation, Colin Kaepernick, climate change-- you basically sign up for all of them.</p><p begin="00:14:28.13" data-timestamp="868.13">It wasn't always so zero sum like it's become. You could explain what happened in different ways. But I'm going to argue it was the work of these two guys that got us to this point, two guys, one quarterbacking the other.</p><p begin="00:14:41.10" data-timestamp="881.1">And so without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, the first of the two men who created the modern world.

People close to him say he always pictured himself as a historical figure, someone who would bend the course of American history, someone who anticipated stories like the one I'm telling you now. From his teenage years, he thought this way.</p><p begin="00:15:28.54" data-timestamp="928.54">He ran for Congress twice in West Georgia, lost, and then finally won a seat in the House in 1978 with a 1778 attitude, like there was a revolution on, and the country's very existence was at stake. We're fighting a war, Gingrich said back then, a war for power. Raise hell. Raise hell all the time.</p><p begin="00:15:48.16" data-timestamp="948.16">His goal was to retake the House of Representatives. At the time, an impossible dream. Republicans had been in the minority for 24 years. People called it the permanent Democratic Congress.</p><p begin="00:16:00.67" data-timestamp="960.67">Once Newt finally got there, he discovered, as he'd suspected, was a place full of losers with Stockholm syndrome. It was chummy, mostly guys in suits and ties, smoking cigars, playing poker together and generally, getting along, hanging out, talking to each other. Also, depending on your perspective, it was a corrupt cesspool of bribes and giveaways. That's definitely how Gingrich saw it.</p><p begin="00:16:25.81" data-timestamp="985.81">Republicans didn't have much power, but they'd go along to get along and occasionally do some deals. And most of them had stopped imagining it could be any other way. I learned most of this story from the great political reporter Steve Kornacki. He'd just published a book about this time called <i>The</i> <i>Red</i> <i>and</i> <i>The</i> <i>Blue:</i> <i>The</i> <i>1990s</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>Birth</i> <i>of</i> <i>Political</i> <i>Tribalism.</i> He's also that excited guy at the big board on MSNBC during elections.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:16:50.98" data-timestamp="1010.98">He explained that Newt arrived in Congress determined to turn the place upside down. Newt didn't want everyone getting along. Republicans were never going to take the majority that way. He wanted to fight, and the weapon he used was the media.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Kornacki</h4><p begin="00:17:04.25" data-timestamp="1024.25"> His arrival in the House coincides with a historic moment in the house, and that is the first television camera is placed in the chamber in 1979-- his first year there. And its C-Span.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:17:14.86" data-timestamp="1034.86"> C-Span may not sound exciting to you, but A, it's still awesome. And B, it's a major change. Now anyone can see for themselves what's going on in Congress if they want to. And people in Congress can speak to anyone on the outside.</p><p begin="00:17:28.51" data-timestamp="1048.51">Newt gets it right away. The rest of the House does not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Kornacki</h4><p begin="00:17:31.72" data-timestamp="1051.72"> There's a lot of opposition to it, because this is a club here. But once the camera's there, most members, they just kind of ignore it. And they leave at the end of the business day. And they go and they do whatever it is they do after business hours.</p><p begin="00:17:43.87" data-timestamp="1063.87">To Newt Gingrich, here it is. I want people to notice this around the country. I got an audience now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:17:50.92" data-timestamp="1070.92"> Yeah, it's Twitter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tip O'neill</h4><p begin="00:17:52.63" data-timestamp="1072.63"> The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Gingrich, is recognized for 60 minutes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newt Gingrich</h4><p begin="00:18:00.37" data-timestamp="1080.37"> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

It's endemic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Kornacki</h4><p begin="00:18:19.40" data-timestamp="1099.4"> And he starts claiming there's this rule in the house that at the close of business and any day, any member can claim the floor for any reason they want for pretty much any amount of time they want. And it's called special orders. And Gingrich starts claiming these special order speeches that were 10 o'clock at night, 11 o'clock at night.</p><p begin="00:18:38.27" data-timestamp="1118.27">It's an empty chamber. His colleagues are asleep. They're drinking. They're not there. They're not listening to this. They're never even going to hear about this-- most of them. But Gingrich knows there are people all across America, who've got these new cable boxes in their house, who are scanning the dial and seeing what's out there.</p><p begin="00:18:54.61" data-timestamp="1134.61">And some of them are going to pause when they see him. And what they're hearing is he's not giving a dry speech about and now, if I can direct your attention to subsection 3 of the agriculture funding-- he's giving these grand speeches about American politics, and an American identity, and the corrupt Democrat machine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:19:12.55" data-timestamp="1152.55"> Often Gingrich or one of his few allies was explaining how the Democrats were fringy, communist radicals. The whole party, everyone in the party was, more or less, a socialist. It was sort of his version of all Democrats want open borders, but less punchy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newt Gingrich</h4><p begin="00:19:29.32" data-timestamp="1169.32"> Since communism doesn't strike them as an independent, inexorable force, feeding on totalitarian personalities and concepts, McGovern Democrats don't fear it. Trash America, indict the president, and give the benefit of every doubt to Marxist regimes. That's the standard formula.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Kornacki</h4><p begin="00:19:44.26" data-timestamp="1184.26"> He is producing what you would now recognize as a cable news show on the floor of the House. And he's performing for the camera, and he's giving his monologue. He's giving his monologue on the decay of the Democratic Party, the decay of American culture, the promise of a Republican Party that embraces opportunity and responsibility, and all these things.</p><p begin="00:20:02.49" data-timestamp="1202.49">And there is an audience that starts to tune in. And he knows it. He gets that. He gets the potential of that before anybody else.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:20:11.50" data-timestamp="1211.5"> Newt believed there was a Republican majority out there. Because just a decade earlier, Richard Nixon had trounced the Democratic candidate for president. He won 49 out of the 50 states. Clearly, there was an appetite for Republican rule.</p><p begin="00:20:24.88" data-timestamp="1224.88">But Republicans were still a minority in the House. People somehow weren't syncing up their Republican votes into one Republican ticket. What he needed to do was paint all the Democrats more clearly as the enemy to the voters. And he'd do that by associating all of them with a candidate who'd lost to Nixon-- George McGovern.</p><p begin="00:20:44.56" data-timestamp="1244.56">George McGovern was sort of the Bernie Sanders of his day. So lefty, he even freaked out a lot of Democrats in '72-- the counterculture, anti-war candidate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Kornacki</h4><p begin="00:20:53.29" data-timestamp="1253.29"> If Republicans were able in 1972 to score that epic of a landslide running against the Democratic Party of George McGovern and the activists behind him, Newt Gingrich believed that's the key to the Republican Party winning everything. If you nationalize politics, and you make voters everywhere in the country see in whatever Democrat it is in their backyard, who's running for whatever office it is-- Congress, or Sheriff, or state legislature, or dog catcher-- if you get the voters to see that Democrat as no different from George McGovern and the folks around him, well, you know how those voters are going to react.</p><p begin="00:21:29.84" data-timestamp="1289.84">They're going to go, and they're going to vote Republican. And so his idea was to make voters across the country judge politics based on what they saw coming out of Washington, based on what they saw coming out of the national media.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:21:40.93" data-timestamp="1300.93"> Based on what they saw on C-Span, where over and over again, Newt brought up McGovern.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newt Gingrich</h4><p begin="00:21:45.61" data-timestamp="1305.61"> In the late '60s and early '70s, it became a truism with the entire American left from bomb throwers in Chicago, to eastern writers, to progressive, pinstriped supporters of Eugene McCarthy and McGovern.

You remember the Speaker, the affable Muppet, Tip O'Neill. Newt Gingrich and a couple of the other guys, Gingrich acolytes, are talking smack about specific congressmen. They're questioning their patriotism on the public record, and they aren't even there to respond.</p><p begin="00:22:34.00" data-timestamp="1354">That was not done. It was against the gentlemanly code of the House. As Speaker, Tip O'Neill controls the cameras. And he orders them to pan out and show the empty room that Gingrich and his buddies are addressing.</p><p begin="00:22:47.56" data-timestamp="1367.56">Bob Walker, Republican from Pennsylvania, happens to be speaking right then. And he takes great umbrage when this happens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Walker</h4><p begin="00:22:54.29" data-timestamp="1374.29"> But I do want to take a note of something that's evidently happening right now, which is a change of procedure here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:23:04.78" data-timestamp="1384.78"> Tip O'Neill thinks this will make the guys look petty talking to no one. Watching it, it's like a surreal Beckett play. A tiny man at the bottom of the screen gestures wildly from a podium as though he's speaking to a big crowd, but he's surrounded by empty chairs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Newt Gingrich</h4><p begin="00:23:19.54" data-timestamp="1399.54"> It is my understanding that as I deliver this special order this evening, the cameras are panning this chamber, demonstrating that there is no one here in the chamber to listen to these remarks. That is evidently the work of a change in the pattern of rules around here. It is one more example of how this body is run, the kind of arrogance of power that the members are given that kind of change with absolutely no warning.</p><p begin="00:23:47.26" data-timestamp="1427.26">I see the gentleman from California, Mr. Coelho, was standing in the back of the chamber just a moment ago. Mr. Coelho has talked in recent weeks about shutting off these special orders and not allowing them to even be seen in the countryside. And he stands in the back of the chamber now smiling.</p><p begin="00:24:04.18" data-timestamp="1444.18">I have to feel that perhaps he is getting worried that some of the things that are being said in this chamber in these special orders are, in fact, influencing people out across the country to think that this body is something less than what the American people think it ought to be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:24:20.62" data-timestamp="1460.62"> Lots of C-Span watchers today understand the congressmen are putting on a performance.

The Speaker of the House basically promotes Gingrich's late night program. Then the Speaker gets called out in front of the whole country, and he looks arrogant and mean.

He reads a story in the <i>Washington</i> <i>Post</i> about the new Speaker getting $0.50 on the dollar for every one of his books he's selling.

It felt idealistic for everyone sick of being pushed around in the minority.</p><p begin="00:29:12.79" data-timestamp="1752.79">Gingrich promised a new system that was less corrupt, more transparent, more accountable to the voters, not just like we're putting on a play that we're two parties.

Obviously, the opposite is true.</p><p begin="00:31:41.20" data-timestamp="1901.2">Republicans in Congress are galvanized by Wright's fall and Newt's tactics to get him out. The wars that Gingrich dreamed of are starting to materialize.

It's basically a candidate training organization and fundraising tool.

The Republicans keep winning these big presidential victories, but the House is stuck with that permanent Republican minority.

They live lives of privilege you can't imagine. They lord it over you. They don't have to worry about the things you worry about. It touched all of those nerves. Gingrich got it immediately.

He did have a policy vision. He got people to unite under it. Going into the 1994 midterm elections, hundreds of Republican candidates signed on to this thing-- the Contract with America. For a moment, they were all literally on the same page with Newt Gingrich.</p><p begin="00:39:04.21" data-timestamp="2344.21">The contract promised to fix everything they thought had gone wrong after 40 years of one-party control of the House. There were anti-corruption measures targeted at the Congress itself, plus a slate of 10 proposals to balance the budget, cut welfare, do tougher sentencing, lower taxes, basically, a limited government, law-and-order agenda. They ran the contract in full in an ad in <i>TV</i> <i>Guide,</i> because everyone read <i>TV</i> <i>Guide,</i> and they'd open it up several times a week.</p><p begin="00:39:32.12" data-timestamp="2372.12">And with that, Newt Gingrich, of course, got his majority, like he'd always dreamed, and became Speaker of the House in 1995.

It was the mainstream media, what he called the liberal media.</p><p begin="00:41:25.06" data-timestamp="2485.06">It was a new day in Congress. The Speaker and the president-- Gingrich and Clinton-- they did not hang out. The politics that follow are personal and vicious, as I'm sure you know.

<h3>Act Two: Life Is a Coin With One Side</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:25.62" data-timestamp="2725.62"> Act Two, Life is a one-sided coin.</p><p begin="00:45:29.51" data-timestamp="2729.51">So the entire premise of our show today is where there's a will, which presupposes that we all have a will. That we all have the ability to decide something and take action in the world. But it turns out that there are people who take issue with that premise. And one of them is one of our co-workers here at the radio show, David Kestenbaum. He now presents This Minority Report.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:45:48.90" data-timestamp="2748.9"> Let me say upfront, I realize the ridiculous, late-night, college-dorm-room nature of what I'm about to say, but here it is. I do not see how free will can exist. By free will, I mean, when you're staring at the menu, and you pick the salad over the burger or any other choice you make-- big or small-- who you marry, whether you keep listening to me for another minute.</p><p begin="00:46:11.81" data-timestamp="2771.81">Free will is the idea that you really get to pick. I'm saying you don't. I don't see how free will can exist.</p><p begin="00:46:19.32" data-timestamp="2779.32">I'm somewhat embarrassed to be saying all this. For awhile, I couldn't even talk with my wife about it. It's been on my mind because I was wondering if I should talk about it on the show today.</p><p begin="00:46:27.40" data-timestamp="2787.4">And we'd be making the kids' lunches for the next day. There'd be a gap in the conversation. I'd open my mouth, but I just couldn't do it.</p><p begin="00:46:35.68" data-timestamp="2795.68">I don't know why I'm thinking about this now. I think the last time I did was in high school. But I just moved on.</p><p begin="00:46:41.76" data-timestamp="2801.76">It seems inescapable though. Years ago, I went to grad school in physics. And I think, if you haven't had the experience of actually doing something like that, it's easy to be like, oh, science. There's lots of stuff they don't know.</p><p begin="00:46:54.12" data-timestamp="2814.12">But the truth is, we know a lot about how the world was put together. And please excuse the lecturing quality of this. But briefly, there are only four basic forces in the world-- gravity, electromagnetism, and two others, the strong force and the weak force, the first holds atomic nuclei together. The second, crudely speaking, powers the sun.</p><p begin="00:47:13.29" data-timestamp="2833.29">Our understanding of these forces has been tested and explored again and again. In one case that sticks with me measured and confirmed to an astounding 12 decimal places. These four forces explain how atoms stick together, how every bit of matter moves, and yes, even the bits of matter that make up us and our brains. We are just collections of atoms.</p><p begin="00:47:33.43" data-timestamp="2853.43">I don't see how those atoms can truly have any will. When you think you're deciding, I'm going to wear this shirt today, you can't really have decided otherwise. We are subject to the forces of nature, not one of them.</p><p begin="00:47:47.01" data-timestamp="2867.01">It turns out there is this one friend of our family-- hey, Stu-- who also does not see how free will can exist. I was talking to him on the phone, asking if he knew any serious-minded, credentialed people who I could talk to and put on the radio. As it happened, he was staring at his bookshelf. He had a whole collection.</p><p begin="00:48:02.49" data-timestamp="2882.49">There are books by a bunch of dead philosophers, thinkers of various sorts, and then one book by someone who seemed perfect-- Robert Sapolsky. Sapolsky is a professor at Stanford, Genius Grant recipient. He's a neuroscientist, who also spent 33 summers staring at baboons.</p><p begin="00:48:19.00" data-timestamp="2899">Just last year, he published this big book that was on my friend's shelf, called <i>Behave.</i> So I read it. And there is something curious about it. He seemed to be making the argument that there is no free will. But he never quite came out and said it.</p><p begin="00:48:33.43" data-timestamp="2913.43">The words free will don't even appear until page 580. The first 15 chapters are all about research into what drives human behavior, different parts of the brain, hormones, genetics, how we respond to sensory cues. Was he just avoiding coming out and saying it, like I've been?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:51.27" data-timestamp="2931.27"> So you ask this question, can there be free will? But I don't think you directly come out and say what you think. So what do you think?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:49:02.51" data-timestamp="2942.51"> I think I was basically trying to be polite there and sort of a good house guest. In actuality, I don't think there is room for the slightest bit of free will out there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:49:15.77" data-timestamp="2955.77"> Sapolsky said, this was, in fact, the entire reason he had written the book. He was trying to lead people slowly along a gentle path to this uncomfortable idea. I was reading it right.</p><p begin="00:49:27.03" data-timestamp="2967.03">I asked him why he doesn't believe we have free will. As a neuroscientist, he thinks about it this way. Take any action-- a movement of your eyebrow, something you say. Just trace that thing back. Behind anything like that are just some muscles that moved.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:49:41.71" data-timestamp="2981.71"> So let's simplify it. A muscle did something. Meaning a neuron in your motor cortex commanded your muscle to do that. That neuron fired only because it got inputs from umpteen other neurons milliseconds before.</p><p begin="00:50:00.00" data-timestamp="3000">And those neurons only fired because they got inputs milliseconds before and back and back and back. Show me one neuron anywhere in this pathway that, from out of nowhere, decided to say something that activated in ways that are not explained by the laws of the physical universe, and ions, and channels, and all that sort of stuff. Show me one neuron that has some cellular semblance of free will. And there is no such neuron.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:34.47" data-timestamp="3034.47"> Your emotions, consciousness-- same argument. At the bottom, just cells and chemicals acting like they would in the lab.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:50:40.86" data-timestamp="3040.86"> There's nothing more or less than the mechanics.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:44.46" data-timestamp="3044.46"> I mean, I feel like your whole book could have actually just been two sentences to cut to the chase, you know, not that I didn't enjoy the other chapters. What does it actually mean not to have free will? Do you think of it as, if you rewind the clock, it would all unfold the same way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:51:01.75" data-timestamp="3061.75"> Basically, it's got to mean that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:51:04.99" data-timestamp="3064.99"> I should say, there is some debate about whether no free will means that if you went back in time, and let your life unfold again, you would make all the same decisions exactly the same way. The reason there's some debate is that way down at the subatomic level, there does seem to be a little wellspring of randomness.</p><p begin="00:51:21.76" data-timestamp="3081.76">Quantum mechanics is all about probabilities. Like when a radioactive atom breaks apart, the exact moment it happens seems random. It's unclear how often this apparent subatomic randomness escapes into the larger world. But it could be that if you rewound the film of life and played it forward again, you might get a different movie. But it wouldn't be because of free will. It would just be subatomic randomness messing with the plot.</p><p begin="00:51:49.45" data-timestamp="3109.45">A friend of mine had this experience where he kind of got to test this out. His brain was artificially rolling back the clock, and he got to see its machine-like nature. He went ice skating, and he fell and hit his head, which gave him some temporary amnesia.</p><p begin="00:52:03.58" data-timestamp="3123.58">When he was on the stretcher, he asked what had happened. His wife said, you fell and hit your head. And he made this joke. That's not how you want to leave the ice. But then he kept asking what had happened and making the same joke, like, oh, I fell on the ice. I know a good joke to make here.</p><p begin="00:52:20.05" data-timestamp="3140.05">After, he said it was like opening up the hard drive of his mind and seeing inside. He's fine now, by the way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:52:32.90" data-timestamp="3152.9"> For me, it is the one scientific fact about the world that I am just not OK with. I'm fine with the big bang and that all of existence came from a tiny point. That doesn't faze me anymore. But I am not OK with the idea that I don't have free will. That seems-- I can't give that up. If I give that up, I'm giving up everything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:52:50.21" data-timestamp="3170.21"> I know. It's really, really hard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:52:52.61" data-timestamp="3172.61"> I feel like I'm deciding to say what I say right now. I feel pretty confident about that. When I think I'm making a decision, what am I actually doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:53:02.12" data-timestamp="3182.12"> Well, there's just a whole bunch of neuronal fulcra and some sort of Rube Goldberg sort of stretch of things that teeter this way or that and as a result, bounce something else in another direction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:53:15.60" data-timestamp="3195.6"> So while it feels like we could choose this or maybe that, the truth is, some set of events mechanically led to our final decision. We just aren't aware of it. Sapolsky brought of this famous experiment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:53:27.05" data-timestamp="3207.05"> Sit somebody down in the room and ask them to name their favorite detergent. And who knows what they're going to come up with. Do the same thing, and there's a picture of the ocean in the room on the wall. And they're now significantly more likely to say Tide. Tide's my favorite detergent.</p><p begin="00:53:45.08" data-timestamp="3225.08">And ask them why. And they will give you some [? Foucauldian ?] rational explanation about what Tide does to their strawberry stains on their shirts.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:53:54.71" data-timestamp="3234.71"> Sapolsky says, when we think we are making a decision, it is basically just some more complicated version of that. You were looking at the menu. The room was slightly warm. Your shoes were wet from the rain. The light above the table was just so, and so you picked the salad.</p><p begin="00:54:09.92" data-timestamp="3249.92">The mom who yells at the army general couldn't have done it any other way. Newt Gingrich, when he got to Congress-- same thing. Speaking of which, did we all just go and vote? Choose our representatives?</p><p begin="00:54:21.82" data-timestamp="3261.82">If you believe what I'm saying, no one really could have decided to choose differently. And look, I'm not saying, don't vote. You should vote. Do good things. Be kind. Give to charity.</p><p begin="00:54:33.35" data-timestamp="3273.35">I'm just saying, it's weird. We are machines that don't know it, but don't want to deal with it.</p><p begin="00:54:48.59" data-timestamp="3288.59">For Sapolsky, this idea that we don't have free will is truly profound and should change the way we think about lots of things. For instance, all those decisions you've made because you're a good person, all those things you're proud of-- don't be so proud. Anyone else starting with your atoms in the same place would have done the same thing.</p><p begin="00:55:06.46" data-timestamp="3306.46">When people do bad things, he says you shouldn't hate them. Probably also, he says, we should try to rethink the entire justice system, which, of course, is a weird thing to say since there is no trying.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:55:20.24" data-timestamp="3320.24"> It's just such a crazy-making idea, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:55:24.20" data-timestamp="3324.2"> Yup.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:55:25.52" data-timestamp="3325.52"> Are you OK with it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:55:27.08" data-timestamp="3327.08"> Not in the slightest. If I stop and really think about it, I get slightly panicked. There is no way to get out of an existential morass if you start really thinking about this stuff.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:55:37.76" data-timestamp="3337.76"> How often do you find yourself thinking about it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:55:39.92" data-timestamp="3339.92"> Oh, I don't know, maybe four or five times an hour. This is all I think about these days.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:55:48.71" data-timestamp="3348.71"> It's amazing to me that scientists don't talk about this more. I think I went my entire graduate career testing the fundamental laws of nature without it ever coming up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:55:57.53" data-timestamp="3357.53"> Hi. How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Sapolsky</h4><p begin="00:55:59.81" data-timestamp="3359.81"> How was the exam, the midterm?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:56:02.13" data-timestamp="3362.13"> This is Melissa Franklin, professor of physics at Harvard. And for years, she was my professor. I talked to her for the show when I was grappling with the possibility that we might be alone in the universe. So she seemed like the logical choice for this question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:56:16.67" data-timestamp="3376.67"> This is how you think about it too, right, that we can't possibly have free will?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:56:21.08" data-timestamp="3381.08"> I think that there's no evidence that we have free will. I mean, I guess it's possible. It seems unlikely. It seems like we have free will.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:56:34.82" data-timestamp="3394.82"> That's the thing, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:56:35.99" data-timestamp="3395.99"> Yeah. So I was asking one of my colleagues today, do you believe in free will? And he says, absolutely. And I said, do you think our brains are made up of neurons and axons and things? He said, yes.</p><p begin="00:56:49.80" data-timestamp="3409.8">And then I said, so how do you reconcile those two things? And he said, if it walks like free will and quacks like free will, it's free will.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:57:02.99" data-timestamp="3422.99"> So our word is wrong?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:57:05.21" data-timestamp="3425.21"> No, the point is that operationally, we appear to have free will.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:57:11.26" data-timestamp="3431.26"> But it's wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:57:12.25" data-timestamp="3432.25"> Yes, yes, it is wrong. But it seems like we do, so why not just go with the flow? That's the idea.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:57:20.73" data-timestamp="3440.73"> She was at lunch when this conversation happened. And immediately, another colleague jumped in to argue the other side.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:57:26.71" data-timestamp="3446.71"> And the other person was just saying, you're an idiot, without saying the word idiot. It's one of these things when you start to talk about things that you don't want to think about that you sort of hope that magic comes in some way.</p><p begin="00:57:43.97" data-timestamp="3463.97">So one of them was saying, well, there could be some complex thing that comes in that actually gives us free will. And the other person was saying, you're talking about magic or God. Just say it out loud-- magic or God.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:57:59.00" data-timestamp="3479"> Melissa is actually OK with the idea of not having free will.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Franklin</h4><p begin="00:58:02.81" data-timestamp="3482.81"> I think maybe the problem of just a machine is not a nice way of thinking about it. A human is not just a machine. A human is an amazing machine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:58:14.12" data-timestamp="3494.12"> Yeah, I know. I love the machine that is my wife and my two little machines. They're really adorable. But when I think about it, that's what they are. They're so cute, though.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:58:29.80" data-timestamp="3509.8"> I go back and forth on what to do with this information. Sometimes I feel like Robert Sapolsky does. That this is something deeply profound. We are machines that are smart enough to have figured that out, to realize we probably can't have free will.</p><p begin="00:58:44.26" data-timestamp="3524.26">And so we should think about what that means for how we organize our society, how we treat other people. But there is another part of me that feels like maybe it changes nothing at all, which is weird to know that we are all living with this illusion of free will, but somehow doesn't matter. I've come to think of my daily existence as kind of like being in a movie, where I'm just along for the ride.</p><p begin="00:59:08.42" data-timestamp="3548.42">I'm making choices all day long. But the machine that is me couldn't really have chosen anything else. It gives me a weird lightness when I think about it that way. And if I'm being honest, it also feels kind of cool knowing this thing that no one wants to face up to, watching us all run around as if not true.</p><p begin="00:59:28.31" data-timestamp="3568.31">When you pick a song to listen to, when you decide to try a second date, when you go left instead of right, when I say something stupid instead of just sitting and thinking for a moment, when I pick what picture to draw on my son's lunch bag, those aren't really choices. But I'm good at living with contradictions. It's in the machinery.</p><p begin="00:59:58.08" data-timestamp="3598.08"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:11.03" data-timestamp="3611.03"> Our show was produced today by David Kestenbaum.
