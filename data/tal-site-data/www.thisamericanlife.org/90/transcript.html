<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.50" data-timestamp="0.5">I had the strangest experience last night. I have these tapes, recorded on my answering machine 10 years ago. Tapes that I had not heard in a decade until last night. And I don't think I can play these tapes for you. I don't think that the people on them would give the permission. On one tape, there's a brief conversation between me and this woman who I lived with for seven years, accidentally recorded by the answering machine just as we were splitting up.</p><p begin="00:00:30.73" data-timestamp="30.73">And on this tape, she's calling me from the street to say that she's going to a movie with a friend. And I tell her I'd like to come along. <i>She's</i> <i>Gotta</i> <i>Have</i> <i>It</i> is the movie that they're seeing. And she indicates no, that I'm not welcome. And then I tell her, "Well, I guess maybe I really do have too much work to do and some laundry that I have to get done." And later in the conversation, she asks if I'm going to be up late, and I say no. And she says, "Well, I thought you said you had all this work to do," like she's catching me in a lie. I mean, she is. She is catching me in a lie. But you know, a lie that I kind of made at her bidding. And then she asked me if I'm absolutely sure that I'm going to get her laundry done that night. And I tell her I'm sure.</p><p begin="00:01:20.49" data-timestamp="80.49">It was hard to listen to. I can hear myself being so scared of her in this tape. And in this same conversation, she talks about this guy who, just a few weeks later, she got involved with, her next serious relationship after me. And I talk about this woman who I was just about to start seeing in this serious way, after her. And that part of the conversation is very awkward, very awkward.</p><p begin="00:01:50.52" data-timestamp="110.52">And before I heard this tape, I could not have remembered much about that summer, that summer where we were splitting up in 1988 after seven years. But hearing the tape, it all came back. Where we lived, what was in the apartment, what we used to wear, how we talked to each other, and how I felt all the time when we were together, this way that I don't feel anymore. And it messed me up.</p><p begin="00:02:22.98" data-timestamp="142.98">And it wasn't like looking at photos. Pictures are posed. Pictures are these tiny little-- they're tiny. You can hold them in your hand. They're 3-by-5. You can crush a picture. This was not posed. And it was not small. And part of that, I think, is just the power of recordings. And part of it was the fact that we were on the phone. There is something about being on the telephone. It's just so intimate. Talking to a person on the phone, you are right there. You are so close. It's like you're whispering in each other's ears.</p><p begin="00:03:14.57" data-timestamp="194.57">There are these tapes of Lyndon Johnson on the telephone in this audio book called <i>Taking</i> <i>Charge</i> by historian Michael Beschloss. And Beschloss makes the argument that without these recordings of Lyndon Johnson on the telephone, an important part of Johnson would be completely lost to history. These tapes are so raw. We hear him operating on people in this way that is so-- Beschloss makes the argument that it rarely comes through in transcripts of meetings or public events, him just trying to charm people and flatter them and play on their weaknesses and strong-arm them.</p><p begin="00:03:49.70" data-timestamp="229.7">And he's more honest on the phone than he was in public. In public, Johnson said that he believed the Warren Commission report. On the telephone, he admitted he didn't believe in it. He didn't believe that a lone assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone killing JFK. In public, Johnson supported the Vietnam War. On the telephone, he admitted his doubts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyndon Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:11.79" data-timestamp="251.79">I'll tell you, the more I just stayed awake last night thinking about this thing, the more I think of it, I don't know what in the hell-- It looks like, to me, we're getting into another Korea. And it just worries the hell out of me. I don't see what we can ever hope to get out of there with once we're committed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:28.45" data-timestamp="268.45">He's talking to National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyndon Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:32.19" data-timestamp="272.19">I don't think it's worth fighting for. And I don't think we can get out. And it's just the biggest damn mess--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mcgeorge Bundy</h4><p begin="00:04:36.79" data-timestamp="276.79">It is. It's an awful mess.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyndon Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:38.25" data-timestamp="278.25">I look at this sergeant of mine this morning. He's got six little old kids over there. And he's getting out my things and bringing me in my night reading and all that kind of stuff. And I just thought about ordering all those kids in there. And what in the hell am I ordering him out there for?</p><p begin="00:04:52.41" data-timestamp="292.41">[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p><p begin="00:04:52.66" data-timestamp="292.66">What the hell is Vietnam worth to me? What is Laos worth to me? What is it worth to this country? Now, of course, if you start running the communists, they may just chase you right into your own kitchen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mcgeorge Bundy</h4><p begin="00:05:10.96" data-timestamp="310.96">Yep, that's the trouble. And that is what the rest of that half of the world is going to think if this thing comes apart on us. That's the dilemma. That's exactly the dilemma.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyndon Johnson</h4><p begin="00:05:20.83" data-timestamp="320.83">But everybody I talk to that's got any sense in there, they just says, "Oh, my god, please [UNINTELLIGIBLE]" But it's damned easy to get in a war, but it's going to be awfully hard to ever extricate yourself if you get in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mcgeorge Bundy</h4><p begin="00:05:32.77" data-timestamp="332.77">It's very easy. I'm very sensitive to the fact that people who are having trouble with--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:42.11" data-timestamp="342.11">On the telephone, we are who we truly are, some of the time, anyway. Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, telephone stories, what we reveal about ourselves on the phone that we do not reveal any other way.</p><p begin="00:06:06.34" data-timestamp="366.34">Act One, When the Wall Came Tumbling Down, the story of a teenager, illegal drug use, lying, stealing, and a kid's life completely changed when he heard how he sounded on the phone. Act Two, When Your Telephone is Your Medium. Sure, you can try to get your pop songs onto records, onto the radio, onto MTV. But what if your medium of choice is the telephone? We offer a case example, the band They Might Be Giants. Act Three, Telephone as History, moments from a normal human life saved on answering machine. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: When The Wall Came Tumbling Down</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:52.41" data-timestamp="412.41"> Act One. Let's forget telephone numbers for a moment, and let's start with a zip code, 90210. That's where this story takes place, literally. Joshua was a student at Beverly Hills High School. Kids there had a lot of money, did a lot of drugs. And he started doing them, too, in a pretty serious way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joshua</h4><p begin="00:07:15.03" data-timestamp="435.03">I failed English. I failed PE, even, which is difficult to do, unless you're running off getting stoned whenever you're supposed to be running around the track. And I just did whatever I wanted to do, whenever I wanted to do it.</p><p begin="00:07:39.62" data-timestamp="459.62">I stole money from my parents kind of regularly to finance my marijuana habit. I did break into my parents' tenants', basically, house a few times, mostly to steal drugs, not money. But that was the only stealing that I did. I never actually stole anything except for drugs and money. And the money, I only stole from my parents.</p><p begin="00:08:16.16" data-timestamp="496.16">Well, I noticed my dad started to punish me for things that I hadn't done, or at least things that he couldn't have possibly known that I had done. And I would have a great weekend planned. For instance, we were going to go out and do whatever sorts of craziness would come up. Maybe we'll go take some LSD or something like that, or mushrooms. And my dad would ground me the day before for no particular reason. And it was very strange. The timing was uncanny.</p><p begin="00:08:55.74" data-timestamp="535.74">And one day, he was driving me down to school, as he did every morning. And on the way to school, he told me that the administration of Beverly had contacted him and that they had narcs in the school that were posing as students. And they were going to run a sweep of the school and basically bust everyone who was involved in this. So he told me that the administration had contacted him because they knew that I was involved in this whole faction of bad eggs. And they also knew that I was not a dealer. Basically, they were calling him to warn him to basically give me a chance to get out of the bust. So he told me I'd better get it together because it's going to happen very soon.</p><p begin="00:10:06.96" data-timestamp="606.96">And then, in the same conversation, he started naming all of the names of the kids that were involved. And they were names that there was no way he could know. And so the story was very credible the way it was laid out. And I believed it 100%. And I went to school that day, I remember, and of course, I told all of my friends that there was going to be this major bust happening at Beverly Hills High School very soon. And so everybody better quickly go undercover. And people became much more careful.</p><p begin="00:10:55.48" data-timestamp="655.48">About a month later, I was in the backyard. And there had been a windstorm the night before, a really big wind. And a panel on the side of the house had come off. And I was in the backyard with my friend. And we were smoking a joint like we always did. Every day after school, we would come home and smoke a joint. And my friend noticed this panel down.</p><p begin="00:11:27.20" data-timestamp="687.2">I'll never forget this one, actually. He said, "Dude, what is this? Come here, dude. And I'm standing on the other side of the backyard, smoking a joint, looking at the trees. And he's like, "Come here, dude." I walked over. He's like, "Look at this." And it didn't dawn on me. I looked at it, and I was like, "What is it? Strange piece of machinery inside of wall." It made no sense to me whatsoever. And he looked at me. He said, "Dude, your parents are taping your calls." And that meant that dad knew everything.

And I said, how can I do this? They said, well, what you have to do is get a voice-activated tape recorder. And you have to hook it up to the phone. So I removed an outside wall of my house, which was a bunch of boards. Removed it, built it into one situation where I could clamp it back on with magnets. So I could take it off and put it back on. I put this tape recorder inside the wall outside of my kitchen. The wire went down, and then it went through the wall into the tape recorder. I figured, nobody's ever going to notice that because it's way down on the bottom, way under everything.

It went on for about a month of me being perfect on the telephone. And it worked. He stopped busting me at crucial moments. I was able to go out and do everything I wanted to. I alerted everyone at Beverly that, in fact, there wasn't going to be a sweep, that it was all part of this scandal perpetrated by my father, and much to their relief. And so that went on for about a month, of this counter espionage, I guess you would have to call it. And it worked.</p><p begin="00:23:20.52" data-timestamp="1400.52">It had gotten to the point of deception upon deception upon deception, multiple lies on both sides. So I was very disturbed by the fact that my relationship with my father had so apparently deteriorated. My father means a lot to me. And he did then, and he always has. And I realized the degree to which we had grown apart, basically.</p><p begin="00:23:49.24" data-timestamp="1429.24">So one night, I went out with a couple of friends of mine. And we took some LSD, some very strong LSD that we had bought down in Hollywood from a dealer who was down there at that time, a guy by the name of Strange, was his name, actually. He was an albino. I think he's dead now. But anyway, in the throes of this LSD realization, enlightenment, that I was going through, I realized that the situation with my father was completely unacceptable. And it had to be remedied right away. I had to do something immediately about it.</p><p begin="00:24:33.86" data-timestamp="1473.86">So I told my two poor friends, who were also right in the middle of their trip, getting involved in whatever was going on in their minds. I said, "We have to go to my house. We have to go home right now." So we drove here. And Dad was having a party. There was a party going on. And I walked into the party rather nonchalantly. And I looked at my father with a very serious look. And I said, "I have to talk to you about something." So we walked outside to the yard out front. And I said, basically, "Dad, I know you're taping my calls. And I know you've been taping my calls."</p><p begin="00:25:25.44" data-timestamp="1525.44">It was such a strange sort of accusation I was making, once again, because simultaneously, I was admitting to him that I knew that he knew everything that was going on. So on the one hand, I'm saying, "Dad, how could you be so horrible as to invade my privacy like this?" while simultaneously realizing that he knew that I had been stealing money from him to support my pot habits. And he said, "You're right, I'm taping your calls. I've been doing it for quite a while, as a matter of fact. And I'm not going to do it anymore. I'm not going to tape your telephone calls anymore." He said, "There's something you don't know yet, but I'll tell you now. And perhaps you will not understand what I'm saying. But you think that because I'm your father and I'm in this role of the disciplinarian, that it's between you and I. What you haven't realized yet is that your actions have far more impact on your own life than they will on mine. I've already made my life. You have to make your life. And you don't know it yet." He said, "I'm going to take the tape recorder out tomorrow."</p><p begin="00:26:57.61" data-timestamp="1617.61">And I was waiting for the punishment at this point, because there must be some amazing punishment coming down. Because he knew everything. Military school, or what's he going to do? He said, "I'll take the tape recorder out tomorrow. And there's only one thing I want you to do." And I said, "What?" And he said, "I have about 40 tapes, about 40 90-minute tapes of you. I'm going to give them to you. And I want you to listen to them. And that's all I ask. No punishment. This is over. This chapter is over.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of reporters and writers and performers to tackle that theme. Today's show, things we learn on the phone, who we are on the phone, things we find on the phone that we can not find anywhere else. We have arrived at Act Two of our program, When the Telephone is Your Medium.</p><p begin="00:38:09.50" data-timestamp="2289.5">Well, the band They Might Be Giants do not have a song on every episode of <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. But I have to say, most weeks, at some point, contributing editor Sarah Vowell suggests a song of theirs that might work in the show. And that's because they are not only prolific. More than other bands, they write about an astonishing number of things in this surprising, funny way.</p><p begin="00:38:32.33" data-timestamp="2312.33">Also, although they are an actual pop band with actual pop hits, it is hard to think of any band in the last 20 years with more inventive arrangements. They just have this sound, this sense of how different instruments go together. They bring pre-rock instruments into the rock universe in this completely charming way. John Linnell of They Might Be Giants, he is the Keith Richards of the bass clarinet.</p><p begin="00:38:54.45" data-timestamp="2334.45">And at the heart of their artistic practices-- you know we have a theme to the show every week.

All they had was an answering machine and a dream. And that dream was to get people besides their friends to hear their music. Then they got a record deal. They were on the radio, on MTV, even.</p><p begin="00:40:52.42" data-timestamp="2452.42">They considered dismantling the democratic empire of Dial-a-Song. But they were afraid their fans would accuse them of selling out, of turning their back on the people-- and by the people, I mean the people. And you can understand that the first year, the first five years, even. But it's been 15 years now. This funny little idea that they had back during the early Reagan administration, now, it's just who they are. Ladies and gentlemen, they rock the stage, they rock the records, they rock the phone lines.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:41:26.48" data-timestamp="2486.48">Do you remember the first song, the first Dial-a-Song song?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Linnell</h4><p begin="00:41:28.79" data-timestamp="2488.79">I do. Because John said, I set it up. I was living in a different part of Brooklyn, so I phoned him up. And it was "Toddler Hiway." And he recorded it really quietly because we had this problem with the phone machine, where a loud sound with this particular model would actually tell the machine that that was the end of the message.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Flansberg</h4><p begin="00:41:48.51" data-timestamp="2508.51">It would think it was the beep.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Linnell</h4><p begin="00:41:50.09" data-timestamp="2510.09">It would think it was the beep. So almost all our songs had to be kind of tamed. And that particular note was completely off-limits.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Flansberg</h4><p begin="00:41:57.55" data-timestamp="2517.55">Yeah, anytime there was a long note sung, we would have to break it up. We would actually sort of pop it out of the mix. So it would just be like, "I've been ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah," to kind of keep it from just returning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:42:15.93" data-timestamp="2535.93">Sure, there are some adjustments you have to make if the telephone is the medium through which you express your art. But there are certain advantages to this system. You can monitor individual audience response in a way that's unavailable to more successful recording artists who restrict themselves to concerts and radio and TV-- you know, media where more than one person at a time can hear the song.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Flansberg</h4><p begin="00:42:39.33" data-timestamp="2559.33">Well, I think up until Dial-a-Song, we were the kind of guys who had a four-track recorder in their bedroom. And we would just overdub our voices or our instruments 5 million times, and go like, "Oh, listen to what the guitar sounds like if it's been overdubbed 5,000 times." And it would just kind of be, wahhhhhh. "Oh, that sounds really cool."</p><p begin="00:42:58.72" data-timestamp="2578.72">And then, doing Dial-a-Song actually made us realize, you're playing the song, people hang up in the middle, you can tell right away if they don't like-- you just sort of play your 5,000 guitar symphony over the thing. And two seconds into it, it's like, click. And you know that they hated it. So it really was-- it was definitely like rock school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Linnell</h4><p begin="00:43:18.62" data-timestamp="2598.62">It definitely moved us in a particular direction of really clarifying what we were doing, and also clarifying the arrangement, making it really simple sounding so that you could hear what was going on over the phone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:43:35.34" data-timestamp="2615.34">Right now, somewhere in this nation, there's a music student spending thousands of dollars to learn a discipline that he might master more quickly if he'd just invest in a decent voicemail system.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:43:56.99" data-timestamp="2636.99">Has it changed your ideas about where art comes from? Because I was reading that <i>New</i> <i>Yorker</i> article on Frank Sinatra. And there's this part where Ava Gardner runs out on him and breaks his heart. And he helps write "I'm a Fool to Want You." And then he stumbles into the recording studio and does it in one take and stumbles out in tears.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Linnell</h4><p begin="00:44:14.96" data-timestamp="2654.96">But he actually always stumbled in and out of the studio.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Flansberg</h4><p begin="00:44:18.31" data-timestamp="2658.31">But also, if you talk to Billy May or talk to the people who put the arrangement together or the person who wrote the song, they might disagree about where the greatness of any given song comes from. They're involved in the process, too. A lot of people like to think of inspiration as being, you're lying on the side of a hill, and you're waiting for the clouds to cover and then the lightning to strike you. It's this really elaborate, long process of kind of waiting for it to happen.

I used to agree with John Linnell. I used to think it was just the deliciously dark They Might Be Giants music that cheered me up during those darkest hour Dial-a-Song calls. And that's part of it.
