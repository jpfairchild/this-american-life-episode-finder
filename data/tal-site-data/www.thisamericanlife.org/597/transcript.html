<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.76" data-timestamp="0.76">There's this moment during the Cuban Missile Crisis that's so incredible, it doesn't sound real. But we have confirmed this with people who were there. Victor Gilinsky wrote about this for the <i>Bulletin</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Atomic</i> <i>Scientists.</i></p><p begin="00:00:11.00" data-timestamp="11">He said, basically, nuclear war seemed so imminent that the underground headquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska went into lock down. Nobody was allowed to enter or leave. He said the General in charge told the staff he expected an order to launch nuclear missiles any moment, and also expected that they would all die from a Soviet counterattack.</p><p begin="00:00:31.52" data-timestamp="31.52">And everybody was allowed to make one phone call home to their family. But in that call, they were not allowed to say why they were calling. What do you say in that situation?</p><p begin="00:00:42.22" data-timestamp="42.22">Gilinsky writes, "The conversations were about scraped kids' knees and sick dogs. It was a scene straight out of <i>Dr.</i> <i>Strangelove</i>." And of course, right? What can words do when you're staring death in the face?</p><p begin="00:00:56.08" data-timestamp="56.08">Well, today on our program, we have two stories where ordinary people rise to this exact task. They see death standing there, and they open their mouths. And truly amazing things happen.</p><p begin="00:01:08.16" data-timestamp="68.16">We have two stories for you today. And to say anything else about these stories, I think, would be a spoiler. Also, I want to give every possible second to these stories. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. And let's just get to it with the first act of our show.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Really Long Distance</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:27.03" data-timestamp="87.03">So remember that tsunami that hit Japan five years ago, March 2011? Giant black waves more than 30-feet tall hit Japan.</p><p begin="00:01:34.47" data-timestamp="94.47">[JAPANESE PEOPLE YELLING]</p><p begin="00:01:35.58" data-timestamp="95.58">A guy in a little town called Otsuchi shot this video. You can hear him yelling.</p><p begin="00:01:39.56" data-timestamp="99.56">[JAPANESE PEOPLE YELLING]</p><p begin="00:01:40.74" data-timestamp="100.74">All the houses are washing away.</p><p begin="00:01:42.39" data-timestamp="102.39">[JAPANESE PEOPLE YELLING]</p><p begin="00:01:44.39" data-timestamp="104.39"></p><p begin="00:01:44.79" data-timestamp="104.79">Otsuchi had been there for 100 years. In 30 minutes, it was gone-- almost totally flattened.</p><p begin="00:01:50.03" data-timestamp="110.03">The tsunami and the earthquake that went with it killed six times more people than died in 9/11-- over 19,000 people. Another 2,500 are still missing. And in the aftermath, of course, families struggled to figure out how they were going to move forward without the people they loved.</p><p begin="00:02:05.83" data-timestamp="125.83">And in that town of Otsuchi, it lead to this new-- I don't know, ritual is not exactly the right word for this. But it's something close to that-- this thing that people invented to stay connected to the dead. One of our producers, Miki Meek, has family in Japan.</p><p begin="00:02:18.35" data-timestamp="138.35">And she grew up going back and forth between there and here. And she watched this documentary about this thing people are doing Otsuchi, on the Japanese news channel, NHK, and got permission for us to play you some excerpts. Here's Miki.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:02:31.20" data-timestamp="151.2">Of all the areas in Japan affected by that tsunami, Otsuchi has one of the highest numbers of missing people-- 421. Today, it's still partly in ruins and partly a construction site, as they try to rebuild the town on higher ground. But a year before that tsunami happened, this guy named Itaru Sasaki-- he was already dealing with a loss.</p><p begin="00:02:52.53" data-timestamp="172.53">His cousin had just died. And Itaru was having a hard time figuring out how to talk about it. So he did something pretty ingenious.</p><p begin="00:03:00.71" data-timestamp="180.71">He went out and bought an old-fashioned phone booth and stuck it in his garden. It looks like an old English-style one. It's square and painted white, and has these glass window panes.</p><p begin="00:03:11.12" data-timestamp="191.12">Inside is a black rotary phone, resting on a wood shelf. This phone connected to nowhere. It didn't work at all.</p><p begin="00:03:18.54" data-timestamp="198.54">But that didn't matter to Itaru. He just needed a place where he felt like he could talk to his cousin, a place where he could air out his grief. And so putting an old phone booth in his garden, which sits on this little windy hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, it felt like a perfect solution.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Itaru Sasaki</h4><p begin="00:03:34.01" data-timestamp="214.01">[JAPANESE]</p><p begin="00:03:36.11" data-timestamp="216.11"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:03:38.79" data-timestamp="218.79">He's saying, because my thoughts could not be relayed over a regular phone line, I wanted them to be carried on the wind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Itaru Sasaki</h4><p begin="00:03:45.57" data-timestamp="225.57">[JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:03:47.89" data-timestamp="227.89">So I named it the wind telephone-- kaze no denwa. The idea of keeping up a relationship with the dead is not such a strange one in Japan. The line between our world and their world is thin.</p><p begin="00:04:02.10" data-timestamp="242.1">Lots of families keep a Buddhist altar for their dead relatives in the living room. My uncle has one for our family. There are photos on a little platform. And every day, he leaves fresh fruit and rice for them, lights incense, and rings a bell. It's a way to stay in touch, to let them know that they're still a big part of our family.</p><p begin="00:04:20.01" data-timestamp="260.01">So after the tsunami and earthquake happened, word got out about Itaru's special wind telephone-- that he was using it as another way to stay connected to the dead. Soon, people started showing up randomly on his property, and walking right into the phone booth. This has been going on for five years now. Itaru estimates that thousands of people from all over Japan have come to use his phone.</p><p begin="00:04:41.64" data-timestamp="281.64">A TV station asked Itaru, and the people who come to use his phone, if they could videotape their calls from a distance, and put an audio recorder in the phone booth. They wanted to get a sense of how people are still grieving. I watched their documentary after the fifth anniversary of the tsunami back in March. That whole week, all of the news programs in Japan were airing memorial programs.</p><p begin="00:05:04.21" data-timestamp="304.21">But I found the calls in this particular program remarkable and moving, for just how simple they were. One woman from Otsuchi, named Sachiko Okawa, showed up one afternoon. She's 71-years-old, and lost her husband in the tsunami.</p><p begin="00:05:18.55" data-timestamp="318.55">She regularly brings her two young grandsons to the phone booth. And you can tell, by how casually they talk to him on the phone. They squish into the phone booth with their grandma, wearing matching blue-and-black-striped shirts.</p><p begin="00:05:30.78" data-timestamp="330.78">Sachiko starts the call by picking up the receiver and saying hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sachiko Okawa</h4><p begin="00:05:34.10" data-timestamp="334.1">Moshi moshi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oldest Grandson</h4><p begin="00:05:35.00" data-timestamp="335">Moshi, moshi.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:05:35.90" data-timestamp="335.9">Her oldest grandson quickly jumps in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oldest Grandson</h4><p begin="00:05:37.96" data-timestamp="337.96">[JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:05:38.93" data-timestamp="338.93">Hi grandpa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oldest Grandson</h4><p begin="00:05:39.61" data-timestamp="339.61">[JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:05:40.58" data-timestamp="340.58">How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oldest Grandson</h4><p begin="00:05:41.39" data-timestamp="341.39">[JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:05:42.58" data-timestamp="342.58">I'll be in fourth grade next semester.

Then Sachiko corrects him. She says, no, Daina will be in second grade this year, not next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oldest Grandson</h4><p begin="00:05:56.53" data-timestamp="356.53">[JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:05:57.91" data-timestamp="357.91">Yeah, this year.</p><p begin="00:06:00.05" data-timestamp="360.05">A lot of calls were just like this, straightforward updates about life.
