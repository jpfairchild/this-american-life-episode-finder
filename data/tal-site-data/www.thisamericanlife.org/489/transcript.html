How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:00:07.51" data-timestamp="7.51"> Good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:08.62" data-timestamp="8.62"> Before we go any further, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Sarah Koenig, sitting in for Ira Glass. And you're about to hear this story the same way I did-- blind. All I know is that it's going to have a coincidence in it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:21.63" data-timestamp="21.63"> I have no idea what you're about to tell me, so lay it on me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:00:25.78" data-timestamp="25.78"> So the story is, I was a freshman in high school at Bozeman High School--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:32.44" data-timestamp="32.44"> Oh, in Montana.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:00:33.73" data-timestamp="33.73"> Yes. And I was in the orchestra. And it was early in my freshman year and I had made friends in high school, but didn't really have orchestra friends yet. And we were taking an orchestra trip. So that was a little nerve-wracking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:50.77" data-timestamp="50.77"> When you're a freshman, this qualifies as a demi-crisis. A long bus ride to Seattle, sharing a hotel room with someone you don't know. But there's this one girl, Lindsay. She and Hannah have friends in common so they decide to pair up-- to room together, to ride the bus together, to be orchestra friends.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:05.41" data-timestamp="65.41"> So we go to Seattle and we're like, it's awkward because we're new friends, trying to get to know each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:13.21" data-timestamp="73.21"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:14.05" data-timestamp="74.05"> And on one of our free days they send us to the Space Needle and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:19.66" data-timestamp="79.66"> I have.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:20.29" data-timestamp="80.29"> But there's that carnival area all around it. And we are playing the little games all around there and we won Poopatroopers. Do you know what those are?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:30.94" data-timestamp="90.94"> No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:31.98" data-timestamp="91.98"> OK. They're the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute. You're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute expands and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:43.54" data-timestamp="103.54"> Oh, what did you call them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:46.30" data-timestamp="106.3"> Poopatroopers?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:47.23" data-timestamp="107.23"> Really?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:01:49.18" data-timestamp="109.18"> I didn't quite believe Hannah about this, but she looked it up. It's true. Poopatroopers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:54.19" data-timestamp="114.19"> I just did a Google image search for Poopatroopers and I'm seeing images of the little guys.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:59.79" data-timestamp="119.79"> But wait. Is it a generic name or is it the brand name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:02.38" data-timestamp="122.38"> I think it's a brand name. I think, from what I'm seeing here, Imperial Poopatroopers, maybe?</p><p begin="00:02:08.41" data-timestamp="128.41">[SARAH LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:09.33" data-timestamp="129.33"> His Highness? Four star general Poopatrooper?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:13.01" data-timestamp="133.01"> Yes. Exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:16.39" data-timestamp="136.39"> Back to the plot here. Hannah and her new friend Lindsay go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to try out their prizes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:22.21" data-timestamp="142.21"> So we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and ran to the edge and threw the Poopatroopers over the edge. Because there's nothing to stop you, really. And we were just in peals of laughter and it was-- we thought it was so hilarious. And it sort of broke the ice in our friendship.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:41.01" data-timestamp="161.01"> Lindsay and Hannah become best friends all through high school. Cut to senior year-- four years later-- another orchestra trip. This time to Reno, Nevada. Hannah and Lindsay are in their hotel room studying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:52.24" data-timestamp="172.24"> And so Lindsay and I were both sitting at the desk in this hotel room in Reno, Nevada and a Poopatrooper comes flying out of the sky and lands on the windowsill of our hotel room where we are-- and we both-- we couldn't believe it. We opened the window and we grabbed the Poopatrooper. And we ran into the hall to try to find other people in our orchestra.</p><p begin="00:03:16.45" data-timestamp="196.45">We thought someone had been playing a trick on us. But no one knew what we were talking about. No one even remembered the thing in Seattle. And so I, still to this day, don't know why that happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:03:33.82" data-timestamp="213.82"> Every once in a while, we get pitches like this at the radio show-- coincidence stories. Since they don't really fit into our usual every week we bring you a theme format, we've been setting them aside wondering what to do with them. They mean so much to people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:03:47.56" data-timestamp="227.56"> I don't know. It felt like it was about our friendship. It felt-- I'm not someone that believes in God, really, but it felt a little bit like an act of God or something just cosmic and larger than us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:04:09.37" data-timestamp="249.37"> Finally, it hit us. If we got enough of them, we could put them on the radio as their own thing. So we put out a call to listeners-- send us your coincidence stories. And you did. Hundreds and hundreds of you did. We read at least 1,300 coincidence stories, interviewed dozens of people. Here are just a few things we've learned.</p><p begin="00:04:27.76" data-timestamp="267.76">You're most prone to coincidences when you're young-- teens or 20s. Lots of coincidences involve your grandmother. You're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands.</p><p begin="00:04:37.69" data-timestamp="277.69">Coincidences also happen to you in or near airplanes or on Craigslist. For many of you, coincidences were the answer to your prayers or helped you find your missing bike. Also, there are coincidences hidden in your name, your keys, your clothes, your address. Like when Flora and Ragaciano Pena first started dating.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Flora Pena</h4><p begin="00:04:55.80" data-timestamp="295.8"> When we met, he said that he was born in [INAUDIBLE]. And I said, well, I was, too. And then when we were going to get married and we needed our birth certificates, we compared them and it was the same building.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:05:13.93" data-timestamp="313.93"> We heard stories about a lost roll of film discovered, coincidentally, in the stomach of a decomposing hyena. About the man who got his favorite t-shirt back from a stranger's knapsack in Slovakia. About the woman who was dating not one, but two Mark Steven Andersons at the same time. About the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway and the one person who just happens to stop who comes to her rescue-- it's her dad who lives four hours away.</p><p begin="00:05:42.16" data-timestamp="342.16">And one of my favorites, from a woman named Jill Peterson, who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City. As they pull into the Second Avenue stop, there's a garbage can, perfectly positioned to help her out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Peterson</h4><p begin="00:05:53.02" data-timestamp="353.02"> So the train doors open and I'm beelining it for this can. And as I get there, out of the corner of my eye, I see another person heading my direction-- going for the can, too. And it's all coming up and I'm throwing up.</p><p begin="00:06:12.43" data-timestamp="372.43">And as I'm throwing up in this can, this person who's coming towards me starts throwing up in the can, too. And we're both simultaneously barfing into this can in the subway station. And we look at each other like, whoa.</p><p begin="00:06:26.17" data-timestamp="386.17">I don't know. How are you feeling? She's like, oh, I'm feeling a little bit better now. I'm like, me, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:06:34.17" data-timestamp="394.17"> What's the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers? Have a nice girl your age do it with you. And numbers-- so many coincidences with numbers. One woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with her extended family and they suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters in their names-- 23 letters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Van De Putte</h4><p begin="00:06:53.58" data-timestamp="413.58"> Michael Arthur van de Putte, Mary Elizabeth van de Putte, William Arthur van de Putte--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:06:59.47" data-timestamp="419.47"> There was the guy at the mall doing surveys who had to ask people their phone number.

And that, to me, was remarkable.</p><p begin="00:12:51.84" data-timestamp="771.84">This woman had seen the advent of cars and movies and computers and space travel, and this was her answer. At the time, I thought it was lame-- that maybe Esther was losing it a little. But since I started hearing all these coincidence stories the last couple of weeks, I've reconsidered. Coincidences feels so rare, and that sticks with you, even when the coincidence is barely a coincidence at all.</p><p begin="00:13:14.94" data-timestamp="794.94">An academic study of people's reactions to coincidence stories from the early 1980s found that we have an egocentric bias toward our own coincidences.

You would not believe what happened to me.</p><p begin="00:14:00.09" data-timestamp="840.09">And I always-- I was at the hospital with-- she lives with her cousin so she takes her cousin to the doctor's office quite a bit for appointments and stuff.

And I chose envy.</p><p begin="00:14:51.48" data-timestamp="891.48">So we had to create our own letter out of paper and then we had to safety pin it to our shirt and wear it around school the entire day. So as I was coloring in my letter and cutting it out, my mom was listening to the show <i>Monk</i> in the background.</p><p begin="00:15:08.35" data-timestamp="908.35">As we were watching it, I was literally cutting out my last line on the letter E for envy. And it said, on the show, I've studied the seven sins and the most prominent one is envy, as I was cutting out my letter. And so I immediately called my grandma and was telling her about it.</p><p begin="00:15:30.00" data-timestamp="930">And she was like, oh, uh-huh. That's a good one. Yeah. And then I didn't really hear back from her after that.

Still, I'm on her side here.

So it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold, as if you're going to go in a church in Italy and they had a fragment from the robe of some saint or something like that. And I called it the Immaculate Dollar of Arlington Heights.</p><p begin="00:23:40.64" data-timestamp="1420.64">So on Friday, I asked her out and she was all excited and we were all giddy. And then I said, hey, I have one more thing for you.

We got engaged. We got married. A couple of years later, we were unpacking at a new apartment that we had. And I had the-- I found the frame with the dollar in it. And I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room. I said, hey, you never told me about this dollar. What's the deal with that? She said, well--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:24:45.22" data-timestamp="1485.22"> When I was 19, I was a cashier working in a copy shop in downtown Chicago.

And I just thought, how do people know who the right person that they're meant to be with-- how do they know who that is?</p><p begin="00:25:03.80" data-timestamp="1503.8">I said, you know what? I'm not going to worry about that. I'm just going to put my name on this dollar bill. And the guy that gets this dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him.</p><p begin="00:25:12.79" data-timestamp="1512.79">And I'm like, well, you can't just write your name on one. Actually, I think it was more like maybe 10 or 12. And so this dollar bill that you gave me, I believe, is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on. And I knew that we were going to be married the day that you gave me this dollar bill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:25:33.16" data-timestamp="1533.16"> It was pretty crazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:25:34.48" data-timestamp="1534.48"> And then he made me tell him the story again. He asked me five or six times. And I said, the details don't change. It's the same story. He couldn't-- I think he was a little bit beside himself that that actually happened and that I didn't tell him.</p><p begin="00:25:53.20" data-timestamp="1553.2">I don't know how I found the will to not say anything to him, but I just remember do I, don't I, do I, don't I? What do I do? I didn't want to freak this guy out and be like, what, this girl's already talking about marriage? Wait, what? Forget it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:26:09.77" data-timestamp="1569.77"> I don't read too much into almost anything. I just kind of move forward. And then after she told me, I think I went through all the normal stages of whatever and I just thought, what does this mean for us? Are we going to invent a time machine or our kids going to bring world peace? What's the-- is there some sort of bigger thing that we're not seeing here?</p><p begin="00:26:37.38" data-timestamp="1597.38">Now it just sits in that very same frame up on our dresser and I look at it every day that I wake up. Sometimes I remind her that we have it when she's upset at me or angry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:26:50.96" data-timestamp="1610.96"> It's never been a question in my mind like, you know what? I'm going to kick this guy to the curb. But I do believe it's because of this dollar that I feel tied to him. Obviously, I love him, but I think that if it ever did cross my mind, I'd be like, but wait, this is my soulmate. I can't just walk out on him.</p><p begin="00:27:10.15" data-timestamp="1630.15">We don't even wear wedding bands. I'm like, why? I know I'm stuck with you. You got this dollar bill. I guess he could also put it back out into the register and then be like, look, I'm cashing this in. I think it's got to go to somebody else.

<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:28:20.04" data-timestamp="1700.04"> Act Three, Brother Can You Spare a Dime? This story comes from Ryan Rozar in Los Angeles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:28:26.69" data-timestamp="1706.69"> It happened when I was in college. I was actually pledging a fraternity. And I ran into some of the seniors on campus and they were laughing about something. And so one of them tells me this story that had happened to him that day, supposedly, where he gets in the shower and about 5, 10 minutes into his shower, he hears a "ting." And he looks down and sitting on the floor of the shower between his feet is a nickel. And has no idea where this nickel came from or why it's there.</p><p begin="00:29:05.63" data-timestamp="1745.63">Obviously, everyone was making jokes that he had change falling out of his butt and we were like, were you eating dollar bills? But anyway, we have our laughs and I go home and I don't think much about it. The next day, I get in the shower and like 5, 10 minutes into my shower, I hear a "ting." And I look down and right between my feet is a quarter.</p><p begin="00:29:36.33" data-timestamp="1776.33">So my first thought was, how did they do it? My thought was, I totally assumed that this must not have really happened to him. That was a set up and somehow they set this up to happen to me. But I could not figure out how. I was just like, it had to be a prank, basically.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:29:54.35" data-timestamp="1794.35"> Oh, that's so smart of you to figure out the whole con.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:30:00.92" data-timestamp="1800.92"> That's what I assumed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:30:01.85" data-timestamp="1801.85"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:30:02.15" data-timestamp="1802.15"> But then I go and I talk to him I tell him what happened to me.

Then a week later, I get in the shower and like 5, 10 minutes in, I hear "ting, ting." And I look down and there's about $0.35 between my feet.

So at this point, obviously, my mind's going to some weird places because I-- you don't want to be the butt change fairy guy. There's somehow-- there's just-- there's nothing-- no way that this story gets good for me.</p><p begin="00:31:01.21" data-timestamp="1861.21">And then no explanation comes, but it doesn't happen for a while-- for I want to say, probably, a month. Until one day, I'm about to get in the shower and I reach behind me to scratch my back and I feel something cold and metal on my back. And I turn around to show my-- to turn my back to the mirror--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:31:23.44" data-timestamp="1883.44"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:31:23.86" data-timestamp="1883.86"> And there is a whole pocketful of change stuck to my back?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:31:29.48" data-timestamp="1889.48"> What do you mean stuck to it?

It wasn't-- there was no adhesive or anything. It was just impressed into my back. So I figured out what was going on is that I have a bad habit of falling asleep with my pants on because it was college, I would nap a lot. And I would also sleep with my shirt off because my apartment was really hot.</p><p begin="00:31:56.01" data-timestamp="1916.01">So what was happening was change was falling out of my pockets onto my bed and I was laying on it and all that sweat and pressure was just sticking the coins to my back. They're just literally impressed into my back. And it was taking about five minutes of water running on it to dislodge them, at which point they were dropping at my feet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:32:28.37" data-timestamp="1948.37"> Clearly, I love this story, but I did not see the coincidence in it.

I think this is probably a common quirk of college boy life-- lounging around, shirtless and groggy, on unclean sofas and beds. Probably half the boys at his college had change stuck to them.

When he was 16, he was hanging out with two of his friends at someone's house. The parents weren't home-- they were goofing around, smoking pot. They were in the living room that had a huge window on one wall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:37:12.49" data-timestamp="2232.49"> And we're sitting there and we're sitting along this glass wall.

So they get out. They take the bag out. And they quickly run up this small hill that's behind his house.</p><p begin="00:37:49.26" data-timestamp="2269.26">And it's all wooded.

A coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection. It's that middle part-- meaningfully related-- that people seem to get stuck on.</p><p begin="00:41:45.67" data-timestamp="2505.67">Because when events line up just so, you can't help it. You can't help but wonder if there's a message in that. In that way, coincidences are like shortcuts to very big questions about fate, about God, even to people who don't believe in either one.</p><p begin="00:42:00.28" data-timestamp="2520.28">The notion that somewhere out there, someone or something is paying attention to your life-- that there might be a plan conjured through coincidences-- that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young. We got one story about a young couple visiting Marrakesh in Morocco. They're at a restaurant talking, like you do, about old flames. And the boyfriend wanted to know about one guy in particular.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Erik Johnson</h4><p begin="00:42:21.76" data-timestamp="2541.76"> I asked, Kate, Kate, what did this guy look like? And Kate just stopped dead in her tracks and lifted one hand to her mouth, with the other hand pointed across the restaurant. And she said, oh, my god. He looked like that. And she crossed the restaurant and tapped him on the back of the shoulder. And it was him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:42:44.42" data-timestamp="2564.42"> The daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was 19. She was listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leila Wright</h4><p begin="00:42:51.47" data-timestamp="2571.47"> I was listening to the song, "That Old Black Magic." And at the end of the song, Ella throws in a line, "that old black magic that Billy Daniels got me in." And I've heard her sing that line on that album dozens of times before and wondered, who's Billy Daniels?</p><p begin="00:43:07.60" data-timestamp="2587.6">But on this particular day, for some reason, I felt inspired to go out to the living room and ask my dad who Billy Daniels was. And he explained that in the '40s, Billy Daniels had sung "Old Black Magic" in a way that made it his song. And he was referred to as Mr. Black Magic, I guess, back in the '40s. And it was a big deal at the time.</p><p begin="00:43:27.26" data-timestamp="2607.26">And I asked my dad, had you met him? Did you ever know Billy Daniels? And he said that Billy Daniels was probably dead now.</p><p begin="00:43:34.93" data-timestamp="2614.93">And literally at that moment, the phone rang. So I answer the phone. And this playful, gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley. And I said, who's calling? And he said, Billy Daniels.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:43:58.85" data-timestamp="2638.85"> So, last September, I was living in Roswell, New Mexico. And I had woken up in jail for the last time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:44:07.52" data-timestamp="2647.52"> This is Etta Thordarson. When this happened, she was 20 years old, on drugs, hanging out with street kids. Her mom offered to buy her a bus ticket to Washington state to go to rehab. Etta said, yes.</p><p begin="00:44:18.86" data-timestamp="2658.86">She took her dog and got on the bus. In Los Angeles, there was a stopover at the depot and this guy comes up to her while she's waiting in line to get food. She's got $2-- just enough for some French fries. The guy starts asking her questions about her dog.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:44:32.09" data-timestamp="2672.09"> And he starts asking me other random questions, like, what are you doing? Where are you going? And then he asks me, are you from Alaska?</p><p begin="00:44:40.97" data-timestamp="2680.97">And I was like, yeah, I am, actually. And then he asked me, is your mom named Meg? And I was like, mm-hmm. Yeah. She is.</p><p begin="00:44:51.15" data-timestamp="2691.15">And he was like, oh, well-- well, I'm Chris. I'm your father. I met you 10 years ago.

Did you think, oh, well, here's how this is going to go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:45:37.74" data-timestamp="2737.74"> Yeah. I really thought we were going to go sit down and eat together and I was going to lay out my whole life story for him and he was going to explain his life and where he's been. I was looking forward to that. But it didn't happen. Mostly, I want to study his face for longer just because that's-- I've seen him twice and I still can't really remember what he looks like.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:04.82" data-timestamp="2764.82"> Do you regret not pursuing him in some way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:46:09.98" data-timestamp="2769.98"> Yeah, absolutely. In the moment, I was just-- I was so sick. I just really couldn't comprehend. It wasn't until I got on the bus that I was just-- why didn't I run after him? I've just spent my whole life wondering about this man and the chance to talk to him was put right in front of my face and I didn't really understand that at the time. And I let it go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:42.55" data-timestamp="2802.55"> Emiliana Garcia-Sarnoff also hadn't seen his father in many years, since he was seven or eight years old. He lived in California, but he was visiting a national park in Mexico with his mother when he was 18 and they hiked to the top of a pyramid there. The whole place was sort of off the beaten track.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emiliano Garcia-sarnoff</h4><p begin="00:46:58.68" data-timestamp="2818.68"> We were walking along and some people passed in front of us and my mom said, oh, my god. Raul? And then she turned to me and said, that's your father. That's your dad. And it was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:18.09" data-timestamp="2838.09"> Also, coincidentally, it was Father's Day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emiliano Garcia-sarnoff</h4><p begin="00:47:21.15" data-timestamp="2841.15"> I ended up, embarrassingly, breaking down and crying on that pyramid. It was a really emotional moment for me. My father definitely-- his absence meant a lot to me. And we said, yeah, we're going to stay in contact.</p><p begin="00:47:33.32" data-timestamp="2853.32">And after they said bye, they left. And he came running back up the hill about 20 minutes later. And you could hear him panting. And he said, Emiliano, I just want to say I'm sorry that I didn't stay in touch and that I love you. And he turned and went back down the hill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:54.09" data-timestamp="2874.09"> Emiliano's story goes the way Etta wishes hers had gone. After a rocky few years, he and his father did get to know each other and each other's families. Emiliano had a son who now had a grandfather. Emiliano's father had left him when he was a baby, but when his father died some years ago, Emiliano was there at the hospital. They'd had a real relationship and that never would have happened, Emiliano said, if he hadn't seen him that day at the pyramid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emiliano Garcia-sarnoff</h4><p begin="00:48:18.78" data-timestamp="2898.78"> Walking down that pyramid, I was talking out loud to myself. And I was saying-- this is one strong memory I have. I was saying, don't forget, don't forget. Just getting angry with my future self, which I knew would rationalize this event.</p><p begin="00:48:35.13" data-timestamp="2915.13">Because I had a very distinct sense that I had felt that this was definitely a miracle. Something had intervened and brought us together. You don't just run into your father on top of a pyramid. So I think I was a believer for about a week. And then--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:48:55.00" data-timestamp="2935"> And then, that very pause--</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Five: What Are The Chances?</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:48:58.16" data-timestamp="2938.16"> That brings us to Act Five, What Are the Chances? In order to let a good coincidence live a long and healthy life-- to get told and retold and take its rightful place in the narrative of your life-- sometimes you have to stop yourself from thinking it all the way through-- why it happened, really. Because the fact is, any statistician will probably rain on your parade, will tell you these things happen a lot more often than you think.</p><p begin="00:49:21.41" data-timestamp="2961.41">But a good coincidence is like a good magic trick. When you see one, a struggle ensues instantaneously between the thrill of the apparent miracle and the urge to debunk it. This final story is by Kerry Weeks. He's a prop guy for the movies, but he told this at a storytelling competition.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kerry Weeks</h4><p begin="00:49:38.33" data-timestamp="2978.33"> Here's my story. I'm nine years old-- first time going to summer camp. And my grandfather gives me-- before I go, he gives me his old pocket knife. It's practically an antique. And so the first thing all of us boys do when we get to camp is we pull out our knives and we start throwing them at things, trying to get them to stick the way Daniel Boone did. And because it's the 1970s, there's nothing unusual about a bunch of young children throwing sharp knives around.</p><p begin="00:50:06.13" data-timestamp="3006.13">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:50:07.55" data-timestamp="3007.55">And I got mine to stick in the floorboard. It was like, "wong." And it was great. But when I pulled it out, the tip broke off.</p><p begin="00:50:17.41" data-timestamp="3017.41">But anyway, camp goes on. And a few days later, I notice my knife is missing. And I look everywhere for it. I look high, I look low. It's gone.</p><p begin="00:50:25.60" data-timestamp="3025.6">But then one day, I'm walking through camp and I see this group of boys throwing knives at a tree and something tells me I should check this out. And sure enough, there's this boy in there throwing my knife. Now, there's no mistaking this knife because the handle was red and green, but the colors met in the middle and kind of swirled together in a trippy, psychedelic way. And I've never seen a knife like that before or since.</p><p begin="00:50:52.63" data-timestamp="3052.63">So I walk up to this boy. He's a little older, but I walk up to him and I say, hey, that's my knife. And he says, no, it's mine. And I say, no, that's my knife. My grandfather gave it to me. And he says, no, he didn't.</p><p begin="00:51:06.39" data-timestamp="3066.39">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:51:09.18" data-timestamp="3069.18">He says, my grandfather gave it to me. And I'm confused all of a sudden. Maybe I should have thought this through a bit more. I thought he would just hand it over. And the other boys-- they move in close. And I'm thinking, could it be possible that his grandfather gave him the exact same knife that my grandfather gave me? Is this a thing and I just didn't know it?</p><p begin="00:51:36.24" data-timestamp="3096.24">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:51:38.72" data-timestamp="3098.72">But I look at the knife he's holding in his hand and I look at the blade and I see that the tip of the blade is squared off, as though it were broken. And I say, that's my knife because I broke the tip off when I stuck it in the floor. And he says, what, that? No, it came that way so you can use it like a screwdriver.</p><p begin="00:52:01.91" data-timestamp="3121.91">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:52:05.53" data-timestamp="3125.53">And I look at the other boys and I'm not getting any help from them. And so I wander off, just thinking to myself, screwdriver. I never thought of that.</p><p begin="00:52:16.64" data-timestamp="3136.64">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:52:19.60" data-timestamp="3139.6">Well, as you can imagine, this really bugged me. And I don't mean just while I was at camp, but for the rest of my life.</p><p begin="00:52:26.82" data-timestamp="3146.82">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:52:31.49" data-timestamp="3151.49">And I kept thinking, why did I fold so easily? Why didn't I go to the counselors? And the only thing I can think of is this.</p><p begin="00:52:40.13" data-timestamp="3160.13">I'm the son of a physicist. And I used to ask my dad these questions all the time like, Dad, how far away is the sun? Dad, how fast is the speed of light? Dad, what's the closest star? And he would give me these answers and these numbers that were just so [BEEP] huge, I couldn't get my mind around them.</p><p begin="00:53:01.43" data-timestamp="3181.43">So my point is this. I, better than most other children, had an idea of just how vast the universe is.</p><p begin="00:53:11.08" data-timestamp="3191.08">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:53:12.63" data-timestamp="3192.63">And therefore, how infinite the possibilities are. So the thing is, at the time, I thought, well, maybe the kid's telling the truth. The only reason why I bring this up is because this is what I was thinking of when, some 32 years later, I become the landlord of a small apartment building. And one of the first things I did as a landlord was I threw this guy out because he was a small time drug dealer.</p><p begin="00:53:42.45" data-timestamp="3222.45">On the day he's moving out, I get a call from his neighbor across the hall-- a guy I call Budweiser Bob. And Budweiser Bob says, hey, that druggie is stealing your refrigerator.</p><p begin="00:53:55.64" data-timestamp="3235.64">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:53:59.08" data-timestamp="3239.08">And so I hop down there. And sure enough, in the driveway is a pickup truck. And in the back of the pickup truck is a refrigerator.</p><p begin="00:54:06.57" data-timestamp="3246.57">So I charge up the stairs and I demand to know just what the hell is going on. And Nick, the druggie, calmly tells me-- he says, dude, when I moved in here, that refrigerator was so gross, I bought my own refrigerator and swapped it out. And I put that one in storage. And now I'm just putting it back.</p><p begin="00:54:26.07" data-timestamp="3266.07">And I look in the kitchen. And sure enough, there's another refrigerator. It's a little old, a little dirty, but it's working.</p><p begin="00:54:32.61" data-timestamp="3272.61">And I'm trying to think this through. Would someone really go to all that trouble of just swapping out a refrigerator and then putting it in storage and bringing it back? Or would a guy go to the trouble of stealing a used refrigerator just to screw his landlord and replacing it with an even more used refrigerator?</p><p begin="00:54:52.32" data-timestamp="3292.32">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:54:55.53" data-timestamp="3295.53">And well, the answer to both these questions is yes.</p><p begin="00:54:59.42" data-timestamp="3299.42">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:55:02.90" data-timestamp="3302.9">But I look up, and there's Nick. And he's expecting me to say something. And there's his buddies, who are helping him move. And they're expecting me to say something. So I walk up to Nick and I look him in the eye and I say to him, you sweep up real good before you leave.</p><p begin="00:55:21.53" data-timestamp="3321.53">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:55:23.19" data-timestamp="3323.19">Because there's just too many possibilities in this universe. Thank you.</p><p begin="00:55:28.32" data-timestamp="3328.32">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:55:31.47" data-timestamp="3331.47"> Kerry Weeks lives in New York.
