<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:02.29" data-timestamp="2.29">To fight those massive fires out west... there are these camps, hidden from view. If you were driving by, you might not even know they're there. One of the largest fires in California history, the Creek fire, has a base camp for 700 people in the parking lot of a ski resort in Central California, just outside Fresno.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:00:30.06" data-timestamp="30.06"> Hose that!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:00:30.95" data-timestamp="30.95"> Pull!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:00:31.41" data-timestamp="31.41"> Pull!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:31.90" data-timestamp="31.9"> So if you know where to go, the first thing that you see when you pull up to camp is these 20 somethings running back and forth with bright yellow firehose, hundreds and hundreds of miles of it. Their job is to untangle miles of hoses all day, every day.</p><p begin="00:00:46.16" data-timestamp="46.16">One of our producers, Miki Meek, recorded the sound that you're hearing right now and talked to these guys, including RJ Brown, who's 23, in a dirt streaked yellow jacket and a face mask with a panda nose and mouth printed on it. The official motto of his employer, the California Conservation Corps, which sends young people all over the state to do this kind of job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:01:04.05" data-timestamp="64.05"> Hard work, low pay, miserable conditions, and more.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:07.51" data-timestamp="67.51"> You guys, what?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:08.72" data-timestamp="68.72"> "Hard work, low pay, miserable conditions, and more"-- that is the actual motto.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:12.52" data-timestamp="72.52"> What's the best part of your job, and what is the worst part of your job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:01:16.25" data-timestamp="76.25"> The best part? Oh, I should know. Hang on. I'm going to start with the worst part. Just the worst part is when they say over here on the walkie talkie, oh, we got 60,000 layers of hoses coming in. And then, once the 60 comes in, they bring in another 30.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:01:33.31" data-timestamp="93.31"> So when you hear 60,000 hoses coming over the radio, what is going through your head when you hear that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:01:39.00" data-timestamp="99"> Defeat. Like, I want to go home. I'm like, oh, no, no, no. I don't want to do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:45.45" data-timestamp="105.45"> The way this job works is this. Trucks come back from the fire line and dump huge piles of jumbled hoses. Five guys untangle them. And then, with each hose, they take one end--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:57.94" data-timestamp="117.94"> All right, ready? Everybody grab a corner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.82" data-timestamp="119.82"> --and sprint across the parking lot. Each hose is 100 feet long, so it's kind of a long way to go. They lay down one bright yellow hose next to another next to another, until the whole parking lot is blanketed with tidy yellow hose.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:02:13.74" data-timestamp="133.74"> What do you do to keep yourself sane when you're rolling hoses?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:02:16.86" data-timestamp="136.86"> I'll just be thinking about music in my head that I have already listened to. And it just keeps me going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:22.06" data-timestamp="142.06"> They're not allowed to wear headphones on this job. His teammate, Kory Rovy, has a different strategy to deal with that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kory Rovy</h4><p begin="00:02:28.44" data-timestamp="148.44"> I sing it out, and I tell everybody.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:02:30.67" data-timestamp="150.67"> What song's on your mind lately?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kory Rovy</h4><p begin="00:02:32.13" data-timestamp="152.13"> "Can't Break My Stride." It goes like, last night I had the strangest dream. I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find ya. Ain't nobody going to break my stride. And so, that song just keeps going in my head.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:02:43.42" data-timestamp="163.42"> Why that song?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:44.41" data-timestamp="164.41"> Next step in this process, they wind the hoses up in coils, put them on pallets, wrap them in plastic wrap, and send them to be cleaned. After that, the hoses go out to the fire line again, then back to the hose rolling crews, then back to the place where they're cleaned over and over, week after week after week, which is life at a fire camp. They have the same day over and over and over, until the fire's out.</p><p begin="00:03:16.97" data-timestamp="196.97">When Miki visited, the Creek fire had been going for nearly two months. It burned more than 350,000 acres. It's over 500 square miles. Putting out a fire that large is a mammoth task. The base camp that Miki met RJ and Kory at, it was like a mini city with a makeshift laundromat, a cafeteria, a mechanic shop, sleep trailers with triple bunk beds. Like most people at the camp, Kory and RJ work 16-hour days. And they sleep right on the asphalt, right next to where they work in tents they've pitched. They sleep in their uniforms so they can squeeze in a few extra minutes of rest each morning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:03:51.09" data-timestamp="231.09"> I was curious. What do you guys dream about at night?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:03:53.38" data-timestamp="233.38"> [LAUGHS] My dream yesterday was about hoses. It was about rolling hoses. I was so mad. Like, oh, I can't take no breaks, no days off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:04.16" data-timestamp="244.16"> But the thing about RJ and Kory, they love their jobs, despite the repetitiveness and exhaustion. Before this, RJ worked retail and at a car wash. Kory had an office job coding. Now it feels like they're part of something important. They're team captains for their crew, and they have this can-do attitude that it's actually kind of the culture of this camp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:04:25.12" data-timestamp="265.12"> I just make sure that the crew's PMA is always at its highest.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:04:29.36" data-timestamp="269.36"> What does that mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:04:30.21" data-timestamp="270.21"> Positive Mental Attitude.</p><p begin="00:04:31.82" data-timestamp="271.82">(SUBJCET) KORY ROVY: Me and Ricky will say something like, hey, yeah, just keep the PMA up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:04:35.47" data-timestamp="275.47"> Is that a well-known acronym?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rj Brown</h4><p begin="00:04:36.95" data-timestamp="276.95"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:04:38.01" data-timestamp="278.01"> I had never heard of that acronym. I could use some more PMA in my life right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:42.22" data-timestamp="282.22"> With the fire season running longer than ever, it's seven or eight months out of the year now. There's this entire ecosystem of people like RJ and Kory who swoop in and live in fire camps for months all over the west. Today on our program, we meet the people putting these fires out, doing all kinds of jobs you never think of to do it in this unusual situation where they have to push the same boulder up the same hill every single day.</p><p begin="00:05:06.22" data-timestamp="306.22">And in the second half of the program, we have a different large group of people who are battling a different large sort of threat. And the stakes could not be higher. They're literally trying to save the world. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: The Extinguishers</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:25.13" data-timestamp="325.13">Act One, The Extinguishers. So we heard about these fire camps from Lizzie Johnson. She's a reporter with the San Francisco Chronicle and spends most of the year chasing fires around California, covering them, and knows so much about them. She took Miki and one of our other producers, Lilly Sullivan, to the fire camp at Creek Fire and has these stories of the people there and what they do and of daily life in this place. Here's Lizzie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:05:53.69" data-timestamp="353.69"> The drive up to the Creek Fire base camp should have been beautiful. This is Ansel Adams country in the High Sierra. But the two-laned highway was lined with trees that looked like charcoal toothpicks. We passed houses where the only thing still standing were the chimneys. The local gas station reminded me of a Salvador Dal&#237; painting. The letters on the big sign out front had melted, dripping down like icicles.</p><p begin="00:06:20.16" data-timestamp="380.16">I've been to dozens of fire camps. At the big ones, there's always a stand selling T-shirts printed with the year and the name of the fire. And you see firefighters wearing them. There's a predictable rhythm to daily life at these camps. They start with a briefing right at 7:00 AM. This is where everyone gets their orders. At the Creek Fire, this happens by the ski lift.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supervisor</h4><p begin="00:06:43.00" data-timestamp="403"> Quick roll call.

They looked cold, tired, wearing thick stocking caps and heavy jackets. Hundreds more are listening on the radio. This was day 48 of their fight against the Creek Fire.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supervisor</h4><p begin="00:07:01.41" data-timestamp="421.41"> Plan on your same work assignments today. We're just really controlling that perimeter and making sure nothing moves on us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:07:08.38" data-timestamp="428.38"> There's no way to put out a fire this big, so the best they can do is stop it from growing. The actual mechanics of that feels surprisingly primitive. Hundreds of crews spread out all along the fire's edge, working on their own little speck of land, scraping the ground down to mineral dirt with chainsaws and shovels and bulldozers, so there's nothing left to burn when the wildfire gets there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Supervisor</h4><p begin="00:07:31.08" data-timestamp="451.08"> So be flexible is kind of a key to it. If something changes where we need to move equipment around, that's kind of some of our reasoning for not getting rid of a ton of stuff yet. Because I know you guys are kind of getting Groundhog Day out there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:07:42.80" data-timestamp="462.8"> A lot of the top brass, the incident command team, spoke to the firefighters through two flat screen TVs set up on a platform. They were at a command post more than an hour away. To me, it sounded like a county fair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:07:55.63" data-timestamp="475.63"> All right, thanks, John. Next up, fire behavior. Patty Johnson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Patty Johnson</h4><p begin="00:08:00.30" data-timestamp="480.3"> Morning. The most growth yesterday was out in this Edison Lake area, mainly closer to the South Fork out here than any place else. Just for the folks in the field, lots of heavy fuels burning out there, lots of smoke coming out of it. So make sure you take breaks with your being in the smoke every day. Probably for some folks, it's 24 hours of smoke that they are experiencing out there. Have a good day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:08:26.97" data-timestamp="506.97"> All right, thanks, Patty.

The people at the center of the operation are the hotshot crews. They're the most elite of the wildland firefighters, dispatched to the hottest and the farthest corners of the blaze. In the social hierarchy of fire camps, the hotshot crews are at the top.</p><p begin="00:08:47.71" data-timestamp="527.71">After the morning briefing, I talked to Pete Rosas in the parking lot. He is a squad boss for a hot crew out of LA County. His wife's also a wildland firefighter on a different crew. She drives a water truck called the tender. He told me that in the last month, they'd only overlapped at home one day, which was challenging with a two-year-old daughter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:09:07.07" data-timestamp="547.07"> We bounce back and forth between my family, her family, and daycare.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crew</h4><p begin="00:09:13.23" data-timestamp="553.23"> Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:09:14.92" data-timestamp="554.92"> That's a bunch of young guys from his crew, sticking their heads out the windows of their sherbet green bus-- it's called a buggy-- chirping, "Pete, Pete, Pete."

You guys are up to something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:09:52.43" data-timestamp="592.43"> Pete's crew is called Little Tujunga or Little T for short. At 42, Pete's been on the crew the longest. Some of the younger guys joke that he hatched from an egg at the fire station and keeps them all safe under his wing. Pete's not just their boss, he's a life coach, a mentor, and a therapist all rolled into one, giving them advice on everything from how to clean their chainsaws to buying their first house. He even reminds them to pay their bills back at home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:10:19.65" data-timestamp="619.65"> I feel sometimes like I am their dad. The reason it's like that because I'm with them so much more than I am with my own family. It's like I know what makes them go off, what doesn't, how to calm them down, how to rile them up when we need them to be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:10:38.83" data-timestamp="638.83"> Pete's on the shorter side. He's got skull tattoos on his arms to remind himself that death's part of life. The crew knows him for his cool head. He keeps a book called The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck in the side compartment of his truck. He grew up on the east side of LA, still lives there.</p><p begin="00:10:56.19" data-timestamp="656.19">As a kid, Pete says he never went camping or hiking, never even visited the mountains. He ended up in this job on a total fluke. Back in the early 2000s, the Forest Service was trying to hire more people of color.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:11:08.35" data-timestamp="668.35"> I remember it came out in The LA Times and it said, "Hiring 500 firefighters." It was, like, front page. And so, all my buddies came to me. I was the guy with the car. Like, hey, can you take us to this? Drop us off. You know we want to go. I ended up taking them. I ended up staying with them a couple hours in line. I put in an application. So I think a month and a half later, I get a call from the Stanislaus National Forrest offering me an apprenticeship. And the rest is history, I guess.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:11:38.97" data-timestamp="698.97"> Little T is now majority Latino with a lot of first generation firefighters like Pete, kids of immigrants. Here's a typical day for the hotshots at camp. After that morning briefing, they load onto their buggies with backpacks crammed with chainsaw fuel, tools, and water. Their packs can weigh up to 50 pounds. They even carry their own stretcher because if one of them gets hurt, they're on their own. They then drive out on a narrow backcountry road, pull up alongside a mountain, and start hiking in the wilderness. It's a brutal 2.8 mile trek to their job site. No trail, no switchbacks, no signposts. They had to keep going back there for two weeks. Here's one of the rookies on Little T, Zach Hanson.</p><p begin="00:12:21.47" data-timestamp="741.47">[(SUBJECT) ZACH HANSON: Every day, you're like, we're doing it again? Again, we got to go up there? And there is about a foot of ash the whole time on the ground and your foot sinking into the ground. And then, there's rocks under the ash. So your boots are getting torn up on these big boulders. But the ash is probably the biggest part because you're just constantly breathing in ash.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:12:43.03" data-timestamp="763.03"> They're not issued protective breathing gear. And smoke exposure may be why cancer rates are higher among firefighters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Hanson</h4><p begin="00:12:50.53" data-timestamp="770.53"> I mean, for me, when I got to the top, I was spitting black. And when you're pushing at a pace hard like that, I was breathing out of my mouth most of the time, which you try not to do, but I was doing it. And so, my teeth were black. Everything was black. The whole crew was coughing like they had smoked cigarettes their whole life. I think we accepted it at some point. This is our life now, so we'll just keep going up there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:13:14.98" data-timestamp="794.98"> Every single day, they had to return to the same area, a little patch of the Creek Fire about six miles long. The flames were threatening to blow out into a new part of the forest. The air was so smoky that planes couldn't get in to do regular water drops. So for most of their 16-hour workday, Little T revved up their chainsaws and sliced down burning trees.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Firefighter</h4><p begin="00:13:38.16" data-timestamp="818.16"> No! Woo! Woo! Woo. Woop woop.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:13:40.29" data-timestamp="820.29"> They cleared huge piles of brush and branches with their hands and scraped out a dirt path with what are essentially common gardening tools-- rakes, hoes, axes. This path can be up to 30 feet wide. The goal is to give the fire no place to go. Sometimes they literally fight fire with fire, torching trees and brush before the wildfire can get there. They have one of those jobs that's both monotonous and super dangerous.</p><p begin="00:14:09.08" data-timestamp="849.08">All the while, they have to be on the lookout for falling trees, called snags. They're one of the ways that hotshots get killed in the fields. Little T ran into a lot of snags their first few days on the Creek Fire. Here's one of the guys on the crew, Frank Plasencia Jr.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank Plasencia</h4><p begin="00:14:23.86" data-timestamp="863.86"> Your heart's pumping. Your adrenaline's pumping. You're scared, you're worried, you're nervous. We yell, "snag," or "tree," and we all have to bail out. And you can't control it. You could be just walking by a tree and just boop, and it falls. Big or small, they'll go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:14:37.44" data-timestamp="877.44"> When trees are falling, what does that sound like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank Plasencia</h4><p begin="00:14:40.92" data-timestamp="880.92"> It's a loud crack. It feels suspenseful because you don't know where it's coming because you're surrounded by trees. If it's a big tree, it's a big boom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:14:47.32" data-timestamp="887.32"> It shakes the ground. It'll shake the ground. And so, you feel that. Yeah, it's not a good feeling. It's definitely not a good feeling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:14:54.85" data-timestamp="894.85"> Again, here's Pete, who's been hotshotting for more than a decade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:14:58.39" data-timestamp="898.39"> There's been trees that have fallen right where I was standing, literally within seconds of me taking three steps. Like, fuck, that literally could have been it. OK, I got to clear my mind of this because I got the rest of the assignment or the rest of my career to think about, so I can't dwell on that. But fuck, man, that was close. That could have been it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:15:20.62" data-timestamp="920.62"> There's so many ways you can get hurt or die on a wildfire. Firefighters get cut by chainsaws, crushed by boulders, and into car wrecks on dirt roads. Little T was once in a fire where a plane accidentally dumped thousands of gallons of flame retardant on a firefighter from another crew, killing him.</p><p begin="00:15:43.73" data-timestamp="943.73">And then, earlier this season, a squad boss like Pete died while fighting the El Dorado fire in Southern California. The flames burned over him. Afterward, another member of the crew who'd been upset about his death went missing. Suicide and PTSD have risen among wildland firefighters.</p><p begin="00:16:03.37" data-timestamp="963.37">It feels like dumb luck that Pete hasn't seen a death on his own crew. He's in charge of a bunch of guys in their 20s. A lot of them are pretty new to this job. Pete can't stop worrying even when they're off the fire and get to go home. He says they've gotten injured and even died in car accidents, tired and in a rush to get home after a fire. I've heard a lot of firefighters talk about this is a problem. Pete says his wife Jen sometimes busts him for not being able to leave the guys back at work.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:16:33.39" data-timestamp="993.39"> Sometimes I get this blank stare. And then we're sitting on the couch, right? I don't watch TV, but Jen was watching TV. And she'll look at me. And right away, her question always is, are you thinking about work? Are you thinking about the guys?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:16:49.76" data-timestamp="1009.76"> [INAUDIBLE] what are you thinking, wanting a romantic answer, and you're like, I'm thinking about Frank. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:16:54.75" data-timestamp="1014.75"> Yeah, honestly, that does happen, you know? What are they doing right now? Like, oh, I wonder if do they need help. I don't want them to get hurt. I want to get back really.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:17:05.72" data-timestamp="1025.72"> I'm curious. Because you spend so much time with these guys, does it ever feel easier to be more like a dad to them than to your own children, who you don't get to see very often?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete Rosas</h4><p begin="00:17:18.61" data-timestamp="1038.61"> Yeah, definitely. I mean, I don't know how to answer that other than, yeah, it is like that, unfortunately, I guess. Because I do see sometimes a difference in how I treat everybody in my family and how I treat these guys sometimes. More understanding and more patient. We're literally stuck with each other for seven, eight months out of the year. If the guys get in an argument or are not seeing eye to eye, you can't just walk away. You have to deal with it at the moment, or it could potentially cost us our lives.</p><p begin="00:17:58.71" data-timestamp="1078.71">With the family, you walk away. And you'll come back a day later or whatever it be. With us, you can't. So I'm aware that it might be unfair. I'm 100% aware of that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:18:12.97" data-timestamp="1092.97"> Long fire seasons are now so consistent that there's a whole army of private contractors that chases these fires across California, too. It's a multimillion dollar industry. Their jobs are to make life a little easier for the people out on the fire line.</p><p begin="00:18:34.74" data-timestamp="1114.74">At the Creek Fire, most of these contractors are set up in the main parking lot of the ski resort, which is the equivalent of downtown here. There's hot showers, the sleep trailers-- they're highly sought after-- and an industrial kitchen that packs up these brown paper bag lunches called the 5,000 calorie meal. The mobile laundromat is in a white trailer in the back of the parking lot, hooked up to a water tank. It has 16 washers and dryers going all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenn Wolf</h4><p begin="00:18:59.48" data-timestamp="1139.48"> Is this one dirty, too?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Firefighter</h4><p begin="00:19:01.19" data-timestamp="1141.19"> Oh, yeah, right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:19:02.00" data-timestamp="1142"> Jenn Wolf is the person in charge of washing everyone's filthy laundry. She says Little T always texts her the second they get off the mountain, just so they can jump to the front of the line as soon as they roll back into camp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenn Wolf</h4><p begin="00:19:13.27" data-timestamp="1153.27"> Put a little detergent in there.

There's no real downtime.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:19:29.59" data-timestamp="1169.59"> Jenn wears blue latex gloves so she doesn't pick up poison oak.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:19:33.66" data-timestamp="1173.66"> Does it smell really bad when it comes in?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Jenn Wolf</h4><p begin="00:19:37.31" data-timestamp="1177.31"> It can. Some of these teams, what's called a spike out--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:19:41.68" data-timestamp="1181.68"> Spiking out means camping out in a remote spot near the fire line.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenn Wolf</h4><p begin="00:19:45.14" data-timestamp="1185.14"> And they spike out there for sometimes two weeks. And there's no laundry service, no shower. And yeah, their socks can stand on their own sometimes. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:19:55.48" data-timestamp="1195.48"> One of the guys who works for her was a lot less diplomatic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:19:59.49" data-timestamp="1199.49"> So if you go to this grocery store, you buy 12 eggs, you boil them, and now you leave them out for a month, that's what some of these clothes smell like.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:20:06.76" data-timestamp="1206.76"> The only snafu Jenn had here at camp was a sock mix-up. She accidentally put one firefighter's expensive wool socks in another guy's bags.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenn Wolf</h4><p begin="00:20:15.61" data-timestamp="1215.61"> And [LAUGHS] we were able to unite the socks first.

But we got them back to him, so all is good.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:20:31.47" data-timestamp="1231.47"> How long did the sock saga last?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jenn Wolf</h4><p begin="00:20:34.70" data-timestamp="1234.7"> Um, I think a couple of days. So yeah, it was very high stress. It's socks, but you know what? I'm telling you, that is the comforts. They were his socks. He wanted them back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:20:46.83" data-timestamp="1246.83"> The Creek is the fourth fire camp Jenn has worked at this year. She says the smoke in each of them smells really different. Here, it's like a campfire from all the smoldering pine trees. But in more populated areas where buildings and houses burn, the smoke smells synthetic and greasy. It stings your lungs. That reminded me of the fires I saw in wine country in 2017. More than 5,000 houses and buildings burned down. The smoke smelled awful because you were breathing in people's lives.</p><p begin="00:21:25.06" data-timestamp="1285.06">Kaylee Ralls has one of the most important jobs in the camp. She works in a trailer, printing the maps and action plans for all the teams. The printers run 24 hours a day, and Kaylee is the only person on her 12-hour shift, so she can't leave the trailer. People are constantly running in and out. They never have time to chat, which means that this person who everyone relies on is the loneliest person I met at camp.</p><p begin="00:21:48.22" data-timestamp="1308.22">The most exciting drama that had happened the week I was there was a black bear busting into a giant grease spot from the kitchen. The cook told me the bear had chugged about 100 gallons of grease. But as usual, that news hadn't reached Kaylee yet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:22:00.93" data-timestamp="1320.93"> Have you seen the bear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kaylee Ralls</h4><p begin="00:22:03.92" data-timestamp="1323.92"> The bear?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:22:04.52" data-timestamp="1324.52"> It's been eating the bacon grease.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kaylee Ralls</h4><p begin="00:22:06.88" data-timestamp="1326.88"> No way!

I'm all alone over here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:22:19.57" data-timestamp="1339.57"> Kaylee says the only time she leaves her trailer, called Firedog, is to go out to the porta potty. She's so isolated that she hasn't even figured out how to read the map she's printing. They're typographic and color-coded to show where the fire's the hottest, with symbols for all the different teams. At this point, the outline of the fire perimeter kind of looks like a Sasquatch with its front leg kicked out.</p><p begin="00:22:43.42" data-timestamp="1363.42">Kaylee's 20. She wears a hoodie and has perfect makeup. She recently broke up with her long time boyfriends.

I don't know if it's because they have nice uniforms, and they have to be really clean-like. It's nicer all around. Not only because there's cute boys, but because you get better food. It's like, if you're going to stay at this five star hotel compared to this three star type thing. So CAL FIRE is the five star hotel.

When I get back to the cabin, I FaceTime her, and we'll talk all night. And then I'm like, OK, let's set up our phones. And she's like, OK. So we literally fall asleep. If I open my eyes, I can look at my phone and see her. And I just wake up all throughout the night and look to see if she's still there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:25:15.32" data-timestamp="1515.32"> Does she sleep with the light on so that you can see her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kaylee Ralls</h4><p begin="00:25:19.04" data-timestamp="1519.04"> No, I sleep with the light on.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:25:30.55" data-timestamp="1530.55"> Kaylee is thinking about moving out of her cabin and into a tent at the camp, just so she doesn't have to feel so alone.</p><p begin="00:25:41.27" data-timestamp="1541.27">It can be weirdly easy to work on these wildfires and not think about the big picture at all. This year was a turning point. The combination of climate change, drought, dead and diseased trees and more housing built in high risk places. California saw six of the state's biggest fires in modern history. For the first time, firefighters began using the term giga fire to describe a million acres burning.</p><p begin="00:26:06.46" data-timestamp="1566.46">We still approach wildfires with a very manifest destiny type of attitude, believing that with enough people and grit, there's no fire we can't conquer. But we've spent four months and almost $200 million on the Creek Fire, and it's still not out. The Creek Fire destroyed 850 homes and businesses. Most of them were in little mountain towns, where nothing will be ever totally normal again, not even the ground. After a big fire, the dirt is toxic from melted insulation and all the other synthetic stuff inside a home when it burns down. And with the forest gutted, you can suddenly see for miles.</p><p begin="00:26:42.01" data-timestamp="1602.01">I talked to a bulldozer operator named Dean Mullis, who goes by Woody. He got a glimpse of this and was still thinking about it a few weeks after he'd gone home. On his very first shift on the Creek Fire, he was sent out to protect a neighborhood the fire hadn't reached yet. It was on Cressman Road. He'd never been here before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Woody</h4><p begin="00:26:59.53" data-timestamp="1619.53"> All of a sudden, there's just fire. You don't exactly know where to go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:27:05.02" data-timestamp="1625.02"> So he started pushing away anything that might cause the houses to catch fire.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Woody</h4><p begin="00:27:08.79" data-timestamp="1628.79"> I was basically in the bulldozer pushing cars that were on fire, playground sets, decks, like wooden decks, off the back of a house, brush, trees, kicking that fuel away from those houses.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:27:23.52" data-timestamp="1643.52"> He worked through the night. But most of the homes didn't survive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woody</h4><p begin="00:27:26.66" data-timestamp="1646.66"> And we'd drive through there, and we'd go, man, why did that one survive and the other one didn't? I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:27:31.45" data-timestamp="1651.45"> Woody is a dozer operator for the state's CAL FIRE agency. Unlike hotshot crews, he spends most of his time alone, moving huge piles of dirt in his dozer, scraping fuel breaks to get ahead of the flames. He jokes that the stereotype of a bulldozer operator is someone who's kind of salty and will push back against orders they don't agree with.</p><p begin="00:27:51.51" data-timestamp="1671.51">Woody's bald with piercing blue eyes. He says he hates what the big fire camps like the one at the Creek have become. Once upon a time, when Woody first started, the fire camp was just a few boots in a lot where you went to pick up your paycheck or radio.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:28:04.23" data-timestamp="1684.23"> You know, it's been a really long fire season. How are you feeling at this point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woody</h4><p begin="00:28:10.68" data-timestamp="1690.68"> I'm not going to-- I don't like it. I don't like it. I mean, it's too much. It's just devastation. You see all the comments on social media, the new norm in California. It sucks. I don't want to be running the bulldozer in December in Southern California, protecting structures. I mean, I will. It's my job. Of course, I will.</p><p begin="00:28:30.95" data-timestamp="1710.95">But I care for people a lot. And I don't enjoy seeing houses burn. Nobody wants to do that. People want to go to their-- it's the holidays. You're supposed to be staring at Ralphie from A Christmas Story, not staring at a wildfire.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:28:44.65" data-timestamp="1724.65"> I first met Woody in 2018 at another California fire, the Ferguson. It happened north of here. That year, at least six firefighters died. Two of them were dozer operators and included Woody's best friend from childhood. His name is Braden Varney, and he is the one who got Woody into firefighting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woody</h4><p begin="00:29:04.77" data-timestamp="1744.77"> It was dark. It was extremely steep. And his bulldozer slid off the side of a road, and he perished when it slid. It tumbled down the mountain.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:29:14.49" data-timestamp="1754.49"> It took two days for firefighters to retrieve Braden's body. They draped an American flag over his remains and carried him out of the canyon. Now Woody has Braden's job at their local fire station in Mariposa. He sees himself as part of the lineage of dozer operators, one that started with Braden's dad, who held the spot until he died of cancer from the job.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woody</h4><p begin="00:29:36.16" data-timestamp="1776.16"> Braden and I always wanted to be partners on the bulldozers. Braden will always be on my mind. Braden will always be with me on the fire lines in the morning, drinking coffee out of a plastic water bottle that's been cut in half out of a homemade coffee pot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:29:55.39" data-timestamp="1795.39"> Do you ever think about how much longer you can or want to do this job for?

They were about to get to go home for two days. They stood out from the rest of the scraggly and bearded dirty men in the parking lot. Everyone on Little T was showered, clean shaven. It's a crew tradition. In one of the buggies, the guys were watching a Dodgers game on a little TV.</p><p begin="00:31:17.73" data-timestamp="1877.73">They looked relaxed and happy, even though they just heard the fire season might get extended another two months into January. That's something that would have been hard to imagine a few years ago. Again, here's Zach and Frank. Like a lot of the crew, they're contractors who get laid off at the end of the season.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:31:34.86" data-timestamp="1894.86"> What do you think about the season possibly going all the way until January?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Hanson</h4><p begin="00:31:38.17" data-timestamp="1898.17"> It's so exciting.

It could be way steeper.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:32:22.19" data-timestamp="1942.19"> The truth is, a lot of people don't last more than a few years at this job. The adrenaline high eventually wears off, and they move on to other jobs, jobs that are easier on their families. One of the hardest parts of hotshotting is just how much they're on the road. More of their life is spent out at fires than at home.</p><p begin="00:32:40.11" data-timestamp="1960.11">This season, Little T has been on back-to-back assignments since June. Nevada, Utah, Arizona, all up and down California. The way their assignments work is they go out for 14 or 21 days at a time, then only get two days off before shipping out again. With all the overtime, it's good money. One of the chainsaw guys on the crew said he'd make 70,000 after taxes. So some of them don't really work during the off season.</p><p begin="00:33:06.46" data-timestamp="1986.46">While they're out fighting fires, life goes on without them. They're reminded of this in a very literal way. They often go without cell service for days. And then the second they get back in range, they're bombarded by everything they've missed. Joel Gonzales is one of the captains on Little T.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Joel Gonzales</h4><p begin="00:33:22.73" data-timestamp="2002.73"> Some guys, over 100 messages a day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lizzie Johnson</h4><p begin="00:33:26.66" data-timestamp="2006.66"> You're thinking of something.

But then he never makes it home to be able to do that. And now, it just turns into worse and worse and worse. And unfortunately, it doesn't work. It's really hard to understand or even sometimes believe that you're gone so long or believe that you're on a fire. Or why didn't you have service? Why didn't you have service? I just talked to you a minute ago. Well, yeah, I know, I was hiking, and I had service for one second, and now it's gone. And now they don't hear from you again for three, four days.

It becomes to where you become very catered to. Well, this is not normal. In real life, it's not like that. I mean, your kids are going to talk back. Your wife is going to want different things. It's going to be a different type of reaction. And somebody has been doing this so long, somebody like myself and a lot of these other guys.

So, the people in this act have been working at a task, some of them for years, and this has been in the news in just the last few weeks. They have actually succeeded. It looks like they got their boulder up to the top of the hill. David Kestenbaum spoke with four scientists who have been working on a coronavirus vaccine, one of the ones that was just shown to be effective. David was a scientist in his early career. He worked at Fermilab. And from the coverage, he could not understand what exactly they had done in any detail. And he wanted to know that and who these people were and, especially, how does it feel to have helped make a thing that could save so many lives, fix the global economy, get life back to normal again for everybody. Here's David.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:39:31.41" data-timestamp="2371.41"> I'm going to tell you of the story of some of the people who made this one tiny thing.

He said no one had really interviewed him about all that he had done. Nianshuang got himself a scholarship to one of the top universities. And the thing he found himself gravitating toward is this field called structural biology, which I think favors a particular kind of person. You're basically trying to figure out what molecules look like, where all the atoms are, so you can tell how something works, or if it's a virus, how to fight it.</p><p begin="00:41:12.00" data-timestamp="2472">And the thing is, people work for years trying to figure out the structure of one tiny molecule. The traditional way of doing it is that you get a bunch of those molecules and try to get them to lay out in a neat, repeating pattern. Then you hit them with these powerful X-rays, which give you just this pattern of dots. Then you have to apply these mathematical algorithms. And sometimes, it's just not solvable. It really is like pushing a boulder to the top of a hill. It rolls down over and over.</p><p begin="00:41:38.95" data-timestamp="2498.95">Nianshuang was good at it, though. For his thesis, he worked out the structure of part of a coronavirus. Not this coronavirus-- this was years ago. It was a coronavirus that was making the news back then, the MERS coronavirus, because it caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. After that, he needed a job, so he reached out to a guy who was also looking into MERS, Jason McClellan at Dartmouth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:41:59.69" data-timestamp="2519.69"> How would your friends describe you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Mclellan</h4><p begin="00:42:03.68" data-timestamp="2523.68"> Wow.

This was 2014, six years before the pandemic. They wanted to make a vaccine for MERS. And one of the things they were trying to figure out back then that would end up being key for the vaccine we have today was, how to manufacture copies of the tiny spikes that were all over the surface of the MERS coronavirus.</p><p begin="00:42:41.73" data-timestamp="2561.73">The spikes are why they're called the coronaviruses. The viruses have a corona, a wreath of these little spikes sticking out all over it. The spike is the part that sticks to your cells when it gets in your body, lets the virus break into your cells and start replicating. It's the scary part of the thing in a way. If they could make just the spikes without a deadly virus attached to them, maybe they could train your immune system to recognize the virus and fight it. But it turned out to be damn hard to make the spikes in the lab. Basically, you stick the genetic code for the spike into some cells.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:43:13.84" data-timestamp="2593.84"> What are the cells?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Mclellan</h4><p begin="00:43:15.21" data-timestamp="2595.21"> We used two, either CHO cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, or HEK293 cells.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:43:22.22" data-timestamp="2602.22"> Which are what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Mclellan</h4><p begin="00:43:23.49" data-timestamp="2603.49"> The Human Embryonic Kidney cells.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:43:26.88" data-timestamp="2606.88"> I see.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:43:27.81" data-timestamp="2607.81"> I don't know why I wanted to know all this, except that this is the kind of knowledge that is going to save our asses. The problem was when they got the genetic code for the spikes into those cells, they did start spitting out spikes. But the cells weren't making a lot of them. And the spikes on their own were unstable. They kept changing into the wrong shape. Nianshuang spent a long time trying to stabilize them. Add something, tweak the genetic code. Try again, again. There's a tedium to it. Each try takes a while.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="00:43:59.21" data-timestamp="2639.21"> Around two or three weeks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:44:00.61" data-timestamp="2640.61"> Two or three weeks.

Lots of little, precise steps. You mix the stuff up in a flask, set it on this little platform which gently swirls the stuff in it, keep the whole thing at 37 degrees Celsius, leave it overnight. So you're constantly having to be at the lab at a certain time to do the next step. His wife told him, "You always say it'll be five minutes, but it's hours."</p><p begin="00:45:30.54" data-timestamp="2730.54">They tried so many different things, scouring the scientific literature for different ideas, modifying them. The thing that finally worked was changing the genetic code for the spike so it would swap into prolene amino acids. They helped hold the spike in its spike form, kept it from changing shape. Also, the cells were spitting out way more spikes-- 50 times more.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Mclellan</h4><p begin="00:45:51.30" data-timestamp="2751.3"> The day it worked was really exciting because Nianshuang, who'd been doing all of this work, it's a lot of trial and error.

We knew we had something then.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:46:04.59" data-timestamp="2764.59"> When they vaccinated mice, gave them a shot containing these MERS coronavirus spikes, the mice's little immune systems developed antibodies-- lots of them. It looked really promising, like you might be able to make a really good vaccine against the MERS coronavirus. This was basically the road map for the vaccine we were all going to need when the pandemic started. But the major scientific journals were not interested in publishing it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="00:46:29.05" data-timestamp="2789.05"> We totally tried six different journals, and it was rejected five times.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:46:34.89" data-timestamp="2794.89"> Wow, that's kind of amazing looking back now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="00:46:38.56" data-timestamp="2798.56"> Yeah, if we look back, yeah.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:46:50.18" data-timestamp="2810.18"> He told me he fell into a real depression. No one seemed to see the value of their work. He saw a therapist, who pointed out all he had accomplished and suggested that he might feel proud instead of sad. It didn't really help. This was 2017. The pandemic was three years away. The fact that they had trouble getting it published, to me, it doesn't mean the scientific journal editors are idiots. Back then, most people thought the next pandemic was going to be some new form of influenza, not a coronavirus, which, of course, is the argument for funding lots of basic research. Sometimes you don't know what thing is going to be important.</p><p begin="00:47:33.45" data-timestamp="2853.45">When the current pandemic began, Jason McLellan had moved his lab from Dartmouth to the University of Texas at Austin. Nianshuang had gone with him. Jason told me one day in January, January 6th, he was in Utah snowboarding, and he got a call from the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, Barney Graham. Graham had been working with him on all the MERS coronavirus stuff, and he was calling about some pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China. The local health authority was reporting 41 cases.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Mclellan</h4><p begin="00:48:05.18" data-timestamp="2885.18"> He let me know he was talking with the US CDC, and they wanted to quickly make a vaccine candidate. And it looked like it was a beta coronavirus. And he wanted to know, are we game? Are we going to-- can we help out try to rapidly determine the structure of the spike and get the vaccine made? And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:23.83" data-timestamp="2903.83"> You said, I'm busy, I'm snowboarding.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Mclellan</h4><p begin="00:48:26.11" data-timestamp="2906.11"> Yeah, I was actually-- I was getting some boots heat molded, so I had 10 minutes to talk to him while they were heat molding to my feet. But I immediately WhatsApped my grad student, Daniel Rapp, and told him, we're going to race. We got to move quickly on this. Let's get prepared.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:39.33" data-timestamp="2919.33"> It's worth pointing out, they were running full steam at this in January. This is before Wuhan went into lockdown, before that giant hospital got built. The whole thing was barely in the news. And life here, it was totally normal. So they were all going to the office to work frantically on this thing, while, all around them, people are going to restaurants and church. Kids are in school.</p><p begin="00:49:02.52" data-timestamp="2942.52">The thing they were going to try to help make is called an mRNA vaccine. Instead of giving people shots filled with coronavirus spikes, you inject people with the genetic code for making the spikes. The code is wrapped in this little package. And once it gets injected into your body, it goes into your cells. And then your cells start making the spikes-- loads of them, which, on their own, are harmless. But your immune system sees these foreign things and learns to fight it, which should hopefully protect you if the real virus comes along.</p><p begin="00:49:34.34" data-timestamp="2974.34">This is the genius of vaccines. We're not that good at making drugs against viruses. But you know what's really good at fighting them? Our immune system. If you can just show it the right piece of the virus, it often figures out how to fight it off. It's like the answer we all have inside us.</p><p begin="00:49:53.18" data-timestamp="2993.18">The big thing they had to work out for the vaccine was what part of the genetic sequence for the coronavirus were they going to stick in the vaccine to make the spikes. And how were they going to alter that code so that when the spike was created, it would be stable and not twist around? Five days after Jason got that phone call, Chinese researchers posted the genetic code for the new coronavirus online so teams around the world could look at it. Jason and the others started going through it right away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:50:23.13" data-timestamp="3023.13"> So how long did it take?

And also, when the Nobel prizes were announced, she would write the speeches she would imagine they would deliver and read them out loud, pretending to deliver them in a very dramatic way with tears, as if they were the Oscars or something.

Kizzmekia remembers at some point going to see her family, sitting down on her mom's bed, and kind of briefing everyone. "I think things might really change soon. I think the virus is about to be a big problem." I talked to all the researchers about what it was like in this period, making and testing a vaccine they hoped would work, but not knowing. Meanwhile, more and more of the world was shutting down, more people getting sick and dying. Kizzmekia told me she used to look at the daily numbers for the world and then had to stop. It wasn't healthy.</p><p begin="00:53:55.23" data-timestamp="3235.23">Barney Graham is Kizzmekia's boss. He is the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the NIH and the guy who called Jason while he was snowboarding. He'd worked with them on all of this stuff, the most senior member of the group. It weighed on him, though he didn't always recognize it. He says he's not always in touch with his feelings. We talked in the evening, and he was at home where he had been for months. Sitting in front of a bookcase, a little bust of Benjamin Franklin on it, he seemed tired.

There were so many things the president needed to be doing to tame the pandemic. Why was he wasting his time with this? And then-- maybe you remember this-- there was a story in the news back then about how the FBI was looking into whether Chinese spies working through the consulate in Houston had tried to steal vaccine research. The FBI was going to be questioning people at the University of Texas. One story included Nianshuang's name as someone who worked there from China. Friends told him to get a lawyer. He says he and his wife looked into whether they could leave the country if they needed to. In the end, no one came to question him, but it was unnerving.</p><p begin="00:57:54.35" data-timestamp="3474.35">The moment when all these researchers learned that their vaccine was going to work was a few weeks ago when Pfizer announced that its vaccine was more than 90% effective. Pfizer had started its phase three clinical trials on the same day as them, but Pfizer got its results first. Pfizer had used in its vaccine the thing this team had come up with, the coronavirus spike stabilized the way they had figured out. Pfizer had licensed it from them. So if the Pfizer vaccine worked, they figured theirs would, too.

It was the cry you might expect to have if you won the lottery.</p><p begin="01:00:39.32" data-timestamp="3639.32">I don't even know if my family even today understands what just happened with me over the last year. If I were to call them about 90% efficacy results, they'd be like, OK, what is that? I actually still haven't communicated with my family about the efficacy results at all. I talk to them all the time. I just talked to my dad this morning about fixing a dishwasher in my rental property, so I talk to them all the time. But I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="01:01:17.80" data-timestamp="3677.8"> Yeah, it feels, oh, God, it's actually working now. So it's really going to save a lot of people. So I think I'm proud of it. And it's great.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:01:32.29" data-timestamp="3692.29"> That little thing you made might fix the global economy. It could save millions of lives. It could help everything get back to normal, that little thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="01:01:44.87" data-timestamp="3704.87"> Yeah, that's what I hope. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:01:48.69" data-timestamp="3708.69"> What do your parents say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="01:01:52.03" data-timestamp="3712.03"> My parents, actually, they don't know what I was doing. They just know, oh, you developed a vaccine. That's great. [LAUGHS] That's their thinking. They don't know how much contribution I did. Yeah, actually, they-- yeah, my mom got stroke several years ago. She may never know what I'm doing now, so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:02:12.65" data-timestamp="3732.65"> I'm sorry about your mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nianshuang Wang</h4><p begin="01:02:19.58" data-timestamp="3739.58"> Yeah, I'm a little sad about that. But they had encouraged a lot in the past, yeah. I will always remember those things, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:02:30.42" data-timestamp="3750.42"> It can be hard, I think, when you're in deep with something complicated to explain that thing to someone on the outside, particularly with science. There's this version that often makes it out into the world of a single person having a clear, dramatic breakthrough-- Jonas Salk with the polio vaccine. The Nobel Prize is always given to one or a few people. But a lot of science isn't like that. I think most of it isn't.</p><p begin="01:02:58.00" data-timestamp="3778">When I asked Jason McClellan, the other scientist in this story, about his contribution to this, he started listing names, all the people whose work went before or whose ideas they adapted. Kizzmekia, when she gives talks, her last slides are just lists of names. It's never just one person pushing the rock up a hill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:03:21.14" data-timestamp="3801.14"> David Kestenbaum is senior editor of our show. The NIH Moderna vaccine protected 94% of the people who got it in clinical trial. It was just this week approved for emergency use. The government has arranged to purchase 200 million doses.</p><p begin="01:03:38.75" data-timestamp="3818.75">[MUSIC - "ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER" BY EMILIE AUTUMN]</p></div> </div>

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:03:48.86" data-timestamp="3828.86">Well, our program was produced today by Lilly Sullivan. The people who put our show together today include Dana Chivvis, Aviva DeKornfeld, Noor Gill, Hilary Elkins, Damien Graves, Seth Lind, Miki Meek, Stowe Nelson, Katherine Rae Mondo, Nadia Reiman, Robyn Semien, Alissa Shipp, Christopher Swetala, Matt Tierney, Julie Whitaker, and Diane Wu. Our managing editor is Sarah Abdurrahman. Our senior editor is David Kestenbaum. Our executive editor, Emanuele Berry.</p><p begin="01:04:14.99" data-timestamp="3854.99">Special thanks today to Derek Lowe, Daniel Patterson, Pedro Marron, Adan Luna, Chuck Ramirez, Ryan Mendoza, Jenn Rosas, JB Bunton, Thea Phimmasy, Miguel Diaz, Gilbert Mendoza, Francisco Murillo, Forrest Lamp, John Clearwater, and Christina Crawford. Our website where we set up a special page to note our show's 25th year on the air with a list of favorite shows from over the years and have written little blurbs explaining why each of the shows made the list, plus award-winning shows and spinoff shows, that's thisamericanlife.org/25years. Again, thisamericanlife.org/25years.</p><p begin="01:04:46.15" data-timestamp="3886.15">This American Life is delivered to public radio stations by PRX, the Public Radio Exchange. Thanks, as always, to our program's confounder, Mr. Torey Malatia. You know, we were arguing over the greatest daytime TV talk shows of all time. I personally have always been a fan of Oprah. Torey disagreed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kaylee Ralls</h4><p begin="01:05:04.97" data-timestamp="3904.97"> The View is great, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:05:06.27" data-timestamp="3906.27"> I'm Ira Glass.
