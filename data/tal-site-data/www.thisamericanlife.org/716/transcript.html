<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.79" data-timestamp="0.79"> When Lucian Truscott tries to explain how he's related to Thomas Jefferson, he says, OK, he's 73. He used to visit a great grandmother, who used to visit her great grandfather, Thomas Jefferson's grandson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:00:13.58" data-timestamp="13.58"> So there was only-- when I was growing up, when I visited my great grandmother, there was only one dead person between me and Jefferson.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:21.25" data-timestamp="21.25"> When Lucian was a boy in the early 1950s, just six or seven years old, when he would visit family in Charlottesville, sometimes they would drop him off with his brother at Monticello, Jefferson's home. Lucian says it was before the place had been remade for tourists like it is today. Basically, visitors who pay maybe $1 and walk through the house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:00:37.89" data-timestamp="37.89"> You know, my great aunts, they treated the place like it was still the family home. And we had the run of the place. We used to fill our pockets full of pebbles from the walkways up there, and go up on the second floor and third floor of the place and crawl out windows onto these parapets that are up around the top of Monticello and drop pebbles on the tourists that were walking around the house. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.44" data-timestamp="66.44"> Very asocial behavior.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:01:08.10" data-timestamp="68.1"> Yeah. And you're talking to one of-- probably the only person you'll ever talk to in your life that's actually jumped on Thomas Jefferson's bed. I mean, we would play on the bed. We'd go through that little doorway and up the stairs into the closet, which is above the bed there, and sit up there in the closet. And when tourists came through the room, we'd stick our faces out of the window up there and say boo and scare them. We'd hide out there. And so--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.65" data-timestamp="98.65"> There was no adult supervision at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:01:40.61" data-timestamp="100.61"> No, no adult supervision at all.</p><p begin="00:01:49.68" data-timestamp="109.68">We went through all the bedrooms and stuff up there. And then, of course, we'd play down in the basement rooms. And then of course what they call the dependencies, which were the slave rooms that run under the two wings that run out from Monticello itself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:07.28" data-timestamp="127.28"> It would be decades before the slave quarters were part of the Monticello tour, Lucian says. These were just empty rooms under the house. No furniture or anything else in them. He and his brother would explore and run around.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:02:18.63" data-timestamp="138.63"> And play hide and seek or whatever little boys did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:24.27" data-timestamp="144.27"> It's amazing to me the degree to which it felt like a family home. Did it feel that way to you as a kid?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:02:30.34" data-timestamp="150.34"> You know, I have to tell you that all of this stuff in my family was just taken for granted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:37.81" data-timestamp="157.81"> These days, of course, nothing about the legacies of the Founding Fathers is taken for granted. Just this week, a special committee appointed by the mayor of Washington, DC called for removing, relocating, or contextualizing a bunch of monuments to slave-owning Founding Fathers, including the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument, which, by the way, the mayor doesn't actually have jurisdiction over.</p><p begin="00:02:59.71" data-timestamp="179.71">Meanwhile, the president, of course, has put his arms around this issue. Right after he began his reelection campaign, he gave a speech at Mount Rushmore to make clear that he does not want to remove any monuments or rename any buildings or military bases.</p><p begin="00:03:11.21" data-timestamp="191.21">But this great, great, great-- whatever it is-- direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson, Lucian Truscott, he's got a special perspective on this. He led the charge to convince all the other white descendants of Thomas Jefferson to allow the Black descendants of Thomas Jefferson into their official family association.</p><p begin="00:03:27.04" data-timestamp="207.04">The Black family members, of course, trace back to Jefferson and Sally Hemings, one of the people he enslaved. Lucian thinks that everybody needs to get real about the slave-owning past of some of the Founding Fathers.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:38.66" data-timestamp="218.66"> Like, how do you feel about people taking down monuments of Thomas Jefferson?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lucian Truscott</h4><p begin="00:03:42.03" data-timestamp="222.03"> I think they ought to be taken down. I think that the great monument to Thomas Jefferson is Monticello. And I think it's an appropriate monument, because it actually puts Jefferson's life in context. It puts his slave-owning as part of his life and in context. If you visit Monticello today, you get to see where the slaves lived. You'll be shown where Sally Hemings's brother John did woodwork in Jefferson's bedroom, and study, and so forth.</p><p begin="00:04:14.34" data-timestamp="254.34">Slaves built that place. I never heard that slaves built that place when I was growing up. But it's talked about today. The history of Monticello at this point is about half Jefferson history, half slave history. I think that's appropriate. As a memorial, it tells the story of the whole man, not just this sort of god-like Thomas Jefferson we've all been raised to venerate.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:49.25" data-timestamp="289.25"> What are we supposed to do with the shameful parts of America's past? This is being talked about so much today. And back in the early days of our radio show, in the late '90s, one of our contributors, Sarah Vowell, did a story that took that on in this very vivid and complicated way.</p><p begin="00:05:04.05" data-timestamp="304.05">She set out on the road with her sister Amy to visit the site of a historic tragedy, one that involved part of their own family 160 years before that. And we wanted to replay it this holiday weekend because the questions that it addresses, the things that it is obsessed with, are all so much more talked about today than 22 years ago when she did that story.</p><p begin="00:05:25.26" data-timestamp="325.26">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. We take a road trip into history today. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:38.97" data-timestamp="338.97"> So Sarah Vowell and her sister Amy were born in eastern Oklahoma, in what was called Indian Territory before statehood. That's where our story ends, and that's also where it begins. They're enrolled citizens of the Cherokee Nation, like their parents, which, as you'll hear, is important to this story.</p><p begin="00:05:54.05" data-timestamp="354.05">Here's the opening line of Sarah's story from 1998.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:05:57.47" data-timestamp="357.47"> Being at least a little Cherokee in northeastern Oklahoma is about as rare and remarkable as being a Michael Jordan fan in Chicago. I mean, who isn't?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:07.76" data-timestamp="367.76"> I'm guessing I don't need to explain that antique 1998 sports reference to many of you, but I do have one note before we play the rest of the story. And it's about the word "Injun." Sarah asked me to point out to anyone hearing this today that her grandfather was born in Indian Territory before statehood. And he used the word "Injun" as a term of affection. It was never derogatory. OK, so picking up, Sarah's part Cherokee.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:06:31.22" data-timestamp="391.22"> It goes without saying that my twin sister Amy is, too, except that I have dark eyes and dark hair, and she's a blue-eyed blonde. And so our grandfather nicknamed me Injun and her Swede.</p><p begin="00:06:43.73" data-timestamp="403.73">Here's Amy's take on all this. I must point out that while my sister and I don't really look alike, we sound almost exactly alike. A hint for listening to this story, I'm usually the grouchy one. Here's Amy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Vowell</h4><p begin="00:06:57.71" data-timestamp="417.71"> I mean, those roles were assigned to us, you know, Indian and Swede, because of the way we looked. But it was also more like the things we were told about ourselves, and she was the one who was given the Cherokee language book. And I was the one who was always told how much alike I was to our Swedish grandmother. And I think I was probably 6 or 7 or something before I realized that I was Cherokee, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:07:39.14" data-timestamp="459.14"> We're a little French, and Scottish, and English, and Seminole, too. Typical American mutts. But the Cherokee and Swedish sides of the family were the only genealogies anyone knew anything about. Here's what we knew about ourselves.</p><p begin="00:07:54.35" data-timestamp="474.35">Ellis Island, Trail of Tears. And I think, to a kid, Trail of Tears, the Cherokees' forced march from the East to Oklahoma, where we were born, seemed enormously more interesting, just as a name. Even the smallest children know what tears mean. And I think in my earliest understanding of where I came from, I pictured myself descended from a long line of weepers with bloodshot eyes.</p><p begin="00:08:21.41" data-timestamp="501.41">The Trail of Tears. Between 1838 and '39, the US army wrenched 16,000 people from their homes, rounded them up in stockades, and marched them across the country. 4,000 died.</p><p begin="00:08:37.47" data-timestamp="517.47">Every summer when we were children, our parents would drive us to a place about half an hour from where we lived called Tsa-La-Gi, which is the Cherokee word for "Cherokee." Tsa-La-Gi is the tribe's cultural center. There's a recreated village, a museum. And this was our favorite part, an amphitheater which staged a dramatic recreation of the Trail of Tears.</p><p begin="00:08:58.86" data-timestamp="538.86">Every summer, we watched Chief John Ross try like mad to save the Cherokee land back East. We saw his hothead rival, Stand Watie, rage off to the Civil War. We especially loved the Death of the Phoenix, a noisy, magenta-lit, interpretive dance in which the mythic bird would die only to rise again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Amy Vowell</h4><p begin="00:09:20.32" data-timestamp="560.32"> We would get these programs or brochures, and Sarah was kind of in charge of them. And sometimes she'd let me look at them. She had a whole little file, and we would look through them. And it was-- I mean, I did take it to heart. It was a story that was really tragic. I have a reverent feeling towards it.

And in the early 19th century, they launched a series of initiatives directly imitating the new American republic. In one decade, they created a written language, started a free press, ratified a constitution, and founded a capital city.</p><p begin="00:13:17.36" data-timestamp="797.36">New Echota was that capital.

To call it the Cherokee version of Washington, DC is entirely applicable, given the form of government the tribe established there. They ratified a constitution based on that of the United States, dividing into legislative, judicial, and executive branches. Its preamble begins "we, the representatives of the people of the Cherokee Nation, in convention assembled in order to establish justice, ensure tranquility, promote our common welfare, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of liberty."</p><p begin="00:14:20.72" data-timestamp="860.72">Unlike Washington, New Echota is cool, and quiet, and green.

It's peaceful, and it's right for the-- the atmosphere is right for what was going on in the story that we tell here. It's a story that's sad in a lot of ways, but there was a lot of great things happening with the Cherokee Nation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:14:55.10" data-timestamp="895.1"> The Cherokee, along with the other southeastern tribes who suffered removal to Oklahoma-- the Chickasaw, the Creek, the Choctaw, the Seminole-- are one of the so-called five civilized tribes.</p><p begin="00:15:07.38" data-timestamp="907.38">It was in 1822 that the Cherokee hero, Sequoyah, developed an alphabet, inventing the sole written language of any North American tribe. Only six years later, Cherokee editor Elias Boudinot founded <i>The</i> <i>Cherokee</i> <i>Phoenix,</i> a bilingual English-Cherokee newspaper published at New Echota.</p><p begin="00:15:28.09" data-timestamp="928.09">Many Cherokee, especially the mixed bloods, practiced Christianity. And because many of these lived as civilized, Southern gentlemen of the early 19th century, they owned prospering plantations, which meant they owned Black slaves.</p><p begin="00:15:44.24" data-timestamp="944.24">More than any other Native American tribe, the Cherokees adopted the religious, cultural, and political ideals of the United States, partly as a means to self-preservation.</p><p begin="00:15:56.06" data-timestamp="956.06">By becoming more like the Americans, they hoped to coexist with this new nation that was growing up around them. They weren't allowed to.</p><p begin="00:16:10.66" data-timestamp="970.66">Georgia settlers wanted their land and their gold, which was discovered near New Echota in 1829.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Gomez</h4><p begin="00:16:18.17" data-timestamp="978.17"> They were really progressing so fast at this time period. The printing operation was going with their newspaper here. Things were moving so fast for them for a short while here that it looked very promising. But because of gold and the big demand for the land, their fate had already been really sealed for them in earlier years.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:16:45.07" data-timestamp="1005.07"> The tribe allowed Christian missionaries to live and work among them and to teach their children English. The most beloved of these was the Presbyterian Samuel Worcester, who built a two-story house at New Echota, which functioned as a post office, school, and rooming house. It's still there, and David Gomez walks us through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Gomez</h4><p begin="00:17:03.83" data-timestamp="1023.83"> We've got some steep steps here.

Samuel Worcester refused to apply for such a permit, arguing that he had the permission of the Cherokee to live on their lands and that should suffice.</p><p begin="00:17:43.14" data-timestamp="1063.14">Georgia arrested Worcester and imprisoned him for four years. Worcester appealed to the Supreme Court, and the case <i>Worcester</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Georgia</i> became a great victory for the tribe. The court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that the Cherokee Nation was just that-- a sovereign nation within the borders of the US, and therefore beholden only to the federal government, i.e. not under the jurisdiction of Georgia State laws.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Gomez</h4><p begin="00:18:12.45" data-timestamp="1092.45"> And the Cherokee Nation was elated. They thought, all right, the highest court in the land of the United States, this government that we're trying to copy, they've ruled in our favor. This is gonna be good.</p><p begin="00:18:23.75" data-timestamp="1103.75">And of course Andrew Jackson, who was pro-removal from the early years-- he had campaigned on that issue-- decided he wasn't gonna back the Supreme Court ruling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:18:33.27" data-timestamp="1113.27"> Think about that, what that means. Jackson is violating his own oath of office to uphold the Constitution.</p><p begin="00:18:45.31" data-timestamp="1125.31">Anyway, the state of Georgia was thrilled when Jackson thumbed his nose at the court, and immediately dispatched teams to survey the Cherokee lands for a land lottery. Soon white settlers arrived here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Gomez</h4><p begin="00:18:57.82" data-timestamp="1137.82"> They show up two years later in 1834 with a land lottery deed, and with Georgia soldiers saying, I've got this land from the lottery. Get off of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:19:11.19" data-timestamp="1151.19"> One small constitutional violation that was part of the land grab, Georgia seized the Cherokee printing press, so they couldn't publicize their cause and win political support in states up North. The tribe was divided about what to do. Stay and fight, or demand cash for the land and head West? No one exploited this split more than Andrew Jackson. And no one annoyed Jackson like principal Chief John Ross.</p><p begin="00:19:39.55" data-timestamp="1179.55">Ross was a Jeffersonian figure in almost every sense. A Founding Father of the Cherokee nation in its modern legal form, he preached to liberty while owning slaves. An educated gentleman planter, he was their chief from 1827 to 1866.</p><p begin="00:19:58.06" data-timestamp="1198.06">In his later years, he corresponded with Abraham Lincoln. In his early years, he was such a believer in the inherent justice of the American system that he lobbied relentlessly in Washington, DC, believing that once the Congress and the president understood that the Cherokee were a virtuous, sibling republic that they'd treat the tribe fairly, as equals.</p><p begin="00:20:25.25" data-timestamp="1225.25">Once the state of Georgia began evicting the Cherokee, and John Ross among them, Ross wrote, "treated like dogs, we find ourselves fugitives, vagrants, and strangers in our own country."</p><p begin="00:20:44.59" data-timestamp="1244.59">The vast majority of the tribe wanted to stay put and supported Ross, but around 100 men, including <i>Phoenix</i> editor Elias Boudinot and his brother Stand Watie, 100 in a tribe of 16,000, met at Boudinot's house in New Echota and signed a treaty with the US government.</p><p begin="00:21:03.94" data-timestamp="1263.94">They had no authority to do this. Called the Treaty of New Echota, it relinquished all Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi in exchange for land in the West. They figured, Georgia was already seizing Cherokee land. This might be the only way the Cherokee could get something for it.</p><p begin="00:21:22.58" data-timestamp="1282.58">John Ross, whom the Georgia militia arrested so that he could not protest, was stunned. He accused the treaty party of treason. The rest of the 16,000 Cherokee signed a petition calling the treaty invalid and illegal. Congress ratified the treaty by only one vote, despite impassioned pleas on behalf of the Cherokee by senators Henry Clay and Davy Crockett. The tribe was given three years to remove themselves to the West.</p><p begin="00:21:55.49" data-timestamp="1315.49">Now we're standing at the side of Elias Boudinot's house, where the infamous New Echota treaty was signed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Gomez</h4><p begin="00:22:01.75" data-timestamp="1321.75"> When the spring of '38 rolled around, about like right now, nobody was going anywhere. Georgia and the federal government thought they were gonna have some problems, and you had about 7,000 troops come in to forcibly remove the Cherokees from their farms, from their houses, and initially rounded up in what were known as forts or stockades, and then moved up into eastern Tennessee and northeastern Alabama to three immigration depots, where they were then transferred and then moved out on the Trail of Tears, as everybody knows it.</p><p begin="00:22:30.06" data-timestamp="1350.06">So technically this is the starting point for the Trail of Tears. For the individual Cherokees, it really started at their front door or wherever they were rounded up from, though.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:22:39.27" data-timestamp="1359.27"> Amy and I want to step on it, this patch of grass where the treaty was signed, but we hesitate. It's not a grave, Gomez tells us, but that's what it feels like. We tiptoe onto it, this profane ground. And then we tiptoe away.</p><p begin="00:23:01.65" data-timestamp="1381.65">Perhaps we should be embarrassed by certain discrepancies between our Trail of Tears and theirs. We're weak, we're decadent, we're Americans, which means road trip history buffs one minute, amnesiacs the next. We want to remember, except when we want to forget.</p><p begin="00:23:19.63" data-timestamp="1399.63"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:23:27.70" data-timestamp="1407.7"> We register at the Chattanooga Choo Choo, the Chattanooga Choo Choo. It's a hotel now, a gloriously hokey, beautifully restored Holiday Inn, in which the lobby is the ornate dome of the old train station, and the rooms are turn-of-the-century rail cars parked out on the tracks.</p><p begin="00:23:46.17" data-timestamp="1426.17">We're in giggles the entire night for the simple reason that the phrase "choo choo" is completely addictive. We try to work it into every sentence. "What should we do for dinner? Stay here at the Choo Choo?" We end up going out for barbecue saying, "this is good, but I can't wait to get back to the Choo Choo."</p><p begin="00:24:03.27" data-timestamp="1443.27">We watched <i>The</i> <i>X-Files</i> in our train car commenting, "is it just me, or is this show even better in the Choo Choo?" I sent email from my laptop just so that I can write, "Greetings from the Chattanooga Choo Choo," exclamation point. Number of times I just said "Choo Choo? Seven. Number of Choos? 14.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:24:23.05" data-timestamp="1463.05"> Chattanooga Choo Choo!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:24:32.70" data-timestamp="1472.7"> Day two. Sadly, we check out of the Choo Choo and drive across town to Ross's Landing. It used to be where John Ross's ferry service carried people across the Tennessee River. But in 1838, it was one of the starting points for the water route of the Trail of Tears.</p><p begin="00:24:50.74" data-timestamp="1490.74">I stand on the sand and read a weathered historical marker.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:24:54.82" data-timestamp="1494.82"> "Established about 1816 by John Ross some 370 yards east of this point. It consisted of a ferry, warehouse, and landing. Cherokee parties left from the landing for the West in 1838, the same year the growing community took the name Chattanooga." And I'm sure there's no connection at all between those two points. That sounds so nice. They "left for the West." Bye-bye. Bon voyage.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:25:26.57" data-timestamp="1526.57"> I haven't mentioned that Ross's Landing also functions as Chattanooga's tourist center. Up the hill from the river is the gigantic Tennessee Aquarium and an IMAX theater. The place is crawling with tourists, a crowd so generic and distinguishable from one another they swirled around us as a single t-shirt.</p><p begin="00:25:49.37" data-timestamp="1549.37">160 years ago, thousands of Cherokees came through this site. In the summer, they were forced onto boats and faced heat exhaustion and a drought that stranded them without water to drink. In the fall, they headed west by foot, eventually trudging barefoot through blizzards.</p><p begin="00:26:06.56" data-timestamp="1566.56">Either way, they died of starvation, dysentery, diarrhea, and fatigue. A quarter of the tribe was gone. And here, in the shadow of the aquarium, the Trail of Tears is remembered by a series of quotations from disgruntled Native Americans carved into a concrete plaza.</p><p begin="00:26:25.07" data-timestamp="1585.07">One of the citations from a Cherokee named Dragging Canoe is from 1776.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:26:31.31" data-timestamp="1591.31"> "The white men have almost surrounded us, leaving us only a little spot of ground to stand upon. And it seems to be their intention to destroy us as a nation." Good call. We're moving diagonally across the sidewalk. And Andrew Jackson, in 1820, "It is high time to do away with the farce of treating with Indian tribes as separate nations." We'll step on that one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Amy Vowell</h4><p begin="00:27:01.05" data-timestamp="1621.05"> These cracks in the sidewalks, they are symbolic of broken promises.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:27:08.73" data-timestamp="1628.73"> Are you making that up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Amy Vowell</h4><p begin="00:27:10.25" data-timestamp="1630.25"> No, it says right here, some of the pavers are cracked to symbolize the broken promises made to the Indians.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:27:17.44" data-timestamp="1637.44"> Hmm.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:27:18.74" data-timestamp="1638.74"> Most Americans have had this experience.

Because in a democracy, we're all responsible for everything our government does.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:27:53.27" data-timestamp="1673.27"> This is the letter from Ralph Waldo Emerson to President Martin van Buren in 1838. "A crime is projected that confounds our understandings by its magnitude, a crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokee of a country.</p><p begin="00:28:09.92" data-timestamp="1689.92">For how could we call the conspiracy that should crush these poor Indians our government or the land that was coerced by their parting and dying imprecations our country anymore?</p><p begin="00:28:21.01" data-timestamp="1701.01">You, sir, will bring down the renowned chair in which you sit into infamy if your seal is set to this instrument of perfidy, and the name of this nation, hitherto the sweet omen of religion and liberty, will stink to the world."</p><p begin="00:28:37.25" data-timestamp="1717.25">And the path ends with a quotation from an unknown survivor of the Trail of Tears, who said, "long time we travel on way to new land. People feel bad when they leave old nation. Womens cry and make sad wails. Children and many men and all look sad like when friends die, but they say nothing and just put heads down and keep on go towards West. Many days pass, and people die very much. We bury close by trail."</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:29:13.89" data-timestamp="1753.89"> That last passage, especially the part about when friends die, bring us to tears.

We sort of hate them for a second. We ask a teacher who's with a group of fourth graders why she isn't talking to them about Cherokee history. And she says, normally she would, but it's the end of the school year, and this trip is their reward for being good. It sounds reasonable.

We plod through most of Missouri, stopping at yet another Trail of Tears State Park. There's actually a name for what we're doing. It's called heritage tourism, which sounds so grand, like it's gonna be one freaking epiphany after another. But after a while, we just read the signs without even getting out of the car.
