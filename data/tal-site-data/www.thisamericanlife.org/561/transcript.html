<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.67" data-timestamp="0.67">Today, we have this story for you about cars-- American cars. And like a lot of stories about American cars, this one is more tragedy than comedy, although there is some comedy in there, too. The good news, of course, about American cars is that American cars are getting better, especially in the last few years. You've probably heard that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle Krebs</h4><p begin="00:00:16.53" data-timestamp="16.53">Well, at Ford, the Ford Fusion-- <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> named it a better car than the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord a few years ago. I think that was a major turning point.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:28.74" data-timestamp="28.74">Michelle Krebs has been covering the auto industry for 35 years. She's now at autotrader.com. She says the reason American cars finally improved--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle Krebs</h4><p begin="00:00:36.93" data-timestamp="36.93">I think when you're on the brink of possible extinction, it wakes people up, and they started changing things. But that's what it took. I mean, that's why Ford came out with the Ford Fusion. They spent $23 billion-- borrowed $23 billion, because they were almost out of business.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:58.35" data-timestamp="58.35">So basically, it's deathbed conversions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michelle Krebs</h4><p begin="00:01:01.11" data-timestamp="61.11">That's a good way to describe it. They decided, we have got to bet the ranch on building great cars that people really want to buy. They're still not all the way there yet. I mean, I think that's the simple fact of the matter. There's been progress, but it's been spotty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:18.53" data-timestamp="78.53">How spotty? When <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> rated the top 10 most reliable car brands this year, only one was American. 9 were foreign. 4 of the top 5, no surprise, were Japanese-- Toyota, Honda, Mazda, and Lexus.</p><p begin="00:01:32.99" data-timestamp="92.99">Why are most American cars still not as good as foreign cars? Why is it still taking Detroit so long to learn this lesson? It's not like this reliability problem just snuck up on them, right?</p><p begin="00:01:44.76" data-timestamp="104.76">General Motors, the biggest American car maker, started losing market share 50 years ago. Back in the 1960s, GM sold over half the cars in the United States, and then that number just slid lower and lower and lower for decades, until now, it's 18% of all cars sold in the US.</p><p begin="00:02:03.16" data-timestamp="123.16">Today's program came out of a question that we had here at the radio show. We genuinely did not understand why American car makers waited until they were nearly extinct-- two of them bankrupt, one of them nearly bankrupt. Why didn't they get on the ball and start making reliable cars that could compete with the Japanese decades ago?</p><p begin="00:02:20.27" data-timestamp="140.27">It seemed like, OK, you're running a business. You're losing sales in such a huge way. Why wouldn't you change? It really made no sense.</p><p begin="00:02:28.17" data-timestamp="148.17">And we looked around for an explanation, and we learned about this one car factory in California. Here.</p><p begin="00:02:38.87" data-timestamp="158.87">What happened at this factory not only illustrates some very interesting answers to that question, it captures a lot of what went wrong in the American car business in the last 35 years. This is a plant in Fremont, California, called NUMMI. NUMMI stands for New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated.</p><p begin="00:02:58.99" data-timestamp="178.99">A modern car plant, by the way, sounds a lot like a casino. The automated gear plays these little songs to let you know that it's running. Driverless robotic carts glide up and down the aisles like R2D2 delivering doors and other parts. Their song is supposed to warn you that they're coming.</p><p begin="00:03:16.79" data-timestamp="196.79">The story of this particular factory is actually a famous story among car people. It's taught at business schools. NUMMI was opened in 1984 by GM and Toyota together. The two companies decided that this would be a place that they would build cars with each other.</p><p begin="00:03:32.56" data-timestamp="212.56">And if it seems strange to you that two competitors would do this, it seemed strange at the time, also. A headline in <i>Car</i> <i>and</i> <i>Driver</i> about the partnership read, "Hell Freezes Over." But both companies had their reasons. We'll get to those.</p><p begin="00:03:45.08" data-timestamp="225.08">At NUMMI, Toyota showed GM all of its secrets. Showed it exactly how it made some of the best-built, most reliable cars in the world back then. GM, at the time, hoped to take these lessons from NUMMI and carry them into all their other plants, all over the country and over the world. That was the 1980s.</p><p begin="00:04:03.85" data-timestamp="243.85">And then, well, you know, it didn't go well. GM was one of the car makers who went bankrupt. US taxpayers, you and I, we bailed them out for $50 billion.</p><p begin="00:04:13.56" data-timestamp="253.56">And NUMMI closed. This GM plant that seemed like it might be able to teach American car makers how to catch up to their competitors-- it stopped making cars for GM. The sounds that you're hearing right now-- they were recorded in 2010, in the last months before GM shuttered the place, on April Fools' Day that year.</p><p begin="00:04:30.34" data-timestamp="270.34">Back then, we put together this story that we're about to play for you today. For a few months before NUMMI closed, Frank Langfitt, who at the time was NPR's automotive correspondent, and one of our producers, Brian Reed, travelled around the country talking to GM workers and managers about what had happened at NUMMI. General Motors and the UAW-- they are secretive cultures. But as you're going to hear, people were blunt when they talked to Frank about this. They were blunt in a way that you rarely hear with auto executives and UAW reps when they're being interviewed by the press.</p><p begin="00:04:58.94" data-timestamp="298.94">Act One of our show is going to be about the rise of NUMMI. Act Two is where we get the answer to our question-- what prevented GM from learning from NUMMI for so many years? For WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Our show today produced with our colleagues at NPR News.</p><p begin="00:05:14.69" data-timestamp="314.69">And now it is my pleasure to turn the story over to Frank Langfitt.</p></div> </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:05:18.62" data-timestamp="318.62">When NUMMI was conceived, General Motors was far and away the world's largest car company. Its US market share was seven times that of Toyota. But each company had a problem that the other company could help them solve.</p><p begin="00:05:31.21" data-timestamp="331.21">On GM's side, the problem was small cars. Under government emission guidelines, General Motors had to build them, but they always lost money for GM, and they were lousy quality. So Toyota suggested a joint venture that offered two things. First, Toyota would build a quality small car for GM-- one that would finally turn a profit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:05:51.50" data-timestamp="351.5">And the second thing was, we have this thing called the Toyota production system, and it produces the quality you see. We could teach you the Toyota production system.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:06:00.41" data-timestamp="360.41">Jeffrey Liker is a professor of industrial engineering at the University of Michigan. He's been studying Japanese auto manufacturing, including NUMMI, since the 1980s, and wrote a book about it called <i>The</i> <i>Toyota</i> <i>Way</i>. He says even though Toyota was offering GM something quite remarkable-- to teach a competitor its secrets, to show them exactly how Toyota achieved such phenomenal reliability-- GM wasn't that interested.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:06:25.59" data-timestamp="385.59">Some people in GM, I think, had some foresight to realize this is important. I think for many of the senior leaders, it was more, OK, well, maybe I'll learn something, maybe I won't, but it won't hurt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:06:37.54" data-timestamp="397.54">Why wouldn't they be really interested in the Toyota production system? Because at that point, wasn't Toyota building higher quality cars?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:06:44.36" data-timestamp="404.36">Toyota was building higher quality cars. I'm not sure it was 100% accepted at that time by senior management that Japanese quality was really better.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:06:53.23" data-timestamp="413.23">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:06:53.87" data-timestamp="413.87">I think there was pride and defensiveness. I'm proud because I'm the biggest automaker in the world. I've been the best. I've dominated the market. You can't teach me anything, you little Japanese company.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:07:13.59" data-timestamp="433.59">I'm John Shook. Toyota and Toyota City was completely Japanese when I joined them. I was the first non-Japanese to join them as a regular employee in Toyota City.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:07:23.70" data-timestamp="443.7">John Shook moved to Japan in the early 1980s because of his fascination with Japanese management techniques. He read books about them back home in east Tennessee. And he decided to fly halfway around the globe, learn to speak the language, and hunt for a job with the biggest Japanese company that would have him. Toyota hired him to train American workers in the joint venture.</p><p begin="00:07:43.40" data-timestamp="463.4">Now, here was the problem that pushed Toyota into the deal. They needed to learn how to build cars in America. For years, the Japanese had been winning away customers from Detroit-- so many that now the US Congress was threatening to restrict car imports. Toyota could avoid that by making cars in the US.</p><p begin="00:08:00.37" data-timestamp="480.37">But they wanted a partner. Here's John Shook.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:08:03.41" data-timestamp="483.41">Toyota was looking specifically for things they could learn. How can we work with American workers? How can we make sure that our management system can work in North America? And they'd been pretty happy just producing in Toyota City, doing a very good job. And the idea of actually taking their system and producing outside of Toyota City was scary to them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:08:22.54" data-timestamp="502.54">Toyota was right to be scared. Compared to Japan, where auto workers and management worked together, labor relations in America were more like war. And at the GM plant in Fremont, it felt at times like hand to hand combat.</p><p begin="00:08:36.25" data-timestamp="516.25">A former running back from the University of Arkansas named Bruce Lee ran the western region for the United Auto Workers, and was in charge of the Fremont Union Local 1364.

And it was a reputation that was well-earned. Everything was a fight.</p><p begin="00:09:06.43" data-timestamp="546.43">They spent more time on grievances and on things like that than they did on producing cars. They had strikes all the time. It was just chaos constantly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:09:23.05" data-timestamp="563.05">The Fremont, California plant for General Motors was bad by GM standards.

So they were trapped there.</p><p begin="00:10:15.70" data-timestamp="615.7">And they also felt like we have a job for life, and the union will always protect us. So we're stuck here, and it's long term. And then all these illegal things crop up, so we can entertain ourselves while we're stuck here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:10:28.80" data-timestamp="628.8">A lot of booze on the line.

Under the union contract, it was almost impossible to fire anybody. And if management ticked off the union, workers could just shut the plant down in minutes.</p><p begin="00:11:46.63" data-timestamp="706.63">With that sort of leverage, absenteeism became absurd. On a normal day, one out of five workers just didn't show up. It was even worse on Mondays. Billy Haggerty worked in hood and fender assembly.

Grievance.</p><p begin="00:12:23.61" data-timestamp="743.61">The strategy was simple. Pile up grievances, real or imagined, by the thousands, then use them to squeeze money or concessions out of management. And Fremont workers struck back at their bosses in other ways. They'd intentionally screw up the vehicles, put Coke bottles or loose bolts inside the door panels so they'd rattle and annoy the customer. They'd scratch cars.</p><p begin="00:12:45.32" data-timestamp="765.32">Richard Aguilar inspected vehicles at the plant. He saw one guy do something even worse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Aguilar</h4><p begin="00:12:50.99" data-timestamp="770.99">He left some loose bolts on this front suspension. That was dangerous. I went and told the assistant manager right away. They went out there, and they checked it, and there were like 400 cars he'd done that too. He was mad because they had suspended him for drinking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:13:10.81" data-timestamp="790.81">By 1982, GM had had enough, and put the Fremont factory out of its misery. The company laid off thousands of workers and closed the plant.</p><p begin="00:13:20.98" data-timestamp="800.98">The next year, when GM and Toyota began planning to reopen the plant for the joint venture, there was one thing neither company wanted to do-- hire the same union leaders who'd battled management and overseen GM's worst workforce. Then the UAW's Bruce Lee sat down with Chairman Eiji Toyoda.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:13:37.48" data-timestamp="817.48">And one of the first things I said is, I've got to hire the first 50 people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:13:41.78" data-timestamp="821.78">So who did you hire?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:13:43.63" data-timestamp="823.63">The same leadership that was in the union before.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:13:48.59" data-timestamp="828.59">Why?

Toyota execs believed their system would turn bad workers into good ones. Then Lee had to sell the plan to the rank and file. He held a meeting and told union members that Fremont would now be a Japanese style plant. Old seniority rules wouldn't apply. Life at the plant would be totally different. The workers hated all this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:14:20.74" data-timestamp="860.74">They didn't want anything changed.

But Lee had something very powerful on his side. Most of the workers desperately needed jobs. And Lee had them.</p><p begin="00:14:40.37" data-timestamp="880.37">When NUMMI opened, over 85% of the workforce were old hands from GM Fremont. But to prepare them for that moment, in the spring of 1984, Toyota started flying them to Japan in groups of 30 to begin learning the Toyota system for making cars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:14:55.34" data-timestamp="895.34">Well, when the NUMMI workers first came to Japan, me, as well as certainly my Japanese bosses, had heard all these horrible things about the American worker, about the American union.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:15:03.35" data-timestamp="903.35">As the one American working in Toyota City, John Shook helped design this training.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:15:08.01" data-timestamp="908.01">And we had certainly heard all these stories about the workforce there at the Fremont plant, and it was our job to show them a new and very different way of working. What would they do? How would they respond to this? How would they react?</p><p begin="00:15:19.60" data-timestamp="919.6">And no one knew. I didn't know. So everyone was very, very nervous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Earl Ferguson</h4><p begin="00:15:23.65" data-timestamp="923.65">I was kind of apprehensive about what I was going to see when I arrived in Japan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:15:28.31" data-timestamp="928.31">On one of those planes was Earl Ferguson.

He also notes for his Japanese viewers that the Americans are so much larger than the Japanese, they waste a second or two more each time they get in and out of the vehicles they're building, which makes them 10% to 15% less productive than their Asian counterparts.</p><p begin="00:17:14.77" data-timestamp="1034.77">The key to the Toyota production system was a principle so basic it sounds like an empty management slogan. Teamwork. Back home in Fremont, GM supervisors ordered around large groups of workers. At the Takaoka plant, people were divided into teams of just four or five, switched jobs every few hours to relieve the monotony, and a team leader would step in to help whenever anything went wrong. Again, Professor Jeffrey Liker and Toyota's John Shook.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:17:41.31" data-timestamp="1061.31">And they spent about two weeks, and they worked in a Toyota plant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:17:45.87" data-timestamp="1065.87">Hooked up at the hip with a counterpart in the Corolla plant, someone who did the exact same job you'd be doing back in Fremont.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:17:53.93" data-timestamp="1073.93">And they start to do the job, and they were pretty proud, because they were building cars back in the United States.

And at some point, somebody would come over and say, do you want me to help?</p><p begin="00:18:15.48" data-timestamp="1095.48">And that was a revelation, because nobody in the GM plant would ever ask to help.

I can't remember any time in my working life where anybody asked for my ideas to solve the problem. And they literally want to know.

To spot defects in the cars and the causes of those defects. This is the Japanese concept of kaizen, continuous improvement. When a worker makes a suggestion that saves money, he gets a bonus of a few hundred dollars or so.</p><p begin="00:19:39.94" data-timestamp="1179.94">And if you look around the Toyota plant, you can see the result of all those improvements. Hanging shelves that travel along with the car and the worker, carrying the parts and bolts they need within easy reach. Special cushions they throw into the car frames when they have to kneel inside. Workers' tasks have been streamlined to the fewest possible steps, each step timed down to the second.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:20:01.81" data-timestamp="1201.81">Two seconds to pick up a bolt and put it on.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:13.18" data-timestamp="1933.18">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. If you're just tuning in, we're in the middle of a story about a car plant in Fremont, California called NUMMI. We now turn to the question, why was it so hard for GM to replicate NUMMI elsewhere in the company? Why didn't this idea spread decades ago?</p><p begin="00:32:28.81" data-timestamp="1948.81">In the first half of our story, we heard a lot from workers who were on the factory floor. In this half of the story, the action moves to their bosses-- the supervisors at GM-- who had a chance to turn the company around with what they learned at NUMMI. Again, here's NPR's Frank Langfitt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:32:43.46" data-timestamp="1963.46">GM had gotten the first thing it wanted out of NUMMI-- a high quality small car. Now the question was, how could it spread the lessons of NUMMI throughout the rest of the company? To do that, it set up a special liaison office. Managers were flown in for tours and to work the assembly line for a few days to learn the team concept.</p><p begin="00:33:00.62" data-timestamp="1980.62">And from the beginning, GM executives sent 16 of their rising stars to help start NUMMI, with the idea that later, they'd come home and change the company. Two <i>Wall</i> <i>Street</i> <i>Journal</i> reporters later dubbed them the NUMMI commandos. One of the 16 was Mark Hogan. He says the top brass understood NUMMI's game changing potential, that a Toyota style plant squeezed many more cars out of far fewer workers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:33:23.55" data-timestamp="2003.55">If General Motors was able to take its many manufacturing facilities and implement that production system, it meant billions to General Motors in the bottom line.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Bera</h4><p begin="00:33:34.21" data-timestamp="2014.21">We were ready. We were fired, and we had the mental condition that says, we're going to do this. We're going to change the world.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:33:40.71" data-timestamp="2020.71">That's Steve Bera, another commando. He says once NUMMI was up and running, he and the other 15 waited to be deployed elsewhere for the next phase of their mission. But the company didn't seem to know what to do with them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Bera</h4><p begin="00:33:51.60" data-timestamp="2031.6">Instead of coming back to the 16 of us and saying, there's some secret sauce here. What is it? How can we use this to our advantage? No one ever asked us that question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:34:04.09" data-timestamp="2044.09">Why didn't they do that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steve Bera</h4><p begin="00:34:06.19" data-timestamp="2046.19">It was never part of a master plan. And if there was a master plan, none of us ever saw it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:34:18.28" data-timestamp="2058.28">Frustrated, Bera quit after just two years at NUMMI. With no master plan from Detroit, the first real attempt to do NUMMI again came from a factory manager, 400 miles south of Fremont, at a plant in Van Nuys. The factory was facing a possible shutdown. Its manager, a guy named Ernie Schaefer, had visited NUMMI, and he thought maybe he could save his plant if he adopted the Japanese system.</p><p begin="00:34:41.12" data-timestamp="2081.12">But he didn't have all the advantages Fremont had. This time, Toyota wasn't a partner in the experiment. GM had to transform Van Nuys on its own. Ernie Schaefer knew it was going to be tough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:34:51.37" data-timestamp="2091.37">The thing that I think kept us moving forward is we had no alternative. I mean, it was pretty well known that if we didn't successfully implement this philosophy in Van Nuys, we weren't going to be around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:35:05.70" data-timestamp="2105.7">Van Nuys made Firebirds and Camaros, and its reputation wasn't much better than GM Fremont's had been-- defective cars coming off the line, battles with the union, sabotage. So Ernie Schaefer enlisted the same UAW leader who got the union on board at NUMMI, Bruce Lee, to help him win over the Van Nuys workforce. They shut down the plant for two weeks to train everyone in team concept and quality control.</p><p begin="00:35:28.58" data-timestamp="2128.58">For this workforce, there were no trips to Japan, no tearful sushi parties. And from the start, workers were skeptical.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:35:35.21" data-timestamp="2135.21">The lack of receptiveness to change was so deep.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:35:40.23" data-timestamp="2140.23">Larry Spiegel was another NUMMI commando. He moved down to Van Nuys to help launch the Japanese system there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:35:45.20" data-timestamp="2145.2">There were too many people convinced that they didn't need to have to change.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:35:49.60" data-timestamp="2149.6">Hadn't General Motors threatened to close the plant?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:35:52.27" data-timestamp="2152.27">They didn't believe them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:35:53.58" data-timestamp="2153.58">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:35:57.14" data-timestamp="2157.14">It's not logical. They just didn't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:36:03.19" data-timestamp="2163.19">This was one of the biggest differences between Fremont and Van Nuys. Van Nuys hadn't been shut down. Turns out it's a lot easier to get workers to change if they've lost their jobs, and then you offer them back. Without that, many union members just saw the Toyota system as a threat.</p><p begin="00:36:19.13" data-timestamp="2179.13">And they had a point. Under the Japanese system, Van Nuys stood to lose a fourth of its workforce, because the more efficient a plant becomes, the fewer workers it needs. And just as bad, the team concept hurt their seniority rights. This had been a problem for union members back at NUMMI also.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Aguilar</h4><p begin="00:36:34.45" data-timestamp="2194.45">Your seniority is what you work for. To me, that's what a union's about. Seniority.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:36:38.71" data-timestamp="2198.71">Richard Aguilar worked at NUMMI, and to him, seniority was just another way of saying fairness. He waited 15 years to get enough seniority for the job he'd always wanted in the plant. Under the new system, management could just hire someone off the street for that job. The whole idea of seniority placing you into one great job for years was impossible under the team concept. Workers had to learn every job on their team and take turns doing those jobs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Aguilar</h4><p begin="00:37:03.77" data-timestamp="2223.77">And the team concept, it sounds good. I mean, team player sounds good, but it pit worker against worker. It really does.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:37:16.35" data-timestamp="2236.35">This was the other thing Richard hated about the Japanese system. The whole point of a union, its most basic principle, was to protect you from management. But once people were working in teams, Richard says union members started doing things for management that just seemed wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Aguilar</h4><p begin="00:37:30.87" data-timestamp="2250.87">People now snitched on each other. You know, they'd point fingers. Oh, he's not doing this job right, you know, or she's not doing the job right. And they would even keep track of stuff they'd missed, because that's what the company puts on them-- that the only way you can protect your job, you have to keep the team strong. So there's a weak link, you've got to get rid of that weak link.</p><p begin="00:37:53.94" data-timestamp="2273.94">And I would go tell them, you can't do that. You can't build a case for management against a union member. It made me angry and disappointed that the union had gotten so backwards that they'd forgotten what a union meant-- taking care of each other.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:38:10.28" data-timestamp="2290.28">At Van Nuys, it wasn't just union members who resisted the Japanese system. Managers were against it too. Like the union members, they didn't want change. There were things they liked about the old system. It gave them privileges and perks they'd now be losing.</p><p begin="00:38:24.97" data-timestamp="2304.97">For instance, some managers opposed the idea of stopping the assembly line, because their bonuses depended on the number of cars that rolled off the line. Never mind how many defects they had. And now that workers and managers were supposed to be a team, executives and workers would share the same cafeteria and same parking lot, as equals. Managers at NUMMI didn't have a problem with that, but the managers at Van Nuys?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:38:49.49" data-timestamp="2329.49">They rioted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:38:50.94" data-timestamp="2330.94">The UAW's Bruce Lee remembers getting a phone call from plant supervisor Ernie Schaefer about his managers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:38:56.63" data-timestamp="2336.63">They basically told Ernie, you do that and we're out of here. We're going to quit en masse. Because Ernie called me, and he said, Bruce, I can't do it. I can't do those things.</p><p begin="00:39:10.14" data-timestamp="2350.14">I said, just think about it. That's a nothing. So they have to walk 20 yards more. I said, isn't that foolish that some grown man would come up and tell you, I'm going to quit if I can't have this parking place right here?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:39:28.19" data-timestamp="2368.19">So people fought the new system from both sides. Managers gave Ernie grief, and a dissident faction sprang up in the local union, which elected a staunch opponent of the Japanese system as their chairman. And as if that all wasn't enough, Ernie Schaefer ran into another obstacle. Workers could only build cars as good as the parts they were given. At NUMMI, many of the parts came from Japan and were really good. At Van Nuys, it was totally different.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:39:54.15" data-timestamp="2394.15">That was perhaps one of our biggest failures in that an isolated plant can't do this by itself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:40:01.50" data-timestamp="2401.5">The team concept stressed continuous improvement. If a team got a shipment of parts that didn't fit, they'd alert their bosses, who'd then go to the suppliers to fix the problem. Sometimes they'd realize the problem was in the part's design, and Toyota engineers would go back to the drawing board and remake the part to address the problem workers were having on the assembly line. All the departments in the company worked together.</p><p begin="00:40:24.72" data-timestamp="2424.72">But Ernie's suppliers had never operated in a system like that. If he asked for fixes, they blew him off. And if he called Detroit and asked them to redesign a part that wasn't working, they'd ask him, why was he so special? They didn't have to change it for any other plant. Why should they change it for him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:40:42.11" data-timestamp="2442.11">You had asked the question earlier, what's different when you walk into the NUMMI plant? Well, you can see a lot of things different. But the one thing you don't see is the system that supports the NUMMI plant. I don't think at that time, anybody understood the large nature of this system.</p><p begin="00:41:00.97" data-timestamp="2460.97">General Motors was a kind of throw it over the wall organization. You know, each department-- we were very compartmentalized, and you'd design that vehicle, and you'd throw it over the wall to the manufacturing guys.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:41:14.02" data-timestamp="2474.02">And if something didn't work, or was impossible to assemble, that was their problem.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:41:18.24" data-timestamp="2478.24">And they had to deal with it. And, I mean, you're in there. You've kind of put your heart and soul into making this whole team concept work. And now you're the messenger that has to go out and say, look, guys, even though this is the way the system's supposed to work, and these are my issues, I'm not going to be able to solve them, and you're going to have to deal with it.</p><p begin="00:41:41.23" data-timestamp="2501.23">And it was destructive. It was detrimental. I mean, no question about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:41:53.84" data-timestamp="2513.84">Schaefer says when he realized how much of the Japanese system happened off the factory floor, it answered something that had never quite made sense to him. Why had Toyota been so open with GM in showing its operations?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernie Schaefer</h4><p begin="00:42:05.31" data-timestamp="2525.31">You know, they never prohibited us from walking through the plant, understanding, even asking questions of some of their key people. You know, I've often puzzled over that-- why they did that. And I think they recognized we were asking all the wrong questions.</p><p begin="00:42:22.66" data-timestamp="2542.66">We didn't understand this bigger picture thing. All of our questions were focused on the floor, you know? The assembly plant. What's happening on the line. That's not the real issue. The issue is, how do you support that system with all the other functions that have to take place in the organization?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:42:45.91" data-timestamp="2565.91">Quality at Van Nuys didn't improve, and in 1992, GM shut the plant down for good, leaving 2,600 people without jobs. This is what the NUMMI commandos were up against. Entrenched, defensive bureaucracies and workers many of the places they turned. They were not only trying to change the biggest corporation in the world. They were trying to change a corporation that had been essentially a collection of individual car companies-- Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick-- each with its own design team, own leadership, and its own way of doing things.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dick Fuller</h4><p begin="00:43:21.62" data-timestamp="2601.62">It's a whole new process, a whole different process, than the one they had grown up with. And it was a huge threat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:43:28.05" data-timestamp="2608.05">Dick Fuller was another commando. He ran the information technology division at NUMMI, which used some of the same streamlining concepts employed on the factory floor. He says when GM managers visited NUMMI, instead of trying to figure out how they could benefit from the system, some of them attacked it. Fuller remembers one IT manager who visited from a plant on the East Coast.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dick Fuller</h4><p begin="00:43:48.22" data-timestamp="2628.22">And when he came back, he wrote a report, which, if I put a title on it, would say, won't work here. And I think part of that was a threat to him. It was a threat to him to see that it was working so well.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:44:05.02" data-timestamp="2645.02">Do you think this guy looked at this and said, well, if this works here, and they try to spread it, I'll lose my job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dick Fuller</h4><p begin="00:44:11.16" data-timestamp="2651.16">Well, I don't think he was going to lose his job, but he'd probably have to give up half his staff, you know? So that's power. It's people that's power in General Motors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:44:23.32" data-timestamp="2663.32">Getting all these mini empires to embrace the kinds of radical changes that happened at NUMMI would have taken an almost Stalinesque leadership from above-- a combination of charisma and fury in the corner office. And NUMMI commando Mark Hogan says no one at GM fit that bill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:39.21" data-timestamp="2679.21">I was very convinced that we had to change, and we had to change rapidly. And I think all of us that were NUMMI alums, so to speak, were frustrated at the lack of urgency.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:44:50.85" data-timestamp="2690.85">Did you have those kinds of conversations with people in the '80s back in Detroit?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:54.51" data-timestamp="2694.51">I did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:44:55.15" data-timestamp="2695.15">What would people say to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:57.22" data-timestamp="2697.22">Yeah. I think there still wasn't a recognition that the formidability of the competition, particularly from Toyota-- I think a lot of people were in denial, or just not willing to recognize it. And even though GM had gone from 50% market share in the early '70s to mid-30s, it was gradual over time, and there wasn't the sense of reaction or urgency that other companies that lost that much market share might have felt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:45:29.44" data-timestamp="2729.44">Those exact numbers? GM went from 47% of the US market in the mid-1970s to 35% a decade later. One reason car execs were in denial was Detroit's insular culture. Yes, unions and management were always at each other's throats, and yes, GM and its suppliers had a destructive relationship that seemed to almost discourage quality. But everyone had settled into comfortable roles in this dysfunctional system and learned to live with it. And in the late 1980s, with their market share in freefall, Jeffrey Liker says they were more apt to blame others than themselves.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:46:02.89" data-timestamp="2762.89">I worked with all the big three, at the time, automakers, and it was common in all three automakers. They all believed that if the consumers think we have quality problems, it's because <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> is misleading them, and they're biased toward Toyota. They all believed that <i>Consumer</i> <i>Reports</i> was against them-- that there was somewhat of a myth of Japanese quality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:46:28.37" data-timestamp="2788.37">If all of that wasn't enough to stymie attempts to learn from NUMMI, GM was distracted by other projects-- massive projects. It bought Ross Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems. It bought Hughes Aircraft for $5 billion. It decided the future was robotics. It decided the future was a massive, costly reorganization. It started Saturn, which produced cars that were better marketed than they were built.</p><p begin="00:46:51.92" data-timestamp="2811.92">Then came the 1991 recession. Car sales slumped. Again, Mark Hogan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:46:56.99" data-timestamp="2816.99">It was really its first significant wake up call. GM, unfortunately, had a massive loss in 1992. General Motors lost more than $20 billion. So I think at that point in time, there was a complete rethinking of the way we ran the company-- that things had to change, and they had to change fast.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:47:18.04" data-timestamp="2838.04">It was the largest loss in American corporate history to that time-- $23.5 billion. GM's board of directors responded with what the press called a boardroom bloodbath, purging a long list of managers. Jack Smith took over as CEO. He was the executive who led the negotiations with Toyota to create NUMMI.</p><p begin="00:47:36.62" data-timestamp="2856.62">He saw NUMMI as a way forward for GM. Mark Hogan and some of the other commandos felt they finally had a champion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:47:43.28" data-timestamp="2863.28">Jack Smith was installed, and started to rapidly implement the Toyota production system into General Motors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:47:50.67" data-timestamp="2870.67">Rapidly by GM standards, which wasn't nearly rapidly enough. Jack Smith declined to talk to me for this story, but he told a reporter a few years ago, "I just wish it had happened a lot faster than it did." Pick your nautical cliche. Reforming General Motors was like turning around a battleship, one manager said. Another compared it to steering the Titanic with a canoe paddle. Jeffrey Liker says the cultural gap between NUMMI and the rest of GM was so vast that even with clear marching orders to change, some of the people running the company didn't know where to begin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:48:23.48" data-timestamp="2903.48">There was no vocabulary, even, to explain it. I remember one of the GM managers was ordered from a very senior level-- it came from a vice president-- to make a GM plant look like NUMMI. And he said, I want you to go there with cameras and take a picture of every square inch. And whatever you take a picture of, I want it to look like that in our plant. There should be no excuse for why we're different than NUMMI, why our quality is lower, why our productivity isn't as high, because you're going to copy everything you see.</p><p begin="00:48:58.59" data-timestamp="2938.59">Immediately, this guy knew that was crazy. We can't copy employee motivation. We can't copy good relationships between the union and management. That's not something you can copy, and you can't even take a photograph of it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:49:15.64" data-timestamp="2955.64">The first round of changes put andon cords and Japanese-style inventory control into the GM plants, but there was no change in the culture. Workers and managers continued their old antagonistic ways. In some of the factories where they installed the andon cord, workers got yelled at when they pulled it. A few plants even cut the cords down.</p><p begin="00:49:34.52" data-timestamp="2974.52">So the second round of changes included some team concepts. They put together a book explaining how each plant should run and the reasoning behind it. Jeff Weller was one of the people dispatched in the 1990s to convert the company plant by plant. Weller says some factory managers were receptive, but in the sprawling, decentralized system, the plant manager was still king, and ran the factory the way he wanted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Weller</h4><p begin="00:49:56.92" data-timestamp="2996.92">We had some tough goes in some of our facilities, where we spent more time trying to convince the plant leadership versus actually going on and doing the implementation. I would say, I was asked in one plant to leave, because they were not interested in what I had to sell.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:50:20.80" data-timestamp="3020.8">How did he actually ask you to leave? What did he say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Weller</h4><p begin="00:50:24.03" data-timestamp="3024.03">We're finished, and you can leave.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:50:26.71" data-timestamp="3026.71">And what did you do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Weller</h4><p begin="00:50:27.82" data-timestamp="3027.82">I left, because, you know, I was in his home, so to speak. His territory. His plant.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:50:35.70" data-timestamp="3035.7">Now, whatever happened to that plant manager who asked you to leave?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Weller</h4><p begin="00:50:39.74" data-timestamp="3039.74">That plant manager eventually retired.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:50:43.39" data-timestamp="3043.39">This may sound like a naive question, but why didn't the CEO pick up the phone and say, you're fired?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Weller</h4><p begin="00:50:49.70" data-timestamp="3049.7">Well, it's a big company, and I'm not sure that, you know-- it doesn't work that way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:51:01.64" data-timestamp="3061.64">Lots of people in GM still didn't see the need to change. By the late 1990s, the company was posting huge profits selling trucks and SUVs, which made the loss in market share seem less urgent. To make real progress, managers had to leave the United States. One overhauled GM Germany.</p><p begin="00:51:18.44" data-timestamp="3078.44">Mark Hogan took over GM Brazil in 1994 to enact NUMMI principles there. In Brazil, he had a big, unionized workforce, but he could avoid GM's bureaucracy, its supplier network, and the United Auto Workers.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:51:31.26" data-timestamp="3091.26">How long did it take you to implement the lessons of NUMMI in Brazil?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:51:35.99" data-timestamp="3095.99">It took us about 18 to 24 months, which at the time, I was quite impatient about. I mean, I wanted it faster.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:51:43.51" data-timestamp="3103.51">And what did that mean for the bottom line for GM?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:51:46.33" data-timestamp="3106.33">Well, in that time frame, particularly '94 through '97, GM Brazil was one of the most profitable entities within GM.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:51:55.34" data-timestamp="3115.34">But in America, everyone I talked to said it took about a decade and a half after NUMMI for change to even begin to take hold at GM. By the year 2000, GM finally started to see a generational transformation. Jeffrey Liker says so many managers had come through NUMMI for training for a day or a week or a year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:52:14.77" data-timestamp="3134.77">Over time, you start to get 10 people, 20 people, 100 people, 300 people. And you now have a critical mass of people in GM who've all been in NUMMI. They've lived it. Now they're managing people and teaching them what they learned. And it snowballs, and suddenly, the world is different at GM, and nobody can even tell you exactly why.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:52:33.68" data-timestamp="3153.68">By the early 2000s, GM had developed a production model with the UAW based on Japanese principles that would go into all of its plants. It was called the Global Manufacturing System. And although GM quality still lags behind the imports, it's improved a lot. Again, Jeffrey Liker.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:52:49.68" data-timestamp="3169.68">If you look carefully at the quality of a GM product, and you look with a fine tooth comb, with a magnifying glass, you're going to see a level of quality that you didn't see 15 years ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:53:02.25" data-timestamp="3182.25">You want to show me for a sec? Do you mind? There's one right here.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:53:06.14" data-timestamp="3186.14">I did my interview with Jeffrey Liker at the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, and we walked over to the GM exhibit, to the Cadillac SRX, which is a small SUV. Jeffrey pointed to the gap between the doors and the car frame, which is supposed to be uniform.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:53:20.45" data-timestamp="3200.45">And if we look down here, it looks really good, right? The gap is about the same between the front and the back door. The surface is very smooth and very uniform.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:53:32.37" data-timestamp="3212.37">And 15 years ago, what would that have looked like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeffrey Liker</h4><p begin="00:53:33.92" data-timestamp="3213.92">You would see maybe at the top, it would be more narrow than at the bottom. If you look inside the car, and you open the glove box, it falls very gradually down the way it's supposed to. You close it-- I barely have to touch it, and it closes tightly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:53:55.39" data-timestamp="3235.39">Precision in all these details makes for a better-looking, more reliable car, where things work like they're supposed to. But this improvement didn't come soon enough. Some cars and some plants improved less quickly than others. And while GM was getting better, so were its competitors, leaving it still near the back of the pack.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Womack</h4><p begin="00:54:11.51" data-timestamp="3251.51">Well, one of the ironies of GM was that in the moment it went bankrupt, it was probably a better company than it had ever been.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:54:17.33" data-timestamp="3257.33">That's James Womack, co-author of a seminal book comparing the Toyota and GM production systems, <i>The</i> <i>Machine</i> <i>That</i> <i>Changed</i> <i>the</i> <i>World.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Womack</h4><p begin="00:54:24.67" data-timestamp="3264.67">In the factories, they had really dramatically closed the productivity gap that they had had for many, many years. And on the new products, they have much better quality. So the company that failed was actually doing better than it had ever done. But it was too late, and that's really sort of hard to forgive-- that if you take 30 years to figure it out, chances are you're going to get run over. And they got run over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:54:55.32" data-timestamp="3295.32">In the end, what did them in was the 2008 recession. It destroyed the car market. The next year, General Motors became the largest industrial bankruptcy in US history. Its bailout cost taxpayers more than $50 billion. I asked Mark Hogan, the NUMMI commando who went on to run GM's small car division in North America, if GM had adopted NUMMI earlier, could it have really changed all that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:55:19.14" data-timestamp="3319.14">Definitely. I think if General Motors had moved in the late '80s to implement the system across the board, it may very well have saved GM from going into bankruptcy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:55:30.66" data-timestamp="3330.66">Explain that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Hogan</h4><p begin="00:55:31.86" data-timestamp="3331.86">Well, I just think the productivity and the quality changes that come with that would have been so profound that this ever increasing loss of market share would have been stopped.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:55:44.05" data-timestamp="3344.05">Well, I think they'd have been building a higher quality product.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:55:47.33" data-timestamp="3347.33">Again, the UAW's Bruce Lee.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bruce Lee</h4><p begin="00:55:49.36" data-timestamp="3349.36">You know, they sold junk for a while. Just any kind of piece of crap they could roll out there, they did. And they paid a tremendous price for it. And even when they turned the corner in quality, people didn't trust them.</p><p begin="00:56:04.86" data-timestamp="3364.86">They'd say, well, gee, they're building a good car now. Why aren't they buying them? Because they don't trust them. But had they adopted and embraced the team concept in an honest way, they were going to do this, I think it might have dramatically changed what happened in the American auto industry. There's no question in my mind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:56:28.04" data-timestamp="3388.04">Of course, quality and reliability weren't the only problems that brought GM down. Executives made other big mistakes. Over the years, General Motors negotiated contracts with the UAW with such generous health care coverage that by 2007, it amounted to more than $1,600 for each vehicle GM produced in North America. And initially, some GM executives dismissed hybrid cars like the Prius as a publicity stunt. Instead, they bet the company on SUVs and trucks, only to see sales crash when gas hit $4.00 a gallon.</p><p begin="00:57:07.01" data-timestamp="3427.01">Over the last decade, as GM became more like Toyota, Toyota became a little bit like GM. In 2008, it took over the title from GM of the world's largest automaker. But Toyota executives now say the company did this by making one of GM's old mistakes-- stressing quantity over quality.</p><p begin="00:57:26.17" data-timestamp="3446.17">Akio Toyoda is the company CEO. He's the grandson of the founder, and cut his teeth at NUMMI. At a congressional hearing in 2010 about Toyota's sudden acceleration problems, he said the company's fatal mistake was growing too fast.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Akio Toyoda</h4><p begin="00:57:40.06" data-timestamp="3460.06">We pursued growth over the speed at which we are able to develop our people and our organization, and I am deeply sorry for any accident that Toyota drivers have experienced.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:58:07.44" data-timestamp="3487.44">It was 15 years before GM took the lessons of NUMMI seriously, and it spent the next 10 years slowly implementing what it learned. And all the time, the NUMMI plant kept pumping out vehicles-- 6,000 a week on average, two shifts a day. Toyota got what it wanted out of the deal. A year after starting NUMMI, it began opening other factories around the US, using what it had learned in Fremont.</p><p begin="00:58:31.27" data-timestamp="3511.27">GM and Toyota continued to run NUMMI together until 2009, when GM went bankrupt and pulled out, leaving Toyota to run the plant alone. Toyota decided to shut the factory down. It was their only unionized plant in the United States.</p><p begin="00:58:45.70" data-timestamp="3525.7">In April 2010, NUMMI produced its very last car-- a Corolla. 4,500 people lost their jobs. This is the first factory Toyota has shut down since it was founded 73 years ago.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:58:59.63" data-timestamp="3539.63">Toyota's not perfect. GM is not perfect. But I think anyone who touched NUMMI will never forget it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:59:06.39" data-timestamp="3546.39">One last time, that's John Shook, the first American Toyota hired for NUMMI.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Shook</h4><p begin="00:59:11.12" data-timestamp="3551.12">It does represent something that was special at a point in time. It was a laboratory. My learning curve-- it wasn't just a curve. It was a 90 degree right angle. I loved every minute of it. And almost everyone I think you'll talk to who worked on NUMMI will say the same thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:59:32.75" data-timestamp="3572.75">I'm so fortunate that I ended my career in the auto industry at NUMMI.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="00:59:37.88" data-timestamp="3577.88">Rick Madrid retired from the assembly line in 1992.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rick Madrid</h4><p begin="00:59:41.40" data-timestamp="3581.4">I just hate to see the plant close. Oh, that just hurts me. End of an era. It changed my life from being depressed, bored, and like my son said, changed my attitude. It changed me all for the better. I really hate to see it go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="00:59:59.73" data-timestamp="3599.73">I look at cars, and I see a lot of the cars that we built.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="01:00:03.93" data-timestamp="3603.93">That's Billy Haggerty, who ended up putting in 18 years at NUMMI without a vacation day. He says just the other day he saw one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy Haggerty</h4><p begin="01:00:11.34" data-timestamp="3611.34">But I just seen-- what was it? An '86, '87 Corolla pull in right around the corner here. I was heading for the bank. And I just looked at it and said, boy, that one's old. And I looked down, and it was a Corolla.</p><p begin="01:00:27.48" data-timestamp="3627.48">I know we built it right there. So it's still running. It's still kicking. It feels good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Frank Langfitt</h4><p begin="01:00:37.50" data-timestamp="3637.5">This is also NUMMI's legacy. In the end, it's not just a symbol for so many things that went wrong with GM. It's also a really good car plant. One that turned out nearly 8 million high-quality cars and trucks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:00:57.36" data-timestamp="3657.36">Frank Langfitt.
