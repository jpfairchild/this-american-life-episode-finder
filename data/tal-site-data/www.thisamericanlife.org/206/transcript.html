<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.25" data-timestamp="0.25">Today's radio show was first recorded back in January 2002. It was still very early after September 11, and US forces at the time were fighting in Afghanistan. Today, of course, there are many more Americans fighting in the region than there were back then, and so the show about what daily life is like for some men and women in the war on terror still seems relevant.</p><p begin="00:00:24.41" data-timestamp="24.41">Our enemies are in hiding. Some live in caves. Some cross borders in disguise. Some slip from one safe house to the next. Sometimes they must go hungry. They pray. Meanwhile, on the largest warship ever built, stocked with the most advanced weapons in the world and a crew of over 5,000, an American sailor was doing her job in the war against terror.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:00:45.58" data-timestamp="45.58"> My name is Crevon Scott. I'm just filling up the vending machines.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:00:51.28" data-timestamp="51.28">Is that your full-time job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:00:53.24" data-timestamp="53.24"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:00:54.00" data-timestamp="54">It's your full-time job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:00:55.54" data-timestamp="55.54"> Yeah, filling up vending machines all day for 12 hours.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.49" data-timestamp="66.49">A few weeks ago, <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> producers Alex Blumberg, Wendy Dorr, and I flew halfway around the world to spend some time on the <i>USS</i> <i>John</i> <i>C.</i> <i>Stennis.</i> The <i>Stennis</i> is one of two aircraft carriers that are launching jet fighters to support the ground troops in Afghanistan. Alex is the one who talked to Crevon Scott.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:01:22.54" data-timestamp="82.54">What are the big sellers?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:01:24.92" data-timestamp="84.92"> Right now, it's Snickers and Starburst. Snickers goes real fast.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:01:29.71" data-timestamp="89.71">What's the least favorite candy on board?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:01:31.82" data-timestamp="91.82">Bonkers, the fruit chews. We got boxes of those, and still have them. Sometimes if we don't have anything else, we'll just put all rows of Bonkers, and they'll still stay in here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:01:43.76" data-timestamp="103.76">So people hate Bonkers?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:01:45.19" data-timestamp="105.19">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:01:45.30" data-timestamp="105.3">Nobody likes them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:01:46.19" data-timestamp="106.19">We've still got them. But we've been ordering a whole lot of new stuff, so I've been trying to keep a whole variety of things in here, like Crunch 'n Munch. We just got the Crunch 'n Munch, and the Cheez-Its we normally didn't have in here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:01:56.67" data-timestamp="116.67"> Cheez-Its?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:01:57.12" data-timestamp="117.12">Yeah, the Cheeze-Its. The different kind of Cheez-Its.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:07.36" data-timestamp="127.36">Our enemies, needless to say, are not supplied with Crunch 'n Munch. Yes, we're at war, and yes, that means thousands of Americans are in Kandahar and Kabul and other very dangerous places, doing very dangerous things. But for every person on the front lines, there are dozens backing them up with equipment, logistical support, and Cheez-Its. This aircraft carrier has only 50 or 60 pilots on board who actually drop bombs, who actually take part in combat. Everyone else is here, over 5,000 people, to get them in the air.</p><p begin="00:02:36.52" data-timestamp="156.52">Back home, over the last few months, we've heard about the pilots. We've heard about the people doing more heroic work. But everybody else on this ship is also at war, is also far from home, is also sacrificing something to be here, and we wanted to hear their stories too. It's one thing to turn your life upside down to go shoot bullets at bad guys. It's another to give up everything to go fill candy machines 12 hours a day.</p><p begin="00:02:58.07" data-timestamp="178.07">In the months since the <i>USS</i> <i>Stennis</i> embarked for the Arabian Sea, Crevon has only gone outside twice. If you picture for a moment what an aircraft carrier looks like, the deck of the ship, that big, flat deck, is where jets take off and land, so you can't just walk around up there. She sees daylight maybe once a day. She's 20 years old. It's her first time away from home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crevon Scott</h4><p begin="00:03:18.68" data-timestamp="198.68">You know, the hardest part is just missing home, the home thing. If I can get over that, then I'll be all right. When I first got here, I was really bad. I cried every day, and stuff like that. My parents are really helpful. They email me every day and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:41.28" data-timestamp="221.28">Today on our program, everyday life aboard a ship at war, what it's really like. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Alex and Wendy and I went to the <i>Stennis</i> together, and throughout this hour you'll hear from all three of us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:03:58.96" data-timestamp="238.96">We got to the <i>Stennis</i> about six weeks after the ship arrived in the North Arabian Sea.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:03.69" data-timestamp="243.69">The other aircraft carrier on duty there, the <i>Theodore</i> <i>Roosevelt,</i> sends planes during the day, and the <i>Stennis</i> sends them at night. This means that reveille is called over the ship's PA system to wake everybody up for work at 7:00 PM. We expected a bugle, or at least a recording of a bugle, but it turns out to be sort of no frills.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pa System</h4><p begin="00:04:20.22" data-timestamp="260.22">Reveille, reveille, all hands heave out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:23.42" data-timestamp="263.42">From the time we get up, we're led everywhere by a group of public affairs officers, who are, contrary to what you think they might be-- well, contrary to what we suspected they'd be anyway-- good-humored and quite helpful. Our first day they lead us down a long passageway. Every 15 feet or so there's a junction, and other hallways go off to the left or right, and ladders go up and down. It's like walking through a big Habitrail.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer 1</h4><p begin="00:04:42.77" data-timestamp="282.77">Make a left there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer 2</h4><p begin="00:04:43.44" data-timestamp="283.44">Keep going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.89" data-timestamp="284.89">Remember, the boat is huge. It's four and 1/2 acres. But most of the life of the ship takes place here, in the eight stories of rooms and passageways below the flight deck. There are no windows on these decks, and the boat is so big that in good weather, it doesn't really even sway. And so most of the time, the sensation is less being at sea than being underground in some sort of huge subterranean warren.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer 2</h4><p begin="00:05:05.03" data-timestamp="305.03">Can I cut through?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:06.61" data-timestamp="306.61">You're constantly squeezing by people coming from the other direction.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer 2</h4><p begin="00:05:09.03" data-timestamp="309.03">Hey you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sailor 1</h4><p begin="00:05:09.53" data-timestamp="309.53">Are you still awake?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer 2</h4><p begin="00:05:10.36" data-timestamp="310.36">I'm still awake.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:11.79" data-timestamp="311.79">After five minutes of winding our way through these narrow corridors, we come to a big, rounded steel door. It's maybe five feet tall, airtight. It's got a big lever in the middle. Someone turns it, and we climb through into one of the largest rooms we've ever seen.</p><p begin="00:05:31.51" data-timestamp="331.51">This is the hangar deck. It's two football fields long, three stories tall. Entering it is like walking through a closet door and finding yourself at the pitcher's mound in the Astrodome. We walk past parked fighter planes and hundreds of people, all scurrying around, pushing hand trucks, talking into walkie-talkies. And then we arrive at the hangar bay door, which is basically a three-story hole in the side of the ship.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:05:57.54" data-timestamp="357.54">It's nighttime. Peering out, we can make out the shadowy outline and red running lights of another huge boat traveling at the same speed we are, maybe 100 yards away. A half dozen steel cables stretch between the two ships. Helicopters dip and swerve back and forth. And then, out of the darkness, two pallets with hundreds of pounds of food come swinging in on a cable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark</h4><p begin="00:06:22.56" data-timestamp="382.56"> We just took on two pallets.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:24.39" data-timestamp="384.39">Lieutenant Commander Mark [? Semmler ?] explains that they're bringing on enough food for 5,000 people for 30 days, plus machine parts, bundles of food. People pass boxes of fresh pears and strawberries and avocados fired brigade-style. The entire operation takes over 250 people. I know everyone knows they're at war.

We've got 70-plus aircraft looking for the enemy. When I'm not on a ship, I feel like it could happen anywhere. Any time you drive over a bridge, or go to a public place, it could happen. And I definitely feel safer out here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:07:55.07" data-timestamp="475.07">The average age on board the ship is 21 years old, and when you ask people how they ended up here, the most common answer is, I don't know. They just shrug, and say they were failing out of school, or they wanted to see the world, or they wanted money for college. Almost all the enlistment stories can be summarized as either, I joined the Navy to straighten out my life, or, I joined the Navy because I wanted something more.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jessica Phillips</h4><p begin="00:08:16.68" data-timestamp="496.68">I'm Jessica Phillips.

Thursday?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:08:28.86" data-timestamp="508.86">When I asked Jessica Phillips my question about how she ended up on this ship, she looked up at me and said, do you really want to hear this story? It all began, she said, two and half years ago, working at the mall in a Barnes &amp; Noble, and living in the same small town where she'd grown up in Ocala, Florida.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jessica Phillips</h4><p begin="00:08:44.13" data-timestamp="524.13">Before I'd never even pay attention to military people. It was so what, you're in the Navy. You're a drunken sailor or marine. People call you bullet sponge. Why would you do that? I didn't understand why people-- personally for me, I never thought I'd be in the military. It was a split-second decision.</p><p begin="00:09:01.82" data-timestamp="541.82">The place where I live is considered the black hole. Nobody gets out of there. Most people live and die there, and that's just the way it goes. You grow up with the same people. Everything stays the same. I couldn't take it anymore. So I told my-- I had two girl roommates at the time. And I looked at them. I said, you can have all my stuff. I packed up a suitcase, and I was like, I'm leaving, and I left that night. And I left them money for that month's rent and everything. Look, you need to find a new roommate. I get in my car, which was an '89 Mustang, and just putter away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:09:32.39" data-timestamp="572.39">Jessica had no idea where she was headed. There were vague thoughts of finding someplace cool and applying to college. She made her way up the coast to Raleigh, North Carolina. Jessica ended up stopping in Raleigh, moving in with friends. But without a job, she had to find other ways to make ends meet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jessica Phillips</h4><p begin="00:09:47.18" data-timestamp="587.18">I used to go gas station to gas station, and ask people for money pretty much.

But you can only do that for so long.</p><p begin="00:10:00.68" data-timestamp="600.68">So I was just sitting there, and I was trying to figure out what I did this for, first of all. I gave up all my stuff. I'm almost broke. I was just like, I need to figure out what I need to do. I need to do something with myself.</p><p begin="00:10:23.02" data-timestamp="623.02">We were having a party, and everybody was partying, and I'm sitting outside. And some guy comes up to talk to me, and he said something about what are you doing tomorrow? And I said, I'm going to go home and join the Navy. And he was like, what? He was just like, what are you talking about? I was like, I think I'm going to pack up, and go home and join the Navy. I was like, this is what I need to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:10:43.68" data-timestamp="643.68">Why did the Navy pop into your head?

She was a yeoman, but that was like 20 years ago. And that kind of like came back to me. And I think-- this sounds so cheesy though, but it was like a Navy commercial came on in between television or something. It's the one where they say that the sea is our classroom. They use the intro to some hard core rock song. I think it's a Limp Bizkit song. Maybe not. Maybe it's a Godsmack.</p><p begin="00:11:17.17" data-timestamp="677.17">I don't know, but there's the carrier, and it's racing across, and they've got the jets flying over, and they got the people all smiling in their nice uniforms, and sitting in class doing their schoolwork, and the people who are sitting in front of the radar and looking at the picture. And then they're like, most people go to school, but this is our classroom. And then it says gonavy.com. So then I was like, hey, maybe I will.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:11:48.10" data-timestamp="708.1">From the time you told that guy at the party you were going to join the Navy to the time you were in the Navy, how many days passed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jessica Phillips</h4><p begin="00:11:53.67" data-timestamp="713.67">Six.

When you first get on the bus, it's a whole nice trip. Everybody's polite to you, everything else. Then you get on the bus, and you're sitting there. Some guy gets on the bus, and tells you you're not home anymore and starts yelling. It's the basic boot camp thing. I'm not your mama or your papa. Stop talking. I don't want to hear it. So I was just like, OK, they're just trying to scare me. Whatever. I'm sitting there laughing. I'm like, God, this is such a movie. I was like, how stereotypical is this?</p><p begin="00:12:56.14" data-timestamp="776.14">So they bus us to the Navy boot camp in Great Lakes. And we get off the bus, and it's the middle of the night. It's cold, and they're yelling at you to stand against the wall, and why can't you stand still, and everything else. And when I call your name, yell out your social. And they yell out my name, and I'm standing there yelling my social security number. They're telling me I'm not doing it loud enough. And I'm thinking, what did I do? What am I doing here?</p><p begin="00:13:25.38" data-timestamp="805.38">It's 5:00. Gosh, this day is so clear. It's 5:00 in the morning. And you're looking at a stranger, and you understand everything they're feeling. That was one of the few moments where you look at somebody, and you're like, I know exactly what you're thinking. And I know what you're feeling, because I do too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:13:46.58" data-timestamp="826.58">It got better, of course, and Jessica was satisfied with the Navy. At 22, she says, she's been to countries and seen things she never would have otherwise. But her feelings about the Navy became even stronger after September 11.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jessica Phillips</h4><p begin="00:13:58.75" data-timestamp="838.75">As far as September 11, a personal reflection of what it does: you become a little bit more patriotic. Before it was kind of like, maybe, ah, I'm in it. It's a job. I do my eight hours a day, and then I'm done. I'll be able to get my college money. If you had asked me before as a civilian, I'd have been like, oh, war. Make love, not war. Let's go for the hippie side of it.</p><p begin="00:14:20.26" data-timestamp="860.26">But now it's just kind of like, I want to cry. I'm tired, so I'm going to start crying. But I look at my family, and it's just like, I'm willing to die for these people on the street, the people you're walking by. I'm willing to give, sacrifice myself for what has happened. I don't even know how to correctly say it, but when you realize that you're really fighting for something and for somebody, it kind of gets more personal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:14:47.54" data-timestamp="887.54">Almost everyone we talked to said some version of this, even people who happened to be doing jobs they hated. They all felt proud to be out there defending their country. And sometimes while they would talk about it, an almost startled tone would creep into their voices, as if they were as surprised as anyone that this crappy job felt so different than all the other ones they'd ever done. They felt they were doing something that mattered.</p><p begin="00:15:14.03" data-timestamp="914.03">To give you a sense of the variety of things going on at any given moment on board the <i>Stennis,</i> here's what we passed walking down just one hallway. On O3 deck was Senior Chief Barbara Mendoza, an electronics repair shop, a room in charge of anti-submarine warfare, an air traffic control center, a conference room that they actually call the war room, the office of the admiral who's in charge of this ship and the six other ships and two nuclear-powered subs which travel with it at all times, protecting it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barbara Mendoza</h4><p begin="00:15:40.43" data-timestamp="940.43">This is CVIC.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:41.47" data-timestamp="941.47">CVIC means?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barbara Mendoza</h4><p begin="00:15:42.52" data-timestamp="942.52">Intelligence.

They scheduled a day off from flying, but the quality of the ship's satellite TV reception depends on which direction they're heading, so the plan was this: at the start of the game they would set course in the most TV-friendly direction at the slowest possible speed. When they got to halftime, they would turn a 97,000-ton ship around, and then chug back as fast as possible to where they began, while Recoil and other bands played. And then, when the game started again, they would set out again in that first TV-friendly heading at the slowest possible speed.</p><p begin="00:18:00.26" data-timestamp="1080.26">It's now just a few hours since we saw the resupply operation.

I find the entire subject so interesting that I bring it up the next place we visit, the ship's laundry. I'm having what I think is a perfectly innocent conversation with an airman named Jason [? Bess. ?] His regular job is to work on high-tech aviation electronics, but the way the Navy works is that when you first report to a ship, you do 90 days at one of the jobs that nobody signs up for when they join the Navy, that the Navy has to have someone do, or you can't actually run a navy-- cleaning, serving food, and doing laundry, thousands of pounds a day of laundry, stacked in bags to the ceiling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason</h4><p begin="00:20:57.05" data-timestamp="1257.05"> Right now I'm opening the dryer. This dryer holds about 100 pounds of laundry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:01.01" data-timestamp="1261.01">Jason, it turns out, actually doesn't mind his 90 days doing wash.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason</h4><p begin="00:21:03.98" data-timestamp="1263.98"> I don't know. I really like laundry, actually.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:06.00" data-timestamp="1266">Oh yeah?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason</h4><p begin="00:21:06.73" data-timestamp="1266.73"> Yeah. I feel good. It's just washing laundry. My regular job is really complicated, and sometimes I have a hard time comprehending all the electronical systems, and memorizing all the different systems, and the start-ups and all that. And laundry was a good break, because it's really simple. Here all you do is you just throw it in the washer, take it out of the wash, put it in the dryer. And there's not too much complication.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:31.76" data-timestamp="1291.76">And then, at the end of this perfectly nice conversation, I bring up the new thing that I'd learned just minutes before in the library.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:38.08" data-timestamp="1298.08">I've heard there's a lot of rumors on board a ship, like there's always rumors. What are some of the rumors that you've heard?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason</h4><p begin="00:21:44.65" data-timestamp="1304.65"> Oh, you always hear rumors about when we're going to pull in, when we're not going to pull in, when we're going to see a port. And a lot of rumors about when we're going home, because some people say we're going to stay longer. Some people say we may leave earlier. Rumors about like what ports that we're going to hit on the way back, because everybody wants to go to Australia. And of course you hear rumors about different girls and different guys sleeping together, and people getting in trouble and getting caught for that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:10.85" data-timestamp="1330.85">What happens if they caught for that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason</h4><p begin="00:22:12.57" data-timestamp="1332.57"> You get in a lot of trouble. You're not allowed to have any fraternization on the ship. That's another thing that's kind of rough. I haven't had much physical contact in a long time. Even just a hug every now and then, you're not really supposed to do that in uniform, and you're always in uniform. I miss affection a lot. I do. I grew up in a very affectionate home, and I'd like to just get a hug every now and then.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:37.76" data-timestamp="1357.76">Jason tells me another rumor or two he's heard, we say goodbye, and Wendy and Alex and I go down to get some food. Perhaps 15 minutes later, one of the public affairs officers informs me that Jason and I had been overheard talking about rumors on the <i>Stennis,</i> rumors about men and women sleeping together on board, and that within minutes this had been reported up the ranks, all the way to the ship's executive officer, the person who oversees the day to day operations of the <i>Stennis.</i> People were upset. What sort of story were we putting together anyway?</p><p begin="00:23:05.11" data-timestamp="1385.11">I won't bore you with the details of several rather tense conversations. Let's just say that we had inadvertently hit a nerve. It's been just eight years since women were first deployed on to combat ships and aircraft carriers, and just 10 years since the Navy was forced to rethink how women were treated in the service in the wake of the Tailhook scandal. This is all still enormously sensitive, sensitive enough that this conversation in the laundry was enough to raise red flags up and down the chain of command.</p><p begin="00:23:29.09" data-timestamp="1409.09">At some point, we're brought in without our tape recorders to meet the ship's executive officer, a friendly but tightly-wound man named Jeff Miller. And he explains that when new crew members arrive for duty on the <i>Stennis,</i> he personally gives the speech reiterating Navy policy on male-female relationships, a policy he sums up for them as no dating. A date, he tells them, is as simple as two people walking side by side closely, heads leaning together and talking. A date is when you sit too near each other. You should be a minimum, he tells them, of two butt-widths apart. When he spots crew members sitting closer than that, he'll ask them if it's a date, and when of course they say no, he'll tell them, well then make sure it doesn't look like a date.</p><p begin="00:24:06.54" data-timestamp="1446.54">Which all seems sensible enough. This is a workplace, like any other, and you can't sleep with people you work with. But consider what the Navy is up against in trying to make this policy work. 12% of the crew on the <i>Stennis</i> is female. The average age on board, as we said, is 21 years old. That is thousands of young people cooped up together in a close space for months at a time far from home. Trying to keep people from having sex with each other in that situation is in a sense fighting nature itself.</p><p begin="00:24:33.63" data-timestamp="1473.63">In any case, after that incident the public affairs officers felt that it was necessary to monitor our interviews a little more closely. Lieutenant Jeff Gorell, one of these very smart, very capable people saddled with the thankless job of escorting us around the ship, a job which the lieutenant compared to herding cats, was with me on the mess deck not long after all this came to pass. We had some time to kill, and I saw a group of talkative young sailors who looked like they might be talkative interviewees. I asked Lieutenant Gorell if it will be OK to talk with them, but worried about their big mouths, he steered me instead to a serious-looking sailor named Kevin [? Wrenn. ?] This turned out to be a mistake for poor Lieutenant Gorell.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kevin</h4><p begin="00:25:12.39" data-timestamp="1512.39"> I'm just ready to go home.

An aircraft carrier's main mission is to fly planes, but when you see what it takes to launch or land a jet on a boat, what you realize is that human beings should not be doing this at all. The runway is just too short. For the planes to get enough lift under their wings, the crew actually has to drive the boat at top speed into the wind. Then the front wheel of the plane is attached to machinery under the deck, the catapult, which literally flings it off the edge of the deck like a pebble from a slingshot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Wendy Dorr</h4><p begin="00:36:47.85" data-timestamp="2207.85">Landing the plane on the deck is much harder than taking off, and it's very, very dangerous.

None of them survived.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:11.40" data-timestamp="2231.4">Basically what you're trying to do is latch a hook that hangs from the back of your plane on to one of four cables that are stretched across the deck. An airman named Dave Cruz explains how it works. The pilot looks at something called the ball, which indicates if he's coming in on target, and talks to guys called LSOs-- they're fellow pilots actually, who stand right on deck.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Cruz</h4><p begin="00:37:28.85" data-timestamp="2248.85">And it's up to the LSOs to guide him in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:31.60" data-timestamp="2251.6">They're talking to him over the radio?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Cruz</h4><p begin="00:37:33.10" data-timestamp="2253.1">Right now they're talking to that next guy who are coming in, which is a Tomcat, which is 3/4 of a mile.

They're both reading the <i>Left</i> <i>Behind</i> series. He's on book two. She's on book four.

And I get out here, and all I've got to do is take care of myself, go to work, and go to sleep, kill time in between.

The room is quiet, aside from the pleasant electric hum of refrigerators and drink machines, and the far-off purring of the ship's engines. In the center of the room, five middle-aged men are sitting around one of the tables. It's their nightly card game. They're playing Hearts, and they're passing around a picture of someone jumping into the ocean during a recent break, when they were allowed to swim.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chief 1</h4><p begin="00:46:55.17" data-timestamp="2815.17">This is a perfect shot.

The enlisted, and you've met lots of them on today's show, usually come into the Navy at 18 or 19 years old, straight out of high school. Officers come into the Navy as officers, with higher rank and privileges. The chiefs are the highest-ranking enlisted people, and anyone in the Navy will tell you they run the Navy. They're the buffer between the bosses and the people who actually do the work.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chief 4</h4><p begin="00:48:33.82" data-timestamp="2913.82">We have to keep the high-echelon people from bothering these guys.

They need to cry on your shoulder, you let them cry on your shoulder. You need to kick them in the butt, you kick them in the butt. You listen to their problems. You talk to them. You try to help them, and that's probably what most of us spend most our time doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:10.25" data-timestamp="2950.25">Every day, The Don says, somebody comes to him with a problem back home they need to solve, and The Don-- his real name is Brent-- helps them out. Often this means getting on the phone and contacting another chief out there somewhere. There's a whole chief-to-chief network.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brent</h4><p begin="00:49:23.69" data-timestamp="2963.69">The chief that I need to talk to knows somebody at the command, and they can talk to that chief, who can get this whole thing going. It's a fraternity. We work together, and that's one of the biggest things about being a chief. We are one.</p><p begin="00:49:45.37" data-timestamp="2985.37">The goal-- once you start out in the Navy, if you have a good chief from the beginning, your goal is to be a chief. I mean, your goal is to be that chief. And for me that was the goal.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:57.62" data-timestamp="2997.62">Who was your chief?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brent</h4><p begin="00:49:59.76" data-timestamp="2999.76">It was a guy named Chief Womack. He was my first chief in the Navy, and he was there anytime I needed anything. He was always there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:50:19.48" data-timestamp="3019.48">Late one night, Lieutenant Gorell and a TV crew from San Diego and I are on our way back to the staterooms, when Gorell invites us into the officer's mess for a bowl of cereal before bed. Inside there's a group of officers talking at another table, and one enlisted man breaking down the serving line. It's late, and most of the people in the ship are in bed.</p><p begin="00:50:37.76" data-timestamp="3037.76">So we're eating cereal and talking when the enlisted man appears with a huge tray of food. We all look at each other. No one asked him to fix us anything. Just thought you all might like a snack, sir, the enlisted man says to Gorell, and puts the tray on our table. The tray contains 12 chicken breast sandwiches, each with lettuce and a slice of American cheese on hamburger buns. There are four of us, and we already have our cereal. Apparently, the Powell Doctrine of overwhelming force applies to food service as well.</p><p begin="00:51:03.82" data-timestamp="3063.82">Later in our cabin, Wendy, Ira, and I talk it over. Being on an aircraft carrier, we're surrounded on all sides by the lopsidedness of American military superiority. Just the very fact of the carrier itself-- no other country even has one like the <i>Stennis.</i> The US has 12. But it's the chicken sandwiches which somehow make that fact real.</p><p begin="00:51:23.41" data-timestamp="3083.41">Such is the size and strength of the attention to detail, which fully conveys the sheer uncontested might of the American military. Not only does the Navy give each pilot one of the fastest, most expensive fighter planes in the world to fly, not only does it provide him with the most accurate bombs in the history of warfare to drop, it also feeds him at any hour of the day more chicken sandwiches than you can possibly eat. It gives him a room to hang out in, with his own official nickname on the chair, and a practice space for his band. Someone, somewhere, stitches Monkey Butt into his flight suit. The other countries don't have a chance.</p><p begin="00:52:03.65" data-timestamp="3123.65">You've never slept in bunk beds with your boss until you've slept in bunk beds with your boss on an aircraft carrier. By Navy standards, the room Ira and I shared was luxurious, only two of us, not 200 or 600. But the problem with the room, everybody warned us, was that it was right below the flight deck, and it could get kind of loud. And sure enough, we were woken up several times that first night by the thumps and the clanks of the planes landing and taking off. Still, we figured, we could manage.</p><p begin="00:52:28.79" data-timestamp="3148.79">Then, the second night, a bus ran full speed into the wall by my head. That's what it sounded like. Like the steel wall six inches from the top of my head had just suffered a collision with a very fast-moving bus. It was the loudest sound I'd ever heard.</p><p begin="00:52:42.65" data-timestamp="3162.65">And here's what it's like to be in a bunk bed with your boss on an aircraft carrier when you've just heard the loudest sound you've ever heard, if your boss is my boss. What happened next was this: the loudest sound I'd ever heard happened again. And I have to stress, this is not a normal loud sound, like a rock band or a car horn or even a stick of dynamite exploding. This is a sound that's only made when things that shouldn't happen happen. It's the sound of disaster, of destruction. It is the sound of catastrophe.</p><p begin="00:53:09.35" data-timestamp="3189.35">I lay there stunned for a second, and then I heard Ira jerk into action, saw his feet swing down from the top bunk. I actually said the words, "You're right man," as I threw off my blanket and started to run. And then I looked behind me, and I saw Ira digging through his equipment. And I realized I was running for the door, and Ira was running for his tape recorder.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:29.82" data-timestamp="3209.82">One two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. [INAUDIBLE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:53:36.29" data-timestamp="3216.29">While we waited for the loud sound to happen again, Ira and I handed the microphone back and forth between our bunks and recorded our conversation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:53:42.26" data-timestamp="3222.26">If there was a problem, though, there would be alarms going off and stuff, right? I mean, it just wouldn't just be like a horrible accident and then nothing-- and then no sound, right? They'd be saying, all hands to your stations, that sort of thing, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:06.37" data-timestamp="3246.37">I'm sure if it really gets bad around here, there's bells of some sort.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:54:11.55" data-timestamp="3251.55">The loud sound never happened again, and eventually we fell sleep, though Ira left the tape recorder running just in case. We were out for maybe half an hour when we were woken up again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pa System</h4><p begin="00:54:21.88" data-timestamp="3261.88"> [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] control.

Reactor mechanical and casualty assistance teams, report to number two reactor room." Casualty assistance teams? That can't be good, right? After half an hour in which I tried to convince myself that my stomach ache was not radiation sickness, and Ira tried to figure out how he could get down to the ship's nuclear reactors to report on the accident, another PA announcement came on, just like the first, but with one additional sentence.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pa System</h4><p begin="00:55:02.66" data-timestamp="3302.66">Reactor mechanical casualty assistance team, layer number two, reactor room.

That was a routine test for one of the catapults, and the PA announcement had been a routine drill. The two things were totally unrelated. Both things, they said, happened almost every day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:35.84" data-timestamp="3335.84">Thank you very much, Alex, for that report.</p><p begin="00:55:38.88" data-timestamp="3338.88">There's one more thing that happened on the <i>Stennis</i> that I keep thinking about in the weeks since we returned. It was at the end of our very last day there, which meant 10:40 in the morning. And Barbara Mendoza, the chief who had been kind enough to invite us to the chief's mess, took Alex and Wendy and I outside to the very back of the ship, the fantail, looking at the water and the sky. It's one of her favorite places on the <i>Stennis.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barbara Mendoza</h4><p begin="00:55:59.25" data-timestamp="3359.25">I come out here every day before I go to bed.
