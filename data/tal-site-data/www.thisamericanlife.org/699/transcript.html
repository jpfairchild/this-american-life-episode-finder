<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.14" data-timestamp="1.14"> Hi, everybody. Ira Glass here. So our staff is busy reporting out stories for next week's show and for other upcoming shows. And we had a rerun scheduled for this week, and we decided in this stressful time it might be nice to keep things light and funny. And so that's what this episode is.</p><p begin="00:00:16.47" data-timestamp="16.47">And it has not one, but two of the most popular stories we have ever put on the air. The first version of this episode was broadcast over 20 years ago, back when we were distributed by Public Radio International and our episodes began with a little PRI audio logo, which-- I don't know-- I kind of miss.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:36.09" data-timestamp="36.09"> From PRI, Public Radio International.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:00:38.73" data-timestamp="38.73"> From PRI, Public Radio International.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:39.90" data-timestamp="39.9"> From PRI, Public Radio International.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:00:41.82" data-timestamp="41.82"> Public Radio.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:42.84" data-timestamp="42.84"> Public--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 3</h4><p begin="00:00:44.10" data-timestamp="44.1"> Radio International.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:44.49" data-timestamp="44.49"> --Radio International.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 3</h4><p begin="00:00:45.87" data-timestamp="45.87"> One more time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:48.18" data-timestamp="48.18"> What could be more American than the person who sees something they've never done before, dreams they could do it, goes after that dream? Well, let's begin today with a woman who dreams of directing a play in the small town where she lives, a college town, somewhere below the Mason-Dixon line in the hills of Appalachia, a town which will remain, for our purposes today, unnamed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:01:09.99" data-timestamp="69.99"> I don't think she had ever directed. And she claimed to have acted. And it was never really quite clear just what her credentials were. But she had managed to convince the local theater department of this college that she should direct a production of <i>Peter</i> <i>Pan.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:28.53" data-timestamp="88.53"> When he was in the 10th grade in 1973, Jack Hitt saw her production. And like everybody else in town, you heard about it for weeks beforehand.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:01:37.98" data-timestamp="97.98"> Slowly, but surely, you began to hear sort of rumors about this production. For example, I know that they had spent a lot of money renting these flying apparatuses out of New York. And apparently there's like one company and a handful of these apparatuses. And so to get them was a major coup.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:56.65" data-timestamp="116.65"> This is a story not just of a mediocre play or a terrible play. When it comes right down to it, it's not even a story about a play. This is a story about a fiasco and about what makes a fiasco. And one ingredient of many fiascos is that great, massive, heart-wrenching chaos and failure are more likely to occur when great ambition has come into play, when plans are big, expectations great, hopes at their highest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:02:25.56" data-timestamp="145.56"> And what you have to understand is that everybody in this sort of community understood that they were-- there was certainly a sort of air of everyone sort of reaching beyond their own grasp. Every actor was sort of in a role that was just a little too big for them. Every aspect of the set and the crew-- and rumors had sort of cooked around. There was this huge crew. There were lots of things being painted.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:52.14" data-timestamp="172.14"> See, but this, in fact, is one of the criteria for greatness, is that everyone is just about to reach just beyond their grasp, because that is when greatness can occur.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:03:00.24" data-timestamp="180.24"> That's right. That's right. And maybe greatness could have occurred.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:13.77" data-timestamp="193.77"> Well, today on our program, what happens when greatness does not occur? What happens, in fact, when fumble leads to error leads to mishap and before you know it you have left the realm of ordinary mistake and chaos, and you have entered into the more ethereal, specialized realm of fiasco? Today's show, "Fiascos-- A Philosophical Inquiry," perhaps the first ever, as far as we know, into what makes a fiasco, what takes our ordinary lives that extra distance into fiasco.</p><p begin="00:03:48.23" data-timestamp="228.23">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. There is much, much more to learn about fiascos in this hour. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Opening Night</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:10.26" data-timestamp="250.26"> We begin our show with this true fable of <i>Peter</i> <i>Pan</i> in Act One, "Opening Night."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:04:40.24" data-timestamp="280.24"> Opening night comes and, you know, well, almost everybody in the area in the 10-mile radius of this theater knows somebody in this production, so the place is pretty much packed. And I don't know if you remember the opening moment of <i>Peter</i> <i>Pan,</i> but it's the three little kids sleeping in their bed. And Peter Pan comes flying in the window. And in this particular production, there's a big bed with all the three kids in it. And off to the left, I remember, is a big, huge wardrobe, and there's a large window there and a little bureau.</p><p begin="00:05:16.30" data-timestamp="316.3">And Peter Pan comes in and has a little speech where he says, anybody can fly. Why, with just a little magic dust, one can fly. And Peter Pan sort of sprinkles this magic dust in the air. And sure enough, the kids sort of suddenly just lurch into the air.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:33.55" data-timestamp="333.55"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:05:34.09" data-timestamp="334.09"> And it becomes clear right away that the people that they've hired to run these flying apparatuses really aren't quite clear on how they actually work. So instead of the kids sort of sailing gracefully to and fro, they sort of hang in the air like puppets, just sort of dangling there and sort of getting jerked up an inch or two or back and forth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:54.61" data-timestamp="354.61"> And then sometimes they're just stationary?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:05:57.04" data-timestamp="357.04"> Yeah, just hanging there like a spider. And then several of them start to sort of circumscribe these circles in the air, where it's clear that the people running the machines have just sort of set them off on these oval courses that spiral farther and farther out.</p><p begin="00:06:21.12" data-timestamp="381.12">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:06:22.79" data-timestamp="382.79">And if you were sitting in the audience, there was clearly a sense of fear on the faces of these people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:31.07" data-timestamp="391.07"> Of the actors?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:06:32.03" data-timestamp="392.03"> The actors. The actors, actually, you could sense their lack of confidence, shall we say--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:37.83" data-timestamp="397.83"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:06:38.30" data-timestamp="398.3"> --in the people running the machines in the back. So they--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:42.78" data-timestamp="402.78"> Wait, wait. And the audience reaction to this point is just-- are they laughing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:06:47.51" data-timestamp="407.51"> No one is laughing. One of the great things about audiences, especially in a live theater production, is that they're very forgiving. They want the show to work. And so everyone is sort of gripping their chair a little tightly. We feel for them. They're up there-- they're embarrassing themselves for us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:05.55" data-timestamp="425.55"> We identify with them. We become them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:07:08.70" data-timestamp="428.7"> And so the audience, I think, was very forgiving and very understanding of this moment. But there was one moment in this first opening scene that kind of put the audience on notice. And that's when, as the kids are sort of jerking up and down, and swinging back and forth, and sort of going around in these ovals, at one point the littlest one, the little boy, is sort of being flung around a little too--</p><p begin="00:07:33.38" data-timestamp="453.38">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:07:35.35" data-timestamp="455.35">--a little too hard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:37.19" data-timestamp="457.19"> Well, he has the least mass to resist, whatever the machinery is doing to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:07:41.34" data-timestamp="461.34"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:42.40" data-timestamp="462.4"> OK, so and?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:07:43.28" data-timestamp="463.28"> And so he's flying around in a circle. And the audience sort of sees this coming. And there's a real sense of pain, and gripping of the chair, and white-knuckledness as the kid suddenly does just an enormous splat into the wardrobe. And it's clear that he's hurt.</p><p begin="00:07:59.81" data-timestamp="479.81">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:08:02.06" data-timestamp="482.06">And he comes off of it sort of a little dazed. And then, of course, he's jerked up in the air a little bit and often a little too high so that he's suddenly sort of in the workings. He's sort of left the stage itself. He's now up there with the lights.

But like I say, the audience was still in this very forgiving mode.</p><p begin="00:08:41.39" data-timestamp="521.39">And no one said a word. We just all sat there sort of holding our breath. And there's that weird tension of being in the audience thinking, oh, oh my goodness. They have gotten off to a very bad start. Oh, this is not good.

So the high school students, couple of college students maybe, they started to laugh out loud. And I'll be honest, Ira, I might have been one of those first people to laugh. I was in the 10th grade.

And she spots a kite that's flying by, and she's supposed to grab it and attach it to her back and fly off.</p><p begin="00:15:47.27" data-timestamp="947.27">Well, of course, the kite is attached to the flying apparatus line. And it gets closer and closer to her. She's standing on this little papier-mach&#233; hill. But the flying apparatus people can't quite get it close enough to her to reach. So she has to step out into the water that she's just told us is filled with crocodiles to grab it. She finally gets the kite. And when she yanks on it, it pops off the flying apparatus. And the hook goes zinging up into the lights and catches.</p><p begin="00:16:17.16" data-timestamp="977.16">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:16:19.58" data-timestamp="979.58">So now there is this big loop of wire hanging in front of the stage, and there's Wendy holding the kite. And she ad libbed as best she could, as I remember. She sort of said, on second thought, maybe I can swim. And with that, she walked off the stage, sort of motioning her arms like you would do the swim, the dance in 1965.</p><p begin="00:16:52.45" data-timestamp="1012.45">So she does that. At this point, I mean, the actors are just falling apart. They are so frightened of the audience. There are just belly laughs rolling up to the stage from the audience. People are howling with laughter at every mistake.</p><p begin="00:17:06.66" data-timestamp="1026.66">And now any small mistake just takes on these-- any instigation for laughter is just enough for this audience. And now the old people have given it up. Everyone has quit being nice. Now there's just this kind of frightening roar that comes from the audience every time there's a mistake.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:25.71" data-timestamp="1045.71"> Well, what happened?

This is a fiasco.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:17:32.30" data-timestamp="1052.3"> Yeah, this is a fiasco.

Now the reason they're there is to chronicle these embarrassments. This is why I have remembered this play for 25 years. Towards act three, the director had decided that she wanted to break down the fourth wall. This was cutting edge theater, as far as she was concerned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:23.16" data-timestamp="1103.16"> Before you do this, I just want to explain-- when we say breaking down the fourth wall, what we mean is the wall between the actors and the audience. Usually it's impermeable, but then there came a point in the late '60s, early '70s where a lot of theaters, basically the actors would come out into the audience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:18:37.72" data-timestamp="1117.72"> That's right, and interact with the audience, and break down that wall, so the idea being that you would get more in touch with the dramatic sense and the reality of what was happening. Anyway, so in this particular scene, what was going to happen was that the Indians were going to throw rope ladders down from the balcony, and climb down these rope ladders into the audience, and move among the audience, and frighten us. Anyway, I knew about this scene because my friend David, who I went to high school with, was in it. So when David was climbing over the top of this balcony to climb down the rope, he lost his footing and fell to the floor from the balcony, a distance of about 15 to 20 feet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:23.01" data-timestamp="1163.01"> Oh my god.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:19:24.27" data-timestamp="1164.27"> A good fall.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:25.08" data-timestamp="1165.08"> That's horrible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:19:25.83" data-timestamp="1165.83"> Yeah. And he landed on both of his feet and sprained both of his ankles, and, of course, curled into a fetal position and began to cry. He was really, really hurt.</p><p begin="00:19:37.05" data-timestamp="1177.05">Now, to appreciate the horrible moment I'm now describing, also understand that it's a Friday night, we are in a college town, and there is a volunteer fire and ambulance department. And in order to summon the rescuers from wherever they are, an alarm is sounded that can be heard for five miles. That alarm is located right over this theater.</p><p begin="00:20:03.00" data-timestamp="1203">So the alarm goes off, OK? This is an air raid siren. It is so loud, you can put your fingers in your ear and it's still hurting your ears. We're right under it. It can be heard for five miles.</p><p begin="00:20:16.58" data-timestamp="1216.58">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:20:18.37" data-timestamp="1218.37"></p><p begin="00:20:20.65" data-timestamp="1220.65">And then, of course, three minutes later, busting through the door of the theater, are these 15 firemen, who are in boots, hats. They got hoses. They don't know what it is. All they know is that they've been sent out on a call. And to sort of add to the chaos, the director, of course, has sort of flogged the actors that the show must go on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:44.26" data-timestamp="1244.26"> No matter what.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:20:44.86" data-timestamp="1244.86"> So no matter what. So while all of this is happening and several people are attending to David, and other people have just now decided that since the firemen are here he's going to be fine, they can start laughing. And now the audience has just completely lost control. People are standing up in their seats and shouting for more. They want blood. I mean, at this point, people are actually injured in the production, and they want more. Somehow that's how this entire play ended.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:25.96" data-timestamp="1285.96"> What's interesting about this as a fiasco-- I feel like the thing it makes me understand about fiascos is that the fiasco itself is an altered state. That is, all the normal rules are off. You have left the normal rules of how the audience is going to interact with the actors.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:21:39.55" data-timestamp="1299.55"> Right. I've never seen a production like this, and I've never seen an audience collapse like this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:45.07" data-timestamp="1305.07"> See, but I wonder, when you think about what people go to theater for, like what kind of release people want, I mean, people want an experience that will take them out of themselves. We all want an experience that will take us out of ourselves and into another place and another reality. And it sounds like this production, even though it was a fiasco, in fact, because it was a fiasco, was more successful at that than any conventional play could be.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:22:11.41" data-timestamp="1331.41"> Well, see, I would disagree with you. See, I think the old theater critics, the ancients, would say that the reason you go to the theater and to see a great production is to be-- I think the word they used to use is "transported," the idea being that you would be lifted away from your animal nature and into these higher, more spiritual realms or get in touch with these greater tragic emotions. Of course, what happened here was the exact opposite. We get transported directly in touch with our animal being.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:41.82" data-timestamp="1361.82"> Our baser selves.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:22:43.48" data-timestamp="1363.48"> Right.

<h3>Act Two: Squirrel Cop</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:02.46" data-timestamp="1442.46"> Act Two, "Squirrel Cop." Well, human error is often at the heart of a fiasco, but what happens when you combine human error with, what we'll call in this case, animal error? We have this story of a police officer in a suburban community on the East Coast.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:24:19.11" data-timestamp="1459.11"> There was nothing, nothing going on-- Saturday night in this village, really quiet, super cold. And this call came over for unknown animal in a house. And it was on my post. It was about five minutes away. So myself and another car were assigned the call, and we show up there.</p><p begin="00:24:41.54" data-timestamp="1481.54">And luckily for me, it was another guy who was pretty new. So we walk up to the door with all our stuff on-- the nylon coat, the vest, the belt, the whole nine yards. And the door opens. And the guy who is behind the door, he's about 30. I was 23 at the time.</p><p begin="00:24:59.29" data-timestamp="1499.29">He's about 30. He looks like a broker or a lawyer, just really well put together, nice guy, wearing glasses. He's wearing these silk pajamas with a monogram. Got my attention.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:08.92" data-timestamp="1508.92"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:25:09.52" data-timestamp="1509.52"> And he's going, listen, really sorry to bother you. Normally I'd handle this sort of stuff on my own, but my wife really insisted that I call. And so we ask him what the problem is.</p><p begin="00:25:21.11" data-timestamp="1521.11">He says, well, we were having kind of a romantic evening down in the living room, and we heard this scratching upstairs. So I ran upstairs to see what it was. And it turns out it's coming from the attic. There's something up there, and it's just running around, knocking a few small things over. I can't tell what it is. It could be a squirrel, a raccoon. I really don't know.</p><p begin="00:25:40.68" data-timestamp="1540.68">So the other cop that I was with said, well, we really don't handle that. It's not so much a police function. But we do have numbers of these private contractors who will come in, and they'll put a humane trap down, and they'll remove the animal for you. And it's really not such a big deal, but it's really not our thing.</p><p begin="00:25:57.98" data-timestamp="1557.98">So right as he was in the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook, the guy swings the door back. And there's his wife, who was just beautiful. She was beautiful. She was probably about 26 or 27, but just really beautiful, like perfect skin, long blonde hair, great teeth, brilliant blue eyes, a really nice smile, just beautiful and friendly. If she had said, eat this broken glass, I just would have said, OK, broken glass it is. That's fine.</p><p begin="00:26:31.76" data-timestamp="1591.76">But she seemed really nice, so I was going to be like Galahad. So I just threw my arm back into this guy's chest, into my partner's chest. I said, Mark, we can handle this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:44.48" data-timestamp="1604.48"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:26:46.85" data-timestamp="1606.85"> It'll be OK. And she was just, you know, thank you so much. And she was really sweet. And I was struck dead.</p><p begin="00:26:59.30" data-timestamp="1619.3">So we walk inside. And she goes, I'm going to throw a pot of coffee on. And we go upstairs. We follow the man of the house upstairs. And we're underneath one of those trap doors that goes into the attic with a staircase that folds out.</p><p begin="00:27:13.73" data-timestamp="1633.73">And we do hear an animal upstairs scratching away, just scuttling around the floor. And there's definitely something up there, and it's making pretty good speed up going from one end of the roof to the other. So I reached up, and I took the trapdoor down. We unfolded the ladder. And I have this big, heavy flashlight, like your cop flashlight-- 4D cells, the metal case, the whole thing.</p><p begin="00:27:36.87" data-timestamp="1656.87">I shine it up through the hole in there, and it's pretty black. I can see the rafters, but really nothing else around there. And I start up the ladder.</p><p begin="00:27:45.77" data-timestamp="1665.77">Now the guy who owned the house is standing almost directly underneath me, just to the side of the ladder, looking straight up at me. And my partner's at the base of the ladder, right behind me. So just before I stuck my head through this black hole, I just paused. I crunched my body up underneath 'cause I'm realizing, gee, I don't know where this thing is. The second we pull down the trap door, all noise upstairs just ceased.</p><p begin="00:28:08.49" data-timestamp="1688.49">So I was kind of nervous. And I was like, well, I look like an idiot just crouched up here on the top of the ladder. So I took the flashlight, and I just popped my head up, turned the light on again. And about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel at eye level with me, kind of reared back on its legs. And I swear, from where I was standing, it looked like Godzilla.</p><p begin="00:28:35.80" data-timestamp="1715.8">It just scared the heck out of me. I thought, it's a squirrel. It's going to be hiding somewhere. It's going to be terrified of me. It was six inches away from me.</p><p begin="00:28:42.58" data-timestamp="1722.58">And it really startled me, so I kind of went, ah, and jumped back. And the flashlight slips out of my hands. It's heavy. And it falls directly onto the nose of the guy who's looking straight up at me. And I don't think it broke it, but it did some damage. And his nose-- his hands went up to his face. Blood just started pouring out between his hands.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:03.34" data-timestamp="1743.34"> This is the homeowner?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:29:04.30" data-timestamp="1744.3"> This is the homeowner. I lose my balance and fall backwards directly onto my partner. And I pancake him.</p><p begin="00:29:11.56" data-timestamp="1751.56">We're both on our backs. He's on his back. I'm on his stomach on my back, scuttling around like a beetle trying to get up in this really narrow hallway. It's a mess. The squirrel, while we're floundering around in the hallway, jumps down the stairs-- boink, boink, boink-- lands on me, and takes off down the stairs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:32.05" data-timestamp="1772.05"> How undignified.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:29:34.08" data-timestamp="1774.08"> It was terrible. It was terrible.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:36.10" data-timestamp="1776.1"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:29:37.52" data-timestamp="1777.52"> So we're wondering, gee, where is the squirrel? And right at that second, the woman who lived there, you hear her scream. So my partner goes, well, we found the squirrel. It's wherever she is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:51.69" data-timestamp="1791.69"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:29:52.15" data-timestamp="1792.15"> So we go running downstairs. And the squirrel had come into the living room, where they had been having their romantic evening. They had a fire going. They had pillows arranged around one corner of the couch next to the fire. And they had champagne flutes out-- nice house, really nice. I mean, it just smelled brand new-- new carpeting, new rugs, new paint. They hadn't been there for that long.</p><p begin="00:30:18.37" data-timestamp="1818.37">So the squirrel, when it bolted down the staircase, took off into the living room and ran underneath a couch for cover. So we run downstairs. This guy is bleeding all over the place, on his carpets. His wife looks and says, what have you done to my husband?</p><p begin="00:30:33.94" data-timestamp="1833.94">I start going, oh, it was an accident. And I just stop in mid-sentence. What's the point? We've only been there about two minutes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:38.99" data-timestamp="1838.99"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:30:40.81" data-timestamp="1840.81"> So the squirrel is underneath the couch. And my partner is going, let's get out of here. This is just-- it's not going well. So I'm not beaten yet. I always have another idea.</p><p begin="00:30:56.02" data-timestamp="1856.02">So the squirrel is under this couch, which is in the middle of the room. So I have this bright idea. Why don't we move the furniture away from one of the corners, and we'll put the couch in the corner, and the squirrel will probably move along with the couch because it's the only cover available to it. And once we get into the corner, we'll only have two open sides of the couch to worry about. So we did that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:14.44" data-timestamp="1874.44"> That is so tactical.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:31:16.87" data-timestamp="1876.87"> Yes. Yeah, I was very proud of myself at that instant, but, you know. I asked her for a box, and she says, sure, we've got boxes. We just moved in. We have nothing but boxes.</p><p begin="00:31:25.81" data-timestamp="1885.81">She runs out to the garage, and she comes back with a box. And the box is long enough, and it fits across the entire short side of the couch where the armrest would be. So I start sweeping underneath the couch with my nightstick, trying to move the squirrel toward the box, figuring we'll capture it and just get rid of it, and we'll be out of here, and there'll be no more mayhem.</p><p begin="00:31:48.86" data-timestamp="1908.86">So it's actually working very well, and the squirrel's moving down along. You can hear it. It's chittering. And I'm trying not to hurt it.</p><p begin="00:31:54.84" data-timestamp="1914.84">I'm nervous about the thing. It might bite me. I don't want to hurt it, really. It's just an animal.</p><p begin="00:32:01.07" data-timestamp="1921.07">So I'm moving it along, and everything's going very well. And then with about eight inches to go I took one more swipe, and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch. It was lined with tassels. I couldn't really see under the couch. It bolted out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace, which is about three feet away. The fireplace was directly ahead of it. And it ran into the fire--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:22.72" data-timestamp="1942.72"> Oh, my.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:32:23.47" data-timestamp="1943.47"> --and caught on fire, and ran directly back out and directly back under the couch.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:31.45" data-timestamp="1951.45"> Is it on fire?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:32:31.93" data-timestamp="1951.93"> It was on fire, yeah, the tail, the bushy fur, the whole bit. I mean, it wasn't flaming or anything, but it was smoking, and there was a little bit of fire coming off the tail. So it runs back under the couch. And the couch catches on fire in seconds, I mean, in seconds. It must have had dust under there or something else, but it caught on fire immediately.</p><p begin="00:32:56.17" data-timestamp="1976.17">And my partner and I just don't even talk.</p><p begin="00:32:59.68" data-timestamp="1979.68">We just grab the couch, heave it upside down, and now there's plenty of oxygen now for the fire to really get going. And it starts up, and we're patting it out. And it's sort of getting away from us. So we grab the only thing that's really available, and those are these really nice silk pillows. And we have one in each hand, both of us, and we're just windmilling away at this fire on the couch. And we put it out, but it's smoking terribly.</p><p begin="00:33:28.96" data-timestamp="2008.96">It was a disaster. The couch is upside down. The bottom of it is burnt. The house is filling with smoke from the couch.</p><p begin="00:33:36.49" data-timestamp="2016.49">The squirrel, when it went under the couch, in its death throes, just latched onto the bottom of the couch. It's like this smoking piece of gristle underneath the couch, latched on there with its claws. And we're pounding, smearing it all over the place.</p><p begin="00:33:50.71" data-timestamp="2030.71">The smoke alarms are firing away. The guy's standing with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose, which is still bleeding. His pajamas are a mess. They're covered with blood, the front of them.</p><p begin="00:34:00.46" data-timestamp="2040.46">And we finally get the fire out. And we're both completely red, sweating because we're dressed for like zero-degree weather, and it's hot there by the fire. We're mortified. The house is full of smoke.</p><p begin="00:34:16.36" data-timestamp="2056.36">The wife just looks around and just starts to cry. She goes, what have you done? What have you done to my house? You could see her just clicking things off on her fingers-- OK, the dead squirrel, ruined pillows, need a new couch. The walls are covered with soot. The fire alarm's going off. My husband's disfigured.</p><p begin="00:34:34.27" data-timestamp="2074.27">And then she really just lost it. And he was just looking at us and shaking his head like he couldn't believe that these two idiots showed up and did this to his house over nothing, really. And he just goes, you really haven't done anything wrong. I can't point to any one thing that you did that I have a reason to get angry about. You really haven't done anything wrong. I mean, we did call you, but I just-- I can't thank you for this.</p><p begin="00:35:07.64" data-timestamp="2107.64">They call for a squirrel. They end up with like $3,000, $4,000 worth of damage and a broken nose. And this is all within about five minutes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:22.44" data-timestamp="2122.44"> Could that have happened to you now, 13 years later?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer</h4><p begin="00:35:27.21" data-timestamp="2127.21"> There's always a new mistake to be made.

But there's things that just either they aren't your responsibility-- if you get involved in things that aren't your responsibility, or that you're really not equipped to handle, or that you don't have a specific plan, a plan that's thought through to a conclusion, you probably should re-evaluate what you're doing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:12.39" data-timestamp="2172.39"> Now that you mention that, yeah, that's right.

<h3>Act Three: Tragedy Minus Comedy Equals Time</h3>

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:08.60" data-timestamp="2288.6"> It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, fiasco. This is our own inquiry into the nature of what makes a fiasco. When you have left the world of mishaps, stumble human error, and you enter into the much more rarefied realm of fiasco, we have arrived at Act Three of our program-- Act Three, "Tragedy Minus Comedy Equals Time," specifically a long, long time between laughs.</p><p begin="00:38:37.68" data-timestamp="2317.68">So Mike Birbiglia is a comedian. He's been on our show lots of times. And years ago, years ago, he told this story about this one gig that he did relatively early in his career. He says it was the worst show he's ever done in his life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:38:51.84" data-timestamp="2331.84"> It happened this year. I was asked to perform at a charity golf tournament in New Jersey. So I woke up for this charity golf event. And I realized recently that I'm not a good adult yet. I think if you're a good adult, you plan your outfit according to what will occur when you leave the house. But I don't have that part of my brain. I'm just like, one outfit forever!</p><p begin="00:39:15.74" data-timestamp="2355.74">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:39:17.50" data-timestamp="2357.5"></p><p begin="00:39:18.82" data-timestamp="2358.82">So when I played golf, I brought my brother, Joe. And Joe's kind of like a bad entourage member. He's never like, you the man, Mike. He's always like, I don't know what Dad would think about this, and do you think they have any more shrimp-- that kind of thing. But we showed up to play golf, and they paired us up with these two other people. It was a celebrity tournament, and people were like, who do you think our celebrity's going to be?</p><p begin="00:39:49.76" data-timestamp="2389.76">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:39:51.73" data-timestamp="2391.73"></p><p begin="00:39:58.15" data-timestamp="2398.15">And Joe and I were like, yeah, who do you think our celebrity is going to be? And then I'm like, oh, no. I think it might be me. And then I'm apologizing to these people. I'm like, I'm really sorry I'm your celebrity. If you think this is disappointing for you, you can't imagine how I feel.</p><p begin="00:40:24.54" data-timestamp="2424.54">So I'm apologizing the whole day. And then at the end of the day, sure enough, my pants are all wrinkled, and I have to perform at this semi-formal banquet. And I'm like, what about one outfit forever? I thought that was a good plan.</p><p begin="00:40:38.97" data-timestamp="2438.97">And so here's what I do. As damage control, I go to the locker room to iron my own pants. And yeah, it's a pretty good plan. And I find an iron, but I couldn't find a board. So I take off my pants. I'm just ironing them on a bench in the locker room in my underwear, which is a dead giveaway that these are my only pants.</p><p begin="00:41:05.88" data-timestamp="2465.88">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:41:07.35" data-timestamp="2467.35"></p><p begin="00:41:09.76" data-timestamp="2469.76">So I'm ironing my pants. And I put them on. And I go up to the event. And this is where the trouble really begins. It's important for me, before I tell you this part of the story, to remind you that you're on my side.</p><p begin="00:41:29.66" data-timestamp="2489.66">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:41:31.53" data-timestamp="2491.53"></p><p begin="00:41:36.20" data-timestamp="2496.2">I say to the woman in charge-- I go, what's the format of the show? And she goes, well, there's two speakers, and then you, and then a raffle. And I was like, well, that's exciting because I've never opened for a raffle. I'm trying to stay optimistic. And I'm sitting in the back of the room with my brother, Joe. And the first speaker comes on the stage, and he's an 11-year-old boy who survived leukemia.</p><p begin="00:42:04.07" data-timestamp="2524.07">[AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING]</p><p begin="00:42:05.93" data-timestamp="2525.93">I know.</p><p begin="00:42:06.76" data-timestamp="2526.76">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:42:08.51" data-timestamp="2528.51"></p><p begin="00:42:09.83" data-timestamp="2529.83">He's not funny at all.</p><p begin="00:42:11.42" data-timestamp="2531.42">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:42:13.20" data-timestamp="2533.2"></p><p begin="00:42:18.13" data-timestamp="2538.13">He focuses primarily on the leukemia, and everyone is crying. Literally everyone is crying. I'm even crying in the back of the room for two reasons-- one, the kid, and two, for me because I have to perform comedy.

Clearly the show is over. Surely there can't be anyone more famous than Hall of Fame quarterback Phil Simms. But wait, there was. It was Mike Birbiglia, who had no business being at this event.</p><p begin="00:44:13.93" data-timestamp="2653.93">I know there are some entertainers who might have risen to the challenge, and I would love to be one of those entertainers, but I am not. As a matter of fact, I have a habit in my life of making awkward situations even more awkward. I've said this before, but a few years ago I was moving a new bed into my apartment. And this woman who lived in the building opened the front door for me with her key. And she goes, I'm not worried because a rapist wouldn't have a bed like that.</p><p begin="00:44:46.46" data-timestamp="2686.46">That's how she started the conversation. Now, what I should have said was nothing.

You're just like, see you around the building, that kind of thing. I've thought about this a lot, and I think there's something wrong with my brain, where I don't have an on-deck circle for ideas. It's just batter up.</p><p begin="00:45:23.80" data-timestamp="2723.8">And a lot of the ideas are bad. And they're at the plate going, I don't know about this one, Mike. And I just turn into this drunk Little League dad.

It's a very neat thing. And when they don't, it feels like you're performing jazz because they're kind of bobbing their head and looking to the side. And sometimes that's OK. I'm like, I like jazz.</p><p begin="00:46:00.63" data-timestamp="2760.63">But then I get worried because I'm like, sometimes jazz sucks. What if I'm the Kenny G of comedy? What if I think I sound like this, like-- [JAZZ SOUNDS]</p><p begin="00:46:10.92" data-timestamp="2770.92"></p><p begin="00:46:13.45" data-timestamp="2773.45">--and, in fact, I sound like this-- (SINGING) Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

George Clooney, Barbra Streisand, Jennifer Aniston, Vidal Sassoon, Jodie Foster, Jason Momoa, Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves, Sharon Stone, and John Travolta, also George Burns, Bob Hope, Gene Kelly, Gena Rowlands, also Quentin Tarantino, John Waters, Nora Ephron-- Margy Rochlin has interviewed all these people. She's written big feature stories for all sorts of big magazines and newspapers.</p><p begin="00:50:10.56" data-timestamp="3010.56">But the very, very first big feature assignment that she was actually sent out on was by a publication in 1982, <i>The</i> <i>Los</i> <i>Angeles</i> <i>Reader.</i> They sent out a very nervous, very youthful Margy Rochlin to interview Moon Unit Zappa. Remember her? Daughter of Frank Zappa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Margy Rochlin</h4><p begin="00:50:29.11" data-timestamp="3029.11"> In this little bit that she does on the song, she's using a lot of this language that-- sort of Valspeak that no one had ever heard before. And it was considered really exotic. And so I was from the valley, so I was sent to go talk to her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:43.85" data-timestamp="3043.85"> She is one of your people.

And I felt like it was pretty important that at some point I better drain that coffee cup.</p><p begin="00:52:23.37" data-timestamp="3143.37">And so what happened was Moon told me a joke, and I didn't see the joke coming. And right before she told me the joke, I had taken a big swig of the coffee, which was now cold. And when she told me the joke, I burst out laughing, and I started to choke. And so I pressed my lips together, so I didn't spit it out. I didn't want to do a spit take.

And literally that's what happens here. The normal interview stops, and the social structure of the moment completely changes. The mom gives you the Heimlich maneuver, and then suddenly it stops feeling like an interview.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Margy Rochlin</h4><p begin="00:54:54.05" data-timestamp="3294.05"> Yeah. And I have to say that it was a very embarrassing experience, and it completely made me feel close to them. It was so interesting. When Moon's father died a while ago, I bumped into her somewhere, and we both burst into tears. I mean, I really felt like a little sister of mine had a loss. And the starting point was--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:17.24" data-timestamp="3317.24"> That moment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Margy Rochlin</h4><p begin="00:55:18.08" data-timestamp="3318.08"> That moment.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:18.80" data-timestamp="3318.8"> Yeah. To me, the thing about it that's useful is that it shows the useful purpose of a fiasco. That is, when social order breaks down, that can be a force not just for chaos, and for entropy, and for evil, but, in fact, that can be a force for good. It can bring people together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Margy Rochlin</h4><p begin="00:55:38.00" data-timestamp="3338"> Right. It was actually this huge success to me. I'd never been sent out under these kind of circumstances before. And I remember we beat the local paper. The <i>Herald</i> <i>Examiner</i> followed us a week later. So we had the first story, and it was sort of considered the definitive one because we had this glossary of terms that I had made her put together.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:01.39" data-timestamp="3361.39"> Of valley speak terms?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Margy Rochlin</h4><p begin="00:56:02.60" data-timestamp="3362.6"> Of valley speak terms.
