<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.31" data-timestamp="0.31">Hi, everybody. I'm speaking to you today from the stage of an opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City.</p><p begin="00:00:05.43" data-timestamp="5.43">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:00:06.68" data-timestamp="6.68"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:00:07.87" data-timestamp="7.87">A warning to listeners that there is mild cursing throughout this hour, and on the podcast, we're not going to beep that. And I'm here on an opera house stage with a story that is so small, it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this grand. It's actually about a real opera singer-- not a super-famous opera singer or anything like that. Carin Gilfry makes about half of her living singing. The other half she makes recording audio books.</p><p begin="00:00:31.86" data-timestamp="31.86">And about a year ago, she was staying at a hotel. And she had a deadline on this children's book that she was supposed to be recording, and the hotel room was kind of noisy. She was hearing a lot of noise from the street. And so she looked around for a quiet place, and she went into the closet-- put pillows all around to deaden the sound, sat on the floor with a microphone. And then the cord of the microphone went under the door of the closet out to her laptop, because her laptop had a fan that made noise.</p><p begin="00:00:58.30" data-timestamp="58.3">And so she closes the door so it's pitch dark except for the light from her iPad, which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read. And she began.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:01:07.75" data-timestamp="67.75"><i>The</i> <i>Exciting</i> <i>Exploits</i> <i>of</i> <i>an</i> <i>Effervescent</i> <i>Elf</i>, written by Trisha Sugarek and narrated by Carin Gilfry. Chapter one, "Where is Emma?" The enchanted forest was deep and green and splashed with--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:25.36" data-timestamp="85.36">Can I just say, wouldn't it be incredible if I just now played you the entire audiobook? You paid, like, $85 for those seats, right? Actually, I can't play you the whole audiobook because Carin gets exactly, like, two and a half sentences into this book. And she stumbles on a word, and she decides, oh wait, I'll just start again. I'll just start from the beginning.</p><p begin="00:01:46.13" data-timestamp="106.13">So she gets up to get out of the closet and start the tape again, start the recording again. And she tries to get out of the closet.</p><p begin="00:01:54.17" data-timestamp="114.17">[DOOR RATTLING]</p><p begin="00:01:55.56" data-timestamp="115.56"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:01:58.35" data-timestamp="118.35">Oh, [BLEEP].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.92" data-timestamp="119.92">And she discovers that she's locked in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:02:04.79" data-timestamp="124.79">[CHUCKLING]. Oh, my god. Seriously?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:13.25" data-timestamp="133.25">And Carin told me at first she thought, like, this isn't going to be that hard, right? After all, she has the iPad. There's Wi-Fi. She could call the front desk on Skype, right? But there was a problem.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:02:23.47" data-timestamp="143.47">This Wi-Fi was, like, half of one bar, and it kept just cutting out. But I found the hotel number.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:31.67" data-timestamp="151.67">This of course is on the recording.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:02:33.69" data-timestamp="153.69">212-661-9600.</p><p begin="00:02:38.63" data-timestamp="158.63">[IPAD ALERT NOISE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:02:39.51" data-timestamp="159.51">I dialed it.</p><p begin="00:02:41.55" data-timestamp="161.55">[PHONE RINGING]</p><p begin="00:02:43.16" data-timestamp="163.16"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Recording</h4><p begin="00:02:44.55" data-timestamp="164.55">Thank you for calling the Roosevelt Hotel. Please listen carefully to the following options. For additional information about the hotel, please visit our website--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:02:54.11" data-timestamp="174.11">And then, of course, it's, like, the longest hotel phone menu ever.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Recording</h4><p begin="00:02:58.82" data-timestamp="178.82">--for sales and catering services, press 3. For accounting, press 4. For the human resources office, press 5.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:03:09.28" data-timestamp="189.28">I'm trying to press 0 to get to the operator. And I'm thinking the Wi-Fi is going to cut out at any moment. So I'm listening to this giant long menu, and finally I hear--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Recording</h4><p begin="00:03:20.07" data-timestamp="200.07">If at any time, you wish to speak to an operator, press 8.</p><p begin="00:03:23.35" data-timestamp="203.35">[PHONE BUTTON]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:03:24.32" data-timestamp="204.32">So I press 8.</p><p begin="00:03:25.25" data-timestamp="205.25">[PHONE RINGING]</p><p begin="00:03:26.61" data-timestamp="206.61"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Front Desk</h4><p begin="00:03:28.40" data-timestamp="208.4">Reservations. May speaking. May I assist you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:03:30.87" data-timestamp="210.87">Hi, I'm actually in room 1136.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Front Desk</h4><p begin="00:03:33.05" data-timestamp="213.05">Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:03:33.84" data-timestamp="213.84">Can you hear me? Can you hear me?</p><p begin="00:03:36.50" data-timestamp="216.5">[CLICK]</p><p begin="00:03:37.27" data-timestamp="217.27"></p><p begin="00:03:38.06" data-timestamp="218.06">[BLEEP]</p><p begin="00:03:39.27" data-timestamp="219.27"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:44.59" data-timestamp="224.59">After that, there's seven minutes of silence on the recording-- just, like, total silence. Nothing happens except every now and then, Carin just laughs to herself. It happens one minute and 48 seconds after the phone call. Then it's quiet. There's no other sound for 44 seconds. And then on the recording, you hear--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:04:04.80" data-timestamp="244.8">[CHUCKLING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:07.84" data-timestamp="247.84">Now and then, she tries the door handle again, thinking, she told me later, this can't really be true. Like, this can't-- there's got to be a way this is going to work. One wall of the closet has the hallway on the other side. And 18 minutes after Carin locks herself in, she hears people. She hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall. And fortunately, she actually has the skills for this very situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:04:37.68" data-timestamp="277.68">[SPEAKING GERMAN] Can someone help me?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:54.97" data-timestamp="294.97">The Germans come to the door of the room. They whisper to each other for a little bit. And then, they do nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:05:04.42" data-timestamp="304.42">Hello?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:10.84" data-timestamp="310.84">Her husband is out on an audition-- he's also a singer-- and his phone was turned off. She texts her mom, hears nothing back. She phones her mom. And right then, somebody taps on the door of the hotel room and calls through it. "Are you OK?"</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:05:23.75" data-timestamp="323.75">Yes! Please, come in!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:26.03" data-timestamp="326.03">"Can you come to the door?" the person asks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:05:29.47" data-timestamp="329.47">I can't. I'm-- I'm stuck in the closet. [CHUCKLING]</p><p begin="00:05:34.23" data-timestamp="334.23"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Housekeeper</h4><p begin="00:05:35.18" data-timestamp="335.18">Hello? Where are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:05:37.08" data-timestamp="337.08">In the closet right here. Oh, thank you.

Oh--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:05:47.81" data-timestamp="347.81">Oh, my god.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:48.78" data-timestamp="348.78">Carin knows that's a really weird thing to say to somebody as you're getting rescued, but she just couldn't help herself. Nobody wants to look like a nut, you know? Apparently the Germans went and they found this very sweet Jamaican housekeeper.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:00.80" data-timestamp="1200.8">Which brings us to act one. Act One, "21 Chump Street, the Musical." I've always wondered what it would mean to try one of our radio stories as a musical. I was taken to so many musicals as a kid. And I think because of that, my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from musicals much more than from TV or movies.</p><p begin="00:20:23.39" data-timestamp="1223.39">If you think about, like, the classic old musicals-- <i>Fiddler</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>Roof</i> or even <i>A</i> <i>Chorus</i> <i>Line</i>-- it's like, they're funny at the beginning. And then there's something really emotional. And they're about some bigger idea. They take you into this world. I just love that.</p><p begin="00:20:37.79" data-timestamp="1237.79">And so what you're about to hear is our first attempt at a musical based on journalism. Probably 70% to 80% of what you're about to hear is verbatim quotes from interviews. The rest is artistic invention. I'll say that upfront.</p><p begin="00:20:51.29" data-timestamp="1251.29">It's based on a true story you may remember from our radio program. Back in May, 2011, at a bunch of high schools in Palm Beach County, Florida, a group of young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students. They went to classes. They ate in the cafeteria. They had fake Facebook accounts, of course.</p><p begin="00:21:08.18" data-timestamp="1268.18">There had been complaints about drugs being sold at these schools. That's what they were there to deal with. And what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway. Pretty much everybody involved in this, the cast, the chorus, the musicians, the director, Michael Mayer-- all from Broadway. Words and music are by Lin-Manuel Miranda, probably best known--</p><p begin="00:21:29.15" data-timestamp="1289.15">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:21:31.12" data-timestamp="1291.12"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:21:33.60" data-timestamp="1293.6">--probably best known for writing and starring in <i>In</i> <i>the</i> <i>Heights</i>.

Each week on our program, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today, from the stage of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York City, the radio drama episode.</p><p begin="00:38:08.81" data-timestamp="2288.81">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:38:11.29" data-timestamp="2291.29"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:38:12.79" data-timestamp="2292.79">We have journalism, memoir, true stories ed as radio drama. We have arrived at act two of our show. Act Two, "Of Mice and Men." So this next bit of radio drama is not an experiment for us like a musical or an opera. We thought it would be smart to have one story in today's show where we know what we're doing. A type of radio drama we actually bring you now and then on the program, a true story told on stage by the person that it actually happened to. Please welcome comedian Mike Birbiglia.</p><p begin="00:38:44.67" data-timestamp="2324.67">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:38:47.14" data-timestamp="2327.14"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:38:55.54" data-timestamp="2335.54">Wow. It's pretty easy following a musical.</p><p begin="00:39:11.51" data-timestamp="2351.51">I, uh-- I think that my favorite thing about being married is actually that you can share jokes with your wife or husband that are funny to you and that person and no one else other than maybe your cat. Because when you have a cat, your barometer for humor, poof, out the window.</p><p begin="00:39:38.93" data-timestamp="2378.93">Last summer, my wife and I went on a trip to Massachusetts. And I called it Cats-achusetts-- which is not funny, but in our house was the joke of the year. I was like, we're going to Cats-achusetts. My life is like, ahh! I was like, ahh! Our cat was like, ahh!</p><p begin="00:40:03.42" data-timestamp="2403.42">Everyone loves a good pun when you have a cat. And so we drive to Cats-achusetts. And when we arrive, my wife has a headache. And she asks me if I'll acclimate Ivan-- that's our cat-- to the bedroom, because you can't just put an indoor cat into a house, because he'll explode.</p><p begin="00:40:22.31" data-timestamp="2422.31">And so I bring him in the bedroom. But I'm so tired from the drive that I fall asleep, which is the only thing you cannot do when acclimating an indoor cat to a house. And so I wake up an hour later. Ivan is gone. He got out.</p><p begin="00:40:35.52" data-timestamp="2435.52">And so now I'm running around the house. I'm like, my cat's going to explode. I wake up my wife. I was like, Clo-- her name's Jen-- I say, Mr. Fantastic is gone-- his name's Ivan. And Clo gave me a look that I can only describe as "divorce eyes."</p><p begin="00:41:03.80" data-timestamp="2463.8">Because before that, point I was convinced that we would be married forever. And then once I saw the divorce eyes, I was like, oh, I guess this could end. And if it ended, it would look a lot like that.</p><p begin="00:41:16.97" data-timestamp="2476.97">And so now the two of us are running around the house. I'm like, my marriage is falling apart. My cat's going to explode. And we find Ivan, but we had another major problem in the house, which is that there were mice in the house.</p><p begin="00:41:37.94" data-timestamp="2497.94">It was actually worse than that, because they were parasitic mice. They have what's called toxoplasmosis, which means they have a-- yeah, you might know what this is. They have a parasite in them, and as a result they're unafraid of cats, and they're unafraid of people.</p><p begin="00:41:53.09" data-timestamp="2513.09">And the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching TV, and she looked next to her. And there was a mouse. And he was watching TV also. And she screamed!</p><p begin="00:42:11.55" data-timestamp="2531.55">And he just looked up at her like Stuart Little-- like, hey, what's going on? I don't like this show either. I don't know why all those women would want to marry that one guy.</p><p begin="00:42:29.01" data-timestamp="2549.01">And then she pushed him off the couch. And he didn't even run away. He didn't even scurry, which is a verb invented for mice. He just walked into the kitchen, like a roommate-- like, fine! I'll go in the other room! I just think you're overreacting.</p><p begin="00:42:50.39" data-timestamp="2570.39">And then he did a confessional into the Mouse Cam in the kitchen. He was like, I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win. I was here before they came. I'll be here when they're gone. I'm a mouse.</p><p begin="00:43:06.50" data-timestamp="2586.5">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:43:08.48" data-timestamp="2588.48"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:43:14.42" data-timestamp="2594.42">That's from "Real Mouse-wives of Cats-achusetts." That night, I'm sound asleep, and my wife wakes me up by grabbing my face. She says, Mo-- my name's Mike-- Mr. Fantastic found the mouse. You need to get the mouse.</p><p begin="00:43:41.59" data-timestamp="2621.59">And I sit up, and I say Clo, we have a cat. We do everything for the cat. We gave him food. We give him an apartment that he thinks is the world. We set aside an area in the apartment for him to poop in that we clean more often than the area where we poop.</p><p begin="00:44:12.95" data-timestamp="2652.95">We have a gentleman's agreement that in the unlikely event that a mouse should walk in that door (A LA MARLON BRANDO) that he will kill that mouse and we will never speak of that mouse again. And he will be protected. (NORMAL VOICE) That's from "Cat-father."</p><p begin="00:44:38.55" data-timestamp="2678.55">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:44:41.47" data-timestamp="2681.47"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:44:47.33" data-timestamp="2687.33">My wife says, Mo, get the mouse. And I sit up, and I see what may be the strangest tableau I will ever witness in my entire life. Ivan's smacking the mouse. The mouse flies in the air, lands, gets up, walks back towards Ivan.</p><p begin="00:45:07.38" data-timestamp="2707.38">Ivan smacks the mouse, flies in the air, lands, gets up, walks back towards Ivan. Ivan is thrilled! His toy is alive!</p><p begin="00:45:26.90" data-timestamp="2726.9">I have a serious sleepwalking disorder. So as I am watching this, I'm not even really sure it's happening. I'm thinking, I've had this dream before.</p><p begin="00:45:40.28" data-timestamp="2740.28">My wife says, Mo, get the mouse. And she hands me a cup.</p><p begin="00:45:50.19" data-timestamp="2750.19">I sit up. I walk towards the mouse. And the mouse walks towards me. I put the cup over the mouse. I put a magazine under the cup. I take the cup into the backyard, and I put the mouse into the forest, where I can only assume that he walked into the mouth of a wolf.</p><p begin="00:46:25.10" data-timestamp="2785.1">And from that day forward, we have called it Mouse-achusetts.</p><p begin="00:46:29.55" data-timestamp="2789.55">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:46:32.50" data-timestamp="2792.5"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:46:40.85" data-timestamp="2800.85">I want to point out something really special that happened there at the end.

<h3>Act Three: How Do You Slow This Thing Down</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:09.71" data-timestamp="2889.71">We have arrived at act three of our show. Act Three, "How do you Slow this Thing Down?"</p><p begin="00:48:16.35" data-timestamp="2896.35">So this story is a follow up to a story that we ran a couple of years ago, which was a full episode of our show about one of our contributors, Josh Bearman, and his family. The set-up is that Josh's parents got divorced when he was very young. And he and his brother Ethan grew up with their dad, who's a physicist, out in suburban Los Angeles.</p><p begin="00:48:35.11" data-timestamp="2915.11">Josh's mom and his half-brother David lived very differently. They drifted around. They ended up in Florida. They were barely keeping it together. Josh's mom was an alcoholic. David was an aspiring rapper getting acquainted with the court system</p><p begin="00:48:50.63" data-timestamp="2930.63">Together they lived in this tiny condo in a retirement community in West Palm Beach called Century Village, where they did not belong. They were not retirees. And they would get into various kinds of jams and crises. And Josh would have to fly to Florida to try to help. He ended up spending a lot of time there.</p><p begin="00:49:06.93" data-timestamp="2946.93">What you are about to hear is an experiment at creating a radio drama which has exactly the same structure as one of the documentary stories on our show. And so what's going to happen is the real Josh Bearman is going to narrate. And then instead of going to, like, quotes on tape or things like that, we have actors performing scenes that really happened. All of this really happened. In those scenes, Josh is played by Josh Hamilton. His brother David is played by James Ransone.</p><p begin="00:49:33.11" data-timestamp="2973.11">The story begins last year when real-life Josh found himself back in Florida with his two brothers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Bearman</h4><p begin="00:49:41.95" data-timestamp="2981.95">My mother's been in the hospital so much by now she's figured out how to direct the paramedics, like emergency chauffeurs or something, to all of the best facilities. Her room at Wellington Regional is big and bright. It's a corner room with big windows and a nice view. Although she can't see it, because right now she's connected to state-of-the-art equipment behind a curtain.</p><p begin="00:50:02.03" data-timestamp="3002.03">[SOUNDS OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT]</p><p begin="00:50:02.64" data-timestamp="3002.64">When I walk in, my brother David is there already.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:06.76" data-timestamp="3006.76">Hey, man.

And I went over to her house early on Christmas Eve, because they were having turkey dinner and everything-- you know, like a normal family.</p><p begin="00:50:47.48" data-timestamp="3047.48">I mean, I had to get out of Century Village. I was cooped up in there with Mom, and she was driving me crazy. So anyway, I'm at Tasha's. And Mom calls, and she sounds all drunk, right? And she's like, something happened to the car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:50:58.17" data-timestamp="3058.17">Something hap-- what kind of something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:59.98" data-timestamp="3059.98">I don't know!

And by the time I got back to the condo the next day, she was-- she was pretty deep in it. But it didn't seem like that big of a deal really. And then she woke up, and she was short of breath, so I was like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:28.25" data-timestamp="3088.25">Wait, wait, wait.
