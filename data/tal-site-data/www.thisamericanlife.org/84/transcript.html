<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.40" data-timestamp="0.4"> Before our story begins, let's remember how it used to be. Jacky lived in the South Side, in the black neighborhood. The city didn't enforce the housing code properly, didn't investigate arsons.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jacky Grimshaw</h4><p begin="00:00:10.02" data-timestamp="10.02"> There would be fires going on. It went on daily, several times a day. And it was just fire engines all the time. And so my daughter started to believe that when buildings got old and died, like people got old and died, that you knew a building was old and was dying because it would burn up.</p><p begin="00:00:30.31" data-timestamp="30.31"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:37.88" data-timestamp="37.88"> Before our story begins, Chicago was run by the Democratic machine. And black aldermen like Danny Davis would turn out the vote for the machine, election after election. But the machine didn't reward the black wards of those votes the way it paid back the white wards on the North Side, with street cleaning and sewers, with newly-paved roads and sidewalks, economic development money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danny Davis</h4><p begin="00:00:56.48" data-timestamp="56.48"> Well, actually, you know, we had called the areas colonies. I mean, and just basically picking up the garbage in these wards, just trying to keep them clean, was a real problem. The person who was elected, there would be so much focus on garbage pickup that, you know, you'd almost have to just be the garbage alderman. I mean, I recall telling people, time and time again, that I was tired of just being the garbage alderman.</p><p begin="00:01:31.73" data-timestamp="91.73"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:38.89" data-timestamp="98.89"> Before our story begins, the Chicago political machine squeezed black kids into mobile trailers behind public schools rather than let them attend white schools just blocks away. Before our story begins, the Chicago machine built high-rise public housing to hold blacks on the South Side and keep them from moving into white neighborhoods.</p><p begin="00:01:57.17" data-timestamp="117.17">Before our story begins, the Chicago political machine built a system of highways that coincidentally divided black neighborhoods from white, and particularly insulated the mayor's all-white neighborhood, Bridgeport. Typical inequities, unemployment in the white 11th Ward was 0%. Unemployment in the 4th Ward, where blacks lived, was 25%.</p><p begin="00:02:20.29" data-timestamp="140.29">This is a story about one ethnic group doing what so many other ethnic groups have done in this country, put its own candidate in City Hall, won the Mayor's office. But because this ethnic group happened to be black, what happened was unlike anything that happens when an Italian politician or an Irish politician or a Jewish politician takes City Hall.</p><p begin="00:02:38.44" data-timestamp="158.44">White voters deserted their own political party. White politicians tried to stage a public slow-motion coup. And the mayor faced pressures that were different from those faced by any white mayor of any city in America. The story happened in the 1980s in Chicago.</p><p begin="00:02:53.64" data-timestamp="173.64">Now, today it's hard to hear this story without thinking about what happened when another black politician took office a quarter century later, as president, how he faced pressures and opposition that were different from anything ever faced by a white president-- for starters, people saying he wasn't a citizen of the United States. There was a backlash. And a real part of it was about race.</p><p begin="00:03:14.41" data-timestamp="194.41">Back in the 1980s though, when race came up in Chicago, it wasn't signaled with code words and dog whistles. People didn't pretend things were not about race.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Radio Host</h4><p begin="00:03:23.46" data-timestamp="203.46"> Good evening, you're on with Harold Washington.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Caller </h4><p begin="00:03:25.38" data-timestamp="205.38"> Good evening. Mr. Washington, could you clear up a point for me? I understand that once you move into City Hall, you're going to remove all the elevator boxes and replace them with vines. Is that-- is that true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Radio Host</h4><p begin="00:03:40.82" data-timestamp="220.82"> What? Replace them with what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Caller </h4><p begin="00:03:43.38" data-timestamp="223.38"> With vines.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Washington</h4><p begin="00:03:44.34" data-timestamp="224.34"> Vines? V-I-N-E-S?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Radio Host</h4><p begin="00:03:51.15" data-timestamp="231.15"> You know what? I'm not even going to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Washington</h4><p begin="00:03:53.15" data-timestamp="233.15"> No, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Radio Host</h4><p begin="00:03:53.41" data-timestamp="233.41"> I'm not even going to ask you why. And--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Washington</h4><p begin="00:03:55.49" data-timestamp="235.49"> No, I don't think we have 3 million Tarzans in this city.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Radio Host</h4><p begin="00:03:58.86" data-timestamp="238.86"> Good evening. Randall is gone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:06.94" data-timestamp="246.94"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. This weekend marks the 30th anniversary of the death of Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington. He died early in his second term of office, back in 1987.</p><p begin="00:04:20.11" data-timestamp="260.11">Today we remember Harold's story with a show that we first put together in the early days of our radio show, for the 10th anniversary of his death. If you don't know anything about Harold Washington, you're in for a treat. He's this charismatic, idealistic man, funny and smart, and a great talker.</p><p begin="00:04:34.66" data-timestamp="274.66">A Democrat, framing issues with a skill that it's hard to think of any Democrat in office right now who does it as well. A pragmatist who got things done. Act One of our program today is about what happened during Harold's life. Then we have a short Act Two, about what came afterwards. Stay with us.</p><p begin="00:04:58.06" data-timestamp="298.06">A word about the voices you're going to be hearing over the course of this hour, it's mostly people who were close to Harold Washington; many of them activists and politicians. Lu Palmer, Judge Eugene Pincham, Congressman Danny Davis, then alderman Eugene Sawyer.</p><p begin="00:05:12.08" data-timestamp="312.08">There are people from his administration, Jacky Grimshaw, Grayson Mitchell, Timuel Black, and some reporters who followed his story-- Vernon Jarrett, Monroe Anderson, Gary Rivlin, Laura Washington, who later became his press secretary. There will also be an occasional opponent or voter. Stick around.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Yesterday</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:37.61" data-timestamp="337.61"> Act One, "Yesterday." For decades, Chicago politics had been run with an iron hand by the legendary political boss, Richard J. Daley. Our story begins just after his death, in 1976, when the machine was sputtering a bit with no strong leader, and the possibility, a small possibility, of change. To give you a sense of what it meant to be a loyal black aldermen in the Chicago machine at that time, consider what happened in city hall the day Richard Daley died.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vernon Jarett</h4><p begin="00:06:05.64" data-timestamp="365.64"> By tradition, the president pro temp of the city council should at least occupy the mayor's office until such time as a process was determined for the election of a new mayor.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:15.72" data-timestamp="375.72"> And who was the--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vernon Jarett</h4><p begin="00:06:16.80" data-timestamp="376.8"> That was Wilson Frost, a loyal black alderman from the 34th Ward, a Daley Democrat. A lawyer, impeccable reputation, impeccable credentials. The only mis-qualification he had was he was black.</p><p begin="00:06:37.05" data-timestamp="397.05">God ordained that he be born black.</p><p begin="00:06:39.63" data-timestamp="399.63">And the power structure sent police officers to the fifth floor armed, to sit at the door, to prevent Frost from even entering the mayor's office. That was a tremendous insult.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:55.63" data-timestamp="415.63"> It was an insult, but it was not unusual. The white machine picked who the black leaders would be. And mostly, those leaders did what they were told. Blacks in Chicago had nowhere to go but the Democratic machine. They were stuck.</p><p begin="00:07:08.08" data-timestamp="428.08">But then there were a series of famous and especially infuriating insults from the white political establishment. Biggest among them, black voters finally elected an anti-machine candidate named Jane Byrne who, once in office, betrayed them.</p><p begin="00:07:22.81" data-timestamp="442.81">Sucked up to the white machine, made appointments and decisions specifically to prove she was not in the pocket of black Chicago. Then, circumstances came together-- some by planning, some by luck-- that made it possible to elect a black mayor.</p><p begin="00:07:37.24" data-timestamp="457.24">The planning-- organizers registered over 100,000 minority voters, held rallies and meetings declaring it was time to elect a black mayor. The luck-- two white candidates split the white vote. One more piece of luck-- The Chicago Democratic Party had created, in spite of itself, Harold Washington. Vernon Jarrett was an old friend and a vocal newspaper columnist.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vernon Jarrett</h4><p begin="00:07:58.81" data-timestamp="478.81"> And Harold was in that party now. Don't forget. Harold had been a precinct captain.</p><p begin="00:08:04.33" data-timestamp="484.33">His father had groomed him as a precinct captain since he was-- what-- 11 years old. But his father was done wrong. So Harold is an unusual person in that he nursed this resentment of how the Democratic Party had deserted his father at one time, when his father ran for alderman of the 3rd Ward.</p><p begin="00:08:24.18" data-timestamp="504.18">He was a confused guy, got a little sense of mission in him, and wanting to do the right thing. But yet, he was balanced off by this pragmatism that you got to play ball, to a degree, with the organization. And he was correct. He wouldn't have made it without the Democratic machine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:42.28" data-timestamp="522.28"> Usually in Chicago, political activists had a choice. They could go with politicians who were good on the issues but then had no political experience dealing with the machine. Or they could get hacks, who knew the machine but were terrible on the issues.</p><p begin="00:08:54.40" data-timestamp="534.4">Washington was the rarest kind of politician-- delivered on the issues, knew the machine. Which was why, in fact, he did not want the job. Lu Palmer was at the center of the effort to draft a black mayor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lu Palmer</h4><p begin="00:09:04.81" data-timestamp="544.81"> Well, we talked to Harold.

It was also the political stance he felt most comfortable with by disposition.</p><p begin="00:31:38.21" data-timestamp="1898.21">And when black politicians or community activists came to city hall trying to get more for one neighborhood over another, he was so enormously popular in black Chicago-- where 85% of the black electorate turned out to vote for him, and where everyone simply referred to him as Harold-- that he could ignore the pressure.

The machine struck back. From the first day of Washington's first city council meeting, 29 aldermen-- all of them white, the old Democratic machine-- teamed up to oppose him. For the first time in memory, a Chicago mayor did not control City Hall. For the first time in memory-- clout-- that's what we call it in Chicago-- clout, sheer bullying force that was at the heart of Chicago politics, clout was no longer in the mayor's control.</p><p begin="00:33:31.44" data-timestamp="2011.44">It was the machine's 29 votes to Harold's 21 votes.

It came to be known locally as "Council Wars," after a local African-American comic named Aaron Freeman began staging moments in local politics as scenes from the <i>Star</i> <i>Wars</i> trilogy.

Black wards finally got the same street repair and garbage pickup as all the other wards. Jacky Grimshaw describes one scheme Washington came up with to do some improvements around the city, designed to be, of course, fairer than fair, to give every ward the same benefits.</p><p begin="00:36:29.09" data-timestamp="2189.09">But the 29, of course, opposed it. And Washington needed their approval because to pay for it, he wanted to issue a city bond.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jacky Grimshaw</h4><p begin="00:36:34.90" data-timestamp="2194.9"> So every ward was to get, I think, it was 10 miles of street resurfacing.

So he put all of the reporters on the bus. And he would go around to these various wards. We went out to Mount Greenwood, another area of the city that did not welcome blacks at the time, to say, your alderman is refusing to support this bond issue that I want to use to give you real streets.</p><p begin="00:37:11.98" data-timestamp="2231.98">And if you want it, you better tell your alderman to vote for it. And so by the time he got through doing this, you know, the folks in the communities are pretty much outraged. Black mayor or not, they wanted their streets. They wanted their sewers. They want their vaulted sidewalks repaired and so forth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:34.10" data-timestamp="2254.1"> What happens to American politics when one of the politicians happens to be black? In this case, what happened was that everything in city politics was seen through the prism of race even though often it had nothing to do with race. Often, it had more to do with reform. Gary Rivlin is the author very evenhanded history of Washington's years, <i>Fire</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>Prairie.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gary Rivlin</h4><p begin="00:37:50.64" data-timestamp="2270.64"> You know, everyone wants to understand Harold Washington as the first black mayor. And it's true, he was the first black mayor and that was a very significant thing. But he was also the mayor who beat the Chicago political machine.</p><p begin="00:38:02.89" data-timestamp="2282.89">He was the first reformer in 30 years to take on the machine. And he did it more successfully than anyone else before him, purely on a reform point of view. And so he was a different kind of politician. But no one could ever see beyond his race.</p><p begin="00:38:19.54" data-timestamp="2299.54">In fact, there was a political cartoon at the time I loved. And it was an editor asking a reporter covering the election, so anything changed? Anything new? And the reporter answered, no, he's still white, and he's still black. And really, it really wasn't that much more sophisticated than that cartoon indicated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Harold Washington</h4><p begin="00:38:43.29" data-timestamp="2323.29"> You pick up a local paper, and these guys just wax so eloquently.

The typical example-- some crime rates went up between 1985 and '86, even though overall crime was lower under Washington than under his white predecessor. But his opponents tried to make the case that this proved that the black mayor did not care about crime. Hate literature had said that he would do nothing about crime, because most crime is caused by blacks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gary Rivlin</h4><p begin="00:40:12.54" data-timestamp="2412.54"> So they were using this statistical bump between '85 and '86 to prove what the hate literature was saying, that the black mayor is going to be indifferent to crime. See, that's playing the race card, and playing it in a dirty way. It's a way of distorting statistics to play to racial fears out there.</p><p begin="00:40:37.05" data-timestamp="2437.05">So did Washington talk about race? Did he talk about the Chicago political machine always being biased against the black community? Sure. Is that playing the race card? Sure. But I also happen to think it's true, what he was saying.</p><p begin="00:40:50.61" data-timestamp="2450.61">Whereas what I think the opposition was doing much more of was playing the race card, and playing it in a dirty way, you know, trying to tweak and abuse statistics any way they could to prove their point and play into the worst fears of the white community. I never saw Washington playing into the worst fears of the black community. In fact, his rhetoric was, I'm going to be fairer than fair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:13.94" data-timestamp="2473.94"> Fact is, by the time he died, just a few months into his second term of office, Harold Washington had put together a working majority on the council. Not many more whites voted for him in his second election than in his first. But every political observer in Chicago says that he was making headway. Patrick O'Connor was one of the 29 aldermen who opposed Washington, that was one of the few swing votes who sometimes sided with the mayor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Patrick O'connor</h4><p begin="00:41:34.71" data-timestamp="2494.71"> We invited him up to a picnic in our ward. And he showed up at our picnic. And he got a great reception. People that really didn't vote for him, and probably wouldn't vote for him the next time, respected the fact that he came out there, that he wanted to say hello, that he wanted to participate. And bear in mind, that I was voting consistently with a block that was voting against him. And he came out, and we spent the day, and it was fine.</p><p begin="00:42:04.02" data-timestamp="2524.02">I remember one time we were both invited to a place that neither of us were particularly popular in the ward. And so I got a call from his office-- and this is, again, at a time when there was a council war going on-- asking was I going to this festival or whatever it was.</p><p begin="00:42:23.38" data-timestamp="2543.38">And if I was, would I meet the mayor on a corner in our ward and go in there together with him? And I told the guy, no, I'm not meeting him on the corner. I said, he wants me to go, he's got to pick me up at my house.</p><p begin="00:42:34.83" data-timestamp="2554.83">So the mayor pulls up to the front of my house. He comes in. We have-- a glass of wine, he had, and I had a beer. We sat around for a couple of minutes, and he met my family.</p><p begin="00:42:46.05" data-timestamp="2566.05">And he looks in my dining room. We didn't have any dining room furniture at the time. The kids were all young. And we just moved into the house. So he says, where's your dining room furniture? And my wife says, you don't pay him enough money.</p><p begin="00:42:59.54" data-timestamp="2579.54">And Harold goes, I knew this cheese was going to cost me something. I mean, and he was just that quick. He was really very, very good.</p><p begin="00:43:08.00" data-timestamp="2588">But my point is that we got in the car. We went to this festival. And by the time he left, he had people dancing with him. He went over. He was talking with folks. By the time he left, it might not have changed the mind of everybody in there that he was OK, but he had made a significant impact. And he understood by keeping that schedule and going to areas where he was not expected to show up or would traditionally not be the most welcome person, that he was winning percentages of people. And that's all he had to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:46.47" data-timestamp="2626.47"> Vernon Jarrett says that if Washington had lived, he would have done a lot to ease the strains of modern Chicago apartheid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vernon Jarrett</h4><p begin="00:43:52.93" data-timestamp="2632.93"> Harold was going to win over a big chunk of the white population. And I don't mean Gold Coast liberals. They were beginning to like this guy. And they could see something in him that represented them.</p><p begin="00:44:11.21" data-timestamp="2651.21">He was chubby, warm, friendly.

You'll see neighborhoods that still probably don't get their fair share of city services. But you'll see, I think, a dramatic difference in the attitude the public officials and policymakers have to equity in the city.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:27.00" data-timestamp="2727"> 30 years after Harold Washington's death, this is still mostly true. After Harold, one of the people elected mayor was Richard M. Daley, the son of Richard J. And even he was careful to have black press secretaries.</p><p begin="00:45:39.51" data-timestamp="2739.51">And he kept a number of appointees from the black administration before him. He issued bonds following the model of the Washington years, giving all of Chicago's wards equal benefits, something that was unheard of in the years before Washington. City services are still distributed more fairly, even today.</p><p begin="00:45:55.17" data-timestamp="2755.17">Though it's not perfect. People in black and latino neighborhoods across the city accuse the current mayor, Rahm Emanuel, of not listening to them on the biggest issues facing the city, schools and policing.

Because he was also a political advisor to Harold Washington, back during Harold's second run for Mayor.</p><p begin="00:48:12.57" data-timestamp="2892.57">10 years ago, when we rebroadcast the show, I reached Axelrod on his cell phone talk about that.

And one of the things that I looked at that night was how he did on the northwest side of Chicago.</p><p begin="00:48:41.67" data-timestamp="2921.67">You know, when Harold ran, he got 8% of the white vote in his first primary. I think he got 20% in the reelection. And much of the determined resistance was on the northwest side of Chicago.</p><p begin="00:48:55.77" data-timestamp="2935.77">And Obama carried all but one ward on the northwest side of Chicago. He even carried the precinct in which St. Pascal's Church sits. That was the church where Harold Washington and Walter Mondale campaigned in 1983 and met with really hostile resistance from the crowd. Obama carried that precinct. And I said to Barack that night, I think Harold's smiling down on us tonight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:22.32" data-timestamp="2962.32"> When Obama got to the general election for senator, he won 70% of the vote or more in every white ward in the city.

Well, back then, 10 years ago, when we last broadcast this show, we asked one of our colleagues at our home station, Chicago Public Radio, reporter Rob Wildeboar, to go find out.

We got nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:20.08" data-timestamp="3020.08"> But then, the same guy said that he wished that a black alderwoman, Toni Preckwinkle, would run for mayor. He'd vote for her, he said. She did a great job cleaning up Hyde Park.</p><p begin="00:50:29.99" data-timestamp="3029.99">Or there was a woman named Mary Kay, who lived in the 23rd Ward by Midway Airport, the neighborhood where Washington got the lowest vote total in the city in 1983-- less than 1%, just 199 votes. Mary Kay was not one of the 199. And she told our reporter, Rob, things are just different now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Kay</h4><p begin="00:50:47.50" data-timestamp="3047.5"> Back then, for me, it was white or black.</p><p begin="00:50:50.23" data-timestamp="3050.23">[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:50:51.10" data-timestamp="3051.1">You know? I was prejudice back then, probably, more so than I am now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rob Wildeboer</h4><p begin="00:50:56.67" data-timestamp="3056.67"> There's still some lingering around?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Kay</h4><p begin="00:50:58.93" data-timestamp="3058.93"> Oh, yeah.</p><p begin="00:50:59.68" data-timestamp="3059.68">[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:51:00.39" data-timestamp="3060.39">A little bit, you know? Don't turn my back on them, but yeah.</p><p begin="00:51:04.17" data-timestamp="3064.17">[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:51:05.83" data-timestamp="3065.83">No, I mean, that was 20 years ago. I don't have that fear these days. You know, now I accept you, black or white. You know? And Washington didn't do bad. I mean, he was a decent mayor. I would go for Obama as president. And he's black.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:29.82" data-timestamp="3089.82"> This interview obviously was before she got a chance to, back in 2007.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rob Wildeboer</h4><p begin="00:51:33.40" data-timestamp="3093.4"> So what's changed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Kay</h4><p begin="00:51:35.68" data-timestamp="3095.68"> Everything. I mean, I've changed. They've changed.</p><p begin="00:51:40.48" data-timestamp="3100.48">You know, the black people are more educated. They're, you know, they're standing on something these days. They've come a long way in this world.</p><p begin="00:51:49.15" data-timestamp="3109.15">And they deserve-- you know, they worked hard. I mean, you see it in the stores. You know? They're doing just as good as us. They're well-dressed. They're clean. They're not the ghetto. They've come out of the ghetto. And you know, they want what we got. What we've always had. You know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rob Wildeboer</h4><p begin="00:52:10.93" data-timestamp="3130.93"> And so what's your take on that? Is that good or bad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mary Kay</h4><p begin="00:52:14.61" data-timestamp="3134.61"> That's good. As long as they're-- anybody that's willing to work for what they get, they deserve today. They deserve it. You know what I mean? If you want it and you go for it and you're willing to work, then, you know, you deserve what you got.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:35.46" data-timestamp="3155.46"> When I asked the people who urged Howard Washington to run in the first place-- that's Lu Palmer and Timuel Black-- what the lessons of the Washington years are, they both said the same thing. They talked about how it was a mistake to think you could make the world change if you pinned your hopes on just one man. After Harold died, the movement died, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lu Palmer</h4><p begin="00:52:54.03" data-timestamp="3174.03"> And I'll tell you, a lot people don't like to criticize Harold Washington. I blame Harold for this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Timuel Black</h4><p begin="00:53:01.06" data-timestamp="3181.06"> What should have been happening, we should have anticipated either his demise or removal from office, and been organizing for that possibility.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lu Palmer</h4><p begin="00:53:12.71" data-timestamp="3192.71"> Harold was put on a pedestal. And I think that was a major mistake. We lifted him to almost-god status.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:24.47" data-timestamp="3204.47"> Barack Obama noticed the same problem. In fact, there's a passage in <i>Dreams</i> <i>From</i> <i>my</i> <i>Father</i> about this, when he writes about what Chicago was like immediately after Harold's death.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barack Obama</h4><p begin="00:53:33.18" data-timestamp="3213.18"> The day before Thanksgiving, Harold Washington died.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:36.39" data-timestamp="3216.39"> This is Obama, reading on the audio book.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barack Obama</h4><p begin="00:53:38.43" data-timestamp="3218.43"> It occurred without warning-- sudden, simple, final, almost ridiculous in its ordinariness, the heart of an overweight man giving way. It rained that weekend, cold and steady. Indoors and outside, people cried.</p><p begin="00:53:56.87" data-timestamp="3236.87">By the time of the funeral, Washington loyalists had worked through the initial shock. They began to meet, regroup, trying to decide on a strategy for maintaining control, trying to select Harold's rightful heir.</p><p begin="00:54:09.65" data-timestamp="3249.65">But it was too late for that. There was no political organization in place, no clearly-defined principles to follow. The entire of black politics had centered on one man, who radiated like the sun. Now that he was gone, no one could agree on what that presence had meant.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:26.17" data-timestamp="3266.17"> What's interesting, of course, is that this is what so many Democrats are saying this year, now that Barack Obama is out of office and Donald Trump is in power, and the Democratic Party is at one of its lowest ebbs in memory.</p><p begin="00:54:40.86" data-timestamp="3280.86">I checked in with Obama and Washington's campaign advisor, David Axelrod, this week. He told me Harold might have been surprised by the fact that a black man was elected president just two decades after Harold won his second term. But he would not have been surprised at the backlash once that black man got to the Oval Office.</p><p begin="00:55:09.84" data-timestamp="3309.84">Well, today's program was originally produced back in 1997, by Alex Blumberg and myself, Nancy Updike, Alix Spiegel, and Julie Snyder. Senior editor for this show was Paul Tough.</p><p begin="00:55:18.56" data-timestamp="3318.56">Production help from Rachel Howard, Seth Lind, Bruce Wallace, BA Parker, and Matt Tierney. Since we first put this show on the air 20 years ago, four of our interviewees-- Lu Palmer, Vernon Jarrett, Eugene Sawyer, and Judge Eugene Pincham-- have died. I'm sad to say that none of them lived to see a black man win the Oval Office.</p><p begin="00:55:36.26" data-timestamp="3336.26">We used archival footage from the following sources, from Brian Boyer's film, <i>Harold</i> <i>Washington</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>Council</i> <i>Wars,</i> from Bill Cameron's taped recordings of Harold Washington's speeches and press conferences. We got tape from Chicago's Museum of Broadcast Communications. Thanks to Bruce DuMont and the staff there.</p><p begin="00:55:51.73" data-timestamp="3351.73">Also, from Howard Gladstone and Jim Ylisela's film, <i>The</i> <i>Race</i> <i>for</i> <i>Mayor.</i> From Bill Stamets's film, <i>Chicago</i> <i>Politics--</i> A <i>Theater</i> <i>of</i> <i>Power,</i> and from WBBM's archival news footage. WXYT Radio gave us an archival tape of Aaron Freeman's <i>Council</i> <i>Wars</i> satire. And WTTW-TV gave us archival footage of the '83 debates. In addition to all that, we would like to think Eva Baeza, who at the time was director of the Chernin Center for the Arts at the Duncan YMCA.</p><p begin="00:56:16.87" data-timestamp="3376.87">And thanks to Gary Rivlin, who gave us advice throughout this production. We recommend his book, <i>Fire</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>Prairie.</i> It's a great history of the Washington years.</p><p begin="00:56:25.47" data-timestamp="3385.47">Thanks to Hugo Tyrel and Dolores Woods. Our website, thisamericanlife.org. <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> is delivered to public radio stations by PRX, the Public Radio Exchange. Thanks, as always, to the co-founder of our program, Mr. Torey Malatia.
