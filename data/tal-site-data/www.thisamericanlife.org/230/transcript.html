<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.26" data-timestamp="0.26">I don't know if you've seen this guy Hamid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan, on TV, heard him on the radio, but that is one charming man.</p><p begin="00:00:08.20" data-timestamp="8.2">A year ago this week, in January 2002-- not long after the Taliban were driven from power in Afghanistan-- he came to the United States, partly to be on hand for the State of the Union address last year. And while he was here, he spoke with an audience that was mostly Afghan-Americans at Georgetown University. And he said to them, in Pashto and then in English, come back. Come back to Afghanistan. He directed this especially to the young people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamid Karzai</h4><p begin="00:00:33.50" data-timestamp="33.5">Work hard. Learn well. Study well, and make money. Bring it to Afghanistan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.56" data-timestamp="41.56">He grinned at the audience. Then read from this card that had been handed to him with a question on it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hamid Karzai</h4><p begin="00:00:46.75" data-timestamp="46.75">OK, specifically, how would you suggest the younger generation of Afghans living in US-- OK. Specifically, your areas in which you have studied. Those of you who have gone through university and have acquired degrees in various fields-- medicine, engineering, computers, management, banking, business administration, all that. These are the areas-- statistics, by the way. We need that very much. Accounting, auditing. So do come.</p><p begin="00:01:18.34" data-timestamp="78.34">In addition to that, if somebody wants to be the president, she or he is also welcome. So all are welcome.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:30.03" data-timestamp="90.03">Afghanistan had been at work for 22 years. There were the Soviets, then the ten-year fight to expel them. Then the war between the Afghans. Then the Taliban took over.</p><p begin="00:01:39.59" data-timestamp="99.59">As a result, an entire generation of Afghans has grown up in the United States. Teenagers today who are much more American than they are Afghan. Many of them have never seen their country.</p><p begin="00:01:49.65" data-timestamp="109.65">And it's possible that the very first teenager to take Hamid Karzai's invitation to heart and return to Afghanistan was a 17-year-old from Northern California named Hyder Akbar. And, as luck would have it, before he went, he met a radio producer named Susan Burton, and she urged him to take a tape recorder along on the trip.</p><p begin="00:02:09.45" data-timestamp="129.45">Well, today we feel lucky to bring you the recordings that he made. As you'll hear, Hyder's father had moved back to Afghanistan-- months before Hyder went-- to work for Hamid Karzai in the new government of the country. And because of his father's position, which was pretty high up in the government, Hyder gets an insider's look at everything going on in the country. It is a very unusual glimpse at a country that most of us still do not really have much sense of.</p><p begin="00:02:34.21" data-timestamp="154.21">Of course, this is <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> from WBEZ Chicago, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:02:41.40" data-timestamp="161.4">For most of our show today, you're going to be hearing the recordings that Hyder made himself. But to give you a sense of who Hyder was before he went on his trip to Afghanistan, Susan Burton begins Hyder's story before the trip at his home in Concord, California.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Teenage Embed, Part One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:02:57.42" data-timestamp="177.42">When Hyder goes to Barnes and Noble, the first thing he does with any new book they have in about Afghanistan is turn to the index and look up Kabul Radio. It's pretty much always in there, because on the night in 1979 when the Soviets took Kabul, they stormed two places. One was the palace and the other was Kabul Radio. Kabul Radio was headed by Hyder's dad.</p><p begin="00:03:18.52" data-timestamp="198.52">During the years of the resistance, Hyder's dad had two close friends. One was Hamid Karzai, now the President of Afghanistan, and the other was a legendary commander named Abdul Haq. After he looks up Kabul Radio, the next thing Hyder looks up in any book is always Abdul Haq. In his favorite book, <i>Soldiers</i> <i>of</i> <i>God</i> by Robert D. Kaplan, there's an entire chapter, chapter five, completely and totally devoted to Abdul Haq. One time Hyder told his mother what Kaplan said about Abdul Haq's headquarters in Peshawar.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:03:47.14" data-timestamp="227.14">And then he describes how he went into his office, and how he was always busy, and he had one hand on the phone, another one looking at some maps. And you always felt like you were wasting time when you were [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. And my mom was like, wait. He wasn't that busy. He was at our house every single day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:04:14.41" data-timestamp="254.41">Hyder's dad worked with the resistance. For years, Hyder didn't see his dad and didn't know his hero, Abdul Haq. When Abdul Haq suddenly showed up at the family's house in California a couple weeks before September 11, Hyder was speechless. That day, Abdul Haq told Hyder's dad that he was scheming to topple the Taliban. Not long after September 11, he got in touch again. He was going in. He was ready.</p><p begin="00:04:49.22" data-timestamp="289.22">Days after Abdul Haq snuck into Afghanistan, Hyder came home from school and found his mother crying in her bedroom. Abdul Haq had been captured and killed by the Taliban, shot with dozens of bullets, then hung from a tree. Hyder wrote about the execution in his current events journal at school the next day, and a teacher wrote a check mark, and then, in red ballpoint pen, "Sorry."</p><p begin="00:05:11.81" data-timestamp="311.81">Just weeks after Abdul Haq's death, the Taliban were defeated by the American forces. The next month, Hyder's dad had a long talk with his old friend Hamid Karzai, sold his business, and left for Afghanistan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:05:30.21" data-timestamp="330.21">OK. This is my room. To the right is the TV, and I have a couple of video games and stuff like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:05:35.78" data-timestamp="335.78">When I first meet Hyder, he shows me around his house. We sit down in the living room and look at family photos, like a snapshot of Hamid Karzai at Disneyland maybe 20 years ago, baby-faced, standing next to Goofy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:05:47.75" data-timestamp="347.75">Well, this is an issue, September 1968, it's a National Geographic issue.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:05:53.68" data-timestamp="353.68">Hyder opens the old magazine, which he bid for off of Ebay, and shows me a favorite picture of Afghanistan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:05:58.69" data-timestamp="358.69">Actually, I really, really, really like this picture. This is more of the countryside of Afghanistan. And it's green, green grass and trees, and then there's just like blue, blue water flowing through. Yeah. There's a shepherd here, and then there's a cow but I'm sure. That house looks pretty neat, too. In the middle of the river, there's a rock, and there's a house built on top of it. I don't know how he gets back to the land, But I think he would probably goes through these rocks or something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:06:26.03" data-timestamp="386.03">We look at the picture for so long that it starts to seem to me almost like a fairytale picture you can enter inside. Like when the movie camera goes in for a closeup on a color plate in a storybook, and then all of a sudden, the wagons are rolling and the animals' tails are swishing in Dolby stereo, and the action is actually happening right there.</p><p begin="00:06:53.15" data-timestamp="413.15">Before Hyder's dad left for Afghanistan, he owned a hip hop clothes store in Oakland. A few months ago, he was selling FUBU pants to teenagers. Now he spends his days with the people running Afghanistan.</p><p begin="00:07:05.23" data-timestamp="425.23">Hyder shows me a picture taken just a couple weeks before of his dad sitting near Karzai at a medieval-looking dining table in the palace in Kabul at a meeting about peacekeeping troops.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:07:14.45" data-timestamp="434.45">When I see this, I'm really, really happy for him. Because it's kind of like his dream. I could tell how bored and how frustrated he was living here, and having to just be at the store and just live everyday life. I remember for a couple years, my mom was telling him, don't even interact with people. I think it's pretty much because he had lost hope. It was weird.</p><p begin="00:07:36.18" data-timestamp="456.18">I mean, a lot of people have been effected by September 11, but like, our family's literally turned upside down. Even me. My whole plan of my life has changed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:07:47.47" data-timestamp="467.47">Before September 11, Hyder thought he'd study business, maybe become a mortgage broker, like his older brother. But after, Hyder felt like he had found his mission in life. He would do something big to help Afghanistan rebuild, like become a politician or an engineer.</p><p begin="00:08:02.37" data-timestamp="482.37">The one problem was, all of his dreams took place in a country to which he'd never been. So he convinced his dad to let him join up with him in Afghanistan for the summer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:08:10.37" data-timestamp="490.37">Like, I read a lot about it, and I learn a lot. By now I know a lot about it. But I've never visited it. So that's another reason I really want to go. Because it's easy to talk, but then to actually do it is much harder, you know? That's what my father was telling me, too. Right now it's easy to talk about going back, but once you have to, like, take a glass of water, cold water, and put it over your head, and that's how you take the shower, and on mountains, and you have like a biscuit in your hand, it's not as easy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:08:38.65" data-timestamp="518.65">When your dad said that to you, was that kind of sobering?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:08:41.65" data-timestamp="521.65">No, it actually made me more hard-headed, and even want to go back even more, you know? Just to prove it, and just to get the doubts out of my head. It's almost like a test, you know? I want to pass it. It's almost like a test on how much I can take.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher</h4><p begin="00:09:01.15" data-timestamp="541.15">OK, on the test, or quiz, I should say--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:09:04.76" data-timestamp="544.76">There are a lot of Afghan kids at Hyder's high school, but he tries not to talk too much about his trip with them, or with anyone.

If I wasn't so fortunate, I could have easily been growing up there right now. Growing up in a generation that literally doesn't know anything but war.

Before leaving for Afghanistan, his dad made a deal with him. If he wanted him to buy him a ticket, he had to lose weight. Hyder started running on a treadmill in his garage wearing a sweatshirt, plus another shirt, plus a garbage bag, to help him sweat more.

And I actually don't want to take them. Because I don't know, it kind of adds on more to the foreigner, an American, going to Afghanistan. It might seem silly or childish or too much testosterone or whatever, but I just don't want to go in and get shots to make sure I don't get sick or malaria or anything. Because my father never had to. I'm kind of like, it's my own country. I'm just going to go in there. I don't want them to think of me as a foreigner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:12:23.01" data-timestamp="743.01">Hyder's trip is just six weeks away. He's hoping that instead of flying straight to Kabul, he can arrange to travel over the Khyber pass. That's the right way to do it, he says. That's the way everyone's done it. The Mongols, the British conquerors, the mujahideen. He's planning what to pack-- traditional Afghan clothes, his books about Afghanistan, and batteries so that he can listen to his U2 CDs. He picks up the remote control for his stereo.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:12:47.84" data-timestamp="767.84">You know, that's a pretty famous U2 song.

And it's kind of like, when I picture that place, "Where the Streets Have No Name," I picture something like Afghanistan, you know? And I think it's a song, it's pretty much tired about how set and systematic the world is. Yeah. Like, "I want to run, I want to hide, I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside." So it's kind of like at the point where I am right now.

This is my last day here.</p><p begin="00:14:16.15" data-timestamp="856.15">I was listening to the radio the other day, and they had a funny commercial. They're promoting some contest to go to a trip anywhere. and they were naming all these countries. Italy, France. And then they're like, Afghanistan. And then they started like, ha, they make like this funny music. And they're like, OK. Well, maybe not Afghanistan. And it just hit me as weird since I'm going there today. I'm going today.</p><p begin="00:14:42.40" data-timestamp="882.4">I just got done speaking to my dad about 15 minutes ago, and he confirmed that somebody's going to come and pick me up in Peshawar. I'll probably spend the night at a relative's house over there. And from there I'm going to drive to Kabul, which is like a six hour drive from Peshawar. Then he told me to shave my goatee. So I'll go ahead and shave that.</p><p begin="00:15:06.43" data-timestamp="906.43">That's about it. I'm just really, really excited. I just feel like going, "ahhhh!" I'm just really, really, really, really, really, really, really excited. Signing off from San Francisco. Next recording you'll hear will probably be from Peshawar. Goodbye.</p><p begin="00:15:37.84" data-timestamp="937.84">Hello, hello? I'm actually on my way to Torkham right now, the border station between Afghanistan and Pakistan. I arrived at the house in Peshawar. I knew I had arrived when I saw an AK-47 in the living room, just lying up against the cabinet. Fully loaded and ready to go.</p><p begin="00:16:06.07" data-timestamp="966.07">I got stopped by police and got checked and everything. Because they saw the microphone. But I turned it on really quick.</p><p begin="00:16:14.96" data-timestamp="974.96">We're at the Kyber Pass right now, and it's pretty incredible. There's two mountains down there. It's right between mountain ridges. I don't want to attract unwanted attention, but I am passing through the Khyber Pass right now. This is the Khyber Pass.</p><p begin="00:16:33.95" data-timestamp="993.95">So I was going through the Khyber Pass. And we reached Torkham, finally. I didn't really have that sense of wow, this is my country, you know? I'm finally in Afganistan. None of that kiss the ground stuff. You know, I just saw a lot of poor kids running around, a lot of burkas, beards. I felt like a total outsider.</p><p begin="00:17:00.77" data-timestamp="1020.77">My dad kept on telling me, the road to Kabul is horrible. It's really bad. It's really bad. It's really been destroyed.</p><p begin="00:17:08.08" data-timestamp="1028.08">So I'm thinking, fine. A bad road. Potholes here and there. A lot. Probably have to slow down, go around them, et cetera.</p><p begin="00:17:17.03" data-timestamp="1037.03">No. I mean, he said road. This is the key was there. So I was thinking there would be a road there. What he should have said is from Jalalabad to Kabul, there's no road. I think my head probably hit the top of the car about like 30 times through the whole ride. And towards the end of the trip, I was starting to get motion sickness, and I was feeling like I was going to throw up, and I was getting really sick and dizzy. This whole place is so barren and so--</p><p begin="00:17:49.24" data-timestamp="1069.24">To tell you the truth, I kind of had regret for what I had done. I was like, wow. You know, maybe I wasn't ready for this.</p><p begin="00:18:06.60" data-timestamp="1086.6">I'm at the doorway of the Kabul Hotel right now. We're actually invited somewhere for lunch. We're going to go there right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Said Fazal Akbar</h4><p begin="00:18:13.20" data-timestamp="1093.2">[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:18:14.34" data-timestamp="1094.34">That's my dad. All right.</p><p begin="00:18:18.15" data-timestamp="1098.15">The hotel, Kabul Hotel. Let me describe the hotel to you. Me and my dad, we're in same room. It's a pretty small room. There's two beds, a little, like, area where you can sit, balcony where probably like three people could stand.</p><p begin="00:18:32.79" data-timestamp="1112.79">There's actually a huge place where a missile had hit Kabul Hotel, and it's still like that, you know? There's like this huge hole, all, like, four stories, on one side. And this is probably one of the nicest hotels here.</p><p begin="00:18:51.45" data-timestamp="1131.45">Hello, hello? I think it's my fourth day in Kabul. Anyway, I was just coming out of the bathroom after I cleaned myself for evening prayers, and I just heard a couple of rockets outside. I ran to the balcony real quick just to see what was going on. And everybody-- except for like a few people who jumped up, just trying to see where it was coming from-- the rest of the city was functioning pretty normal. It was pretty weird.</p><p begin="00:19:18.85" data-timestamp="1158.85">Let me ask my dad if he saw that too, that the whole city was pretty normal. My dad, I think, listened to the news.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:19:24.95" data-timestamp="1164.95">[SPEAKING PASHTO]?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Said Fazal Akbar</h4><p begin="00:19:33.58" data-timestamp="1173.58">[SPEAKING PASHTO]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:19:36.38" data-timestamp="1176.38">[SPEAKING PASHTO]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Said Fazal Akbar</h4><p begin="00:19:38.03" data-timestamp="1178.03">[SPEAKING PASHTO]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:19:42.79" data-timestamp="1182.79">Yeah, my dad said the same thing. He said that everybody's just going about their own business. That's basically what he just said in Pashto. I've seen plenty of rockets here in Kabul.</p><p begin="00:19:53.96" data-timestamp="1193.96">I'm going to go do my evening prayers. Go downstairs.</p><p begin="00:19:59.81" data-timestamp="1199.81">Today was a really interesting day. I went to the palace today, and there was this incredible, like-- it was almost like going through a movie. Like this old, the gates and how they open, and the huge locks. It almost looked like you're visiting someplace in Disneyland or Universal Studios. But it was the real thing.</p><p begin="00:20:18.01" data-timestamp="1218.01">All of a sudden Karzai comes out, sees my dad, and he says hello. And my dad introduces me to him, he's like, this is my son. I got kind of nervous, actually. You know? It's hard not to be, meeting him. You know, that queasy feeling in your stomach. Felt my, you know, like, heart rate go up.</p><p begin="00:20:36.65" data-timestamp="1236.65">And he walks so fast. He's so busy right now. It's just there's like four days to the [SPEAKING PASHTO]. He doesn't even walk. He practically runs.</p><p begin="00:20:45.47" data-timestamp="1245.47">After that, somebody else was just entering the palace, and it was Rashid Dostum, probably the most infamous warlord. He's uh, pretty out there even by Afghan standards. I've heard stories about this guy rolling over people with tanks. Strapping people down to tanks and, like, crushing them. So it was weird to shake hands with that kind of a fellow.</p><p begin="00:21:10.89" data-timestamp="1270.89">It's just really interesting, just being in the palace at a time like this, you know? This is the future of the country, right here. You have, like, infamous warlords walking this way and famous ministers walking that way. It's pretty exciting. I mean, it's like equivalent, I think, of Lollapalooza or something. Going backstage and getting to meet all of these rock stars going back and forth. It was kind of like that. As nerdy and dorky as that sounds, that's pretty much how it was like for me.</p><p begin="00:21:43.33" data-timestamp="1303.33">So my dad has been appointed the governor of Kunar, but he really can't go there yet. There's still some resistance. In the morning, there's usually a lot of people from Kunar that come over to see my dad. 5:30 in the morning, completely dark outside, 30 people from Kunar are already lined up at the door.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:03.87" data-timestamp="1323.87">[SPEAKING PASHTO]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:22:09.92" data-timestamp="1329.92">One time they left and my dad, he sat down and he actually told me almost everything that's been going on. And there's a lot going on and there's so many-- Politics is really dirty. That's all I can say. There's so much going on. There's so much against my dad, so much for my dad, so much up to my dad. It's really a big deal, you know, to trust me with all that. He warned me, too. Like, in this documentary, or when talking to other people, not to say anything. I can't even tell my mom on the phone about it, because you know how phones are listened.</p><p begin="00:22:41.18" data-timestamp="1361.18">And when he said that to me, it really made me feel like his son. I'm always there. Right by his side. And like, all these tribal elders he meets, all these people he talks to like the most intimate stuff, and I'm just standing with him every second, you know, like this major commander, North Americans, and everything. And it's really amazing, I mean, how much he trusts me with everything. I've got to be careful and not ruin it.</p><p begin="00:23:18.19" data-timestamp="1398.19">I'm traveling to Parwan right now. God, this road is horrible.</p><p begin="00:23:24.23" data-timestamp="1404.23">Parwan was a really interesting place. It was a sort of this vacation place for Afghans living in Kabul when it got a little hot. There was actually a lot of people there. A lot of people there. It was really packed.</p><p begin="00:23:37.85" data-timestamp="1417.85">It's almost a sign of things getting back to normal again. Like, people being able to visit Parwan again. Because ever since the jihad and the resistance, it was a key area of fighting. And it's really interesting to see all these people coming back after so many years.</p><p begin="00:23:53.85" data-timestamp="1433.85">[MUSIC WITH DRUMS]</p><p begin="00:23:57.56" data-timestamp="1437.56">The Taliban had banned music for six years. And I think it's only been like five or six months since music has come back. So it's also really new.</p><p begin="00:24:12.03" data-timestamp="1452.03">And then at this one point, there was actually these men started dancing, and all these people gathered around and they were all watching and clapping. And all of a sudden, some chump with a Kalashnikov came over, and he stopped the drummers and he stopped the dancing. He was like, what are you doing, blah blah blah, not Islamic, et cetera. It wasn't even, you know, like girls and boys dancing, or anything like that. That would be unthinkable. It was just a guy dancing.</p><p begin="00:24:40.99" data-timestamp="1480.99">And then later on, all of a sudden I see this huge mob running. And a Sikh was in front, and they were like dragging him forward with a Kalashnikov. A Sikh-- you know who Sikh are. They're the ones with the turbans and the beard. My dad was like, what's going on? They're like, oh. We caught him drinking alcohol. And I don't know what they were going to do to him. But whatever it was, it kind of put a damper on the whole thing.</p><p begin="00:25:19.42" data-timestamp="1519.42">I am in my hotel room. It's around 9:30 AM. And my uncle came in. He's bought dye for his beard. He's laughing right now. He knows a little bit of English, and he figured out I was talking about him.</p><p begin="00:25:35.57" data-timestamp="1535.57">He has this coloring device in his hand. "Prime Cream Hair Color With Conditioner, 45 Black." And there's this lady with like wavy hair and a smiling face. A couple of white hairs growing, so he's going to get young again.</p><p begin="00:25:52.93" data-timestamp="1552.93">And it's really funny, because he's this like big, macho commander. Probably the biggest commander in the Kunar Province area, which is a major fighting area. He's lost an eye, you know? Always walking around with an AK. He went to the bathroom to go and color his beard.</p><p begin="00:26:14.89" data-timestamp="1574.89">Yesterday he was showing me all these parts in his body that metal just left, you know, his arms-- "touch this, touch this." And I was touching it, and there's metal there, and there's metal in his head, and forehead, and upper arm, and elbow-- just, you know, shrapnel and bullet wounds, et cetera.</p><p begin="00:26:34.91" data-timestamp="1594.91">He came out right now. He's closing the lid or something. I think he's working on it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:26:39.38" data-timestamp="1599.38">[SPEAKING PASHTO]?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hyder's Uncle</h4><p begin="00:26:40.37" data-timestamp="1600.37">[SPEAKING PASHTO].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:26:43.41" data-timestamp="1603.41">He colors his beard.</p><p begin="00:26:50.02" data-timestamp="1610.02">Testing, one, two, three.

It's about nine o'clock at night.</p><p begin="00:27:01.35" data-timestamp="1621.35">Today Haji Abdul Qadir, the vice president of Afghanistan, was assassinated. And he was Abdul Haq's brother, and Abdul Haq was my dad's best friend.</p><p begin="00:27:20.54" data-timestamp="1640.54">We were actually taken to see-- me and my dad-- my dad took me with him. He was taken to go see the body. They had put him in a coffin and everything, and it was a-- I don't know what you call the room. I mean, is it, like, the frozen-- I mean, kind of like the cold room where they keep bodies, I guess.</p><p begin="00:27:38.30" data-timestamp="1658.3">And to be honest with you, I have never really seen a dead body like that. And my dad-- I mean, this is the first time I realized how going through a war must change you. Because he totally just jumped at the body, I mean, as if he was alive, and he just grabbed the towel that was on him, and you could see-- it almost like scratched his face. There were scratch marks on his face.</p><p begin="00:28:04.35" data-timestamp="1684.35">My dad actually touched his face and was like, oh, I see. There's f here, and here. I mean, totally cool. And my dad asked if he was shot in the face. And they were like, no, he wasn't shot in the face. He was shot in the heart. And my dad was like, OK. He just casually unwrapped the towel a little more, and there was a bullet wound there. My dad touched that, too, and he was like oh, OK. And he said a little prayer and we left the room.</p><p begin="00:28:33.01" data-timestamp="1713.01">It was happening way too quick to sink in. I think I'll age about five years in these three months.</p><p begin="00:28:51.71" data-timestamp="1731.71">So I was up pretty late this morning. 7:30, 8 o'clock. I had a hard time sleeping last night again. Knowing, you know, my dad could be assassinated just like Haji Qadir.</p><p begin="00:29:08.52" data-timestamp="1748.52">I mean, there are-- our driver Sotor-- somebody had come, I think, who was sent from the opposition. He started asking our driver questions like, so how many people who are with them at night, sleeping? Me and my dad. Do you guys have any Kaloshnikovs, AKs, guns?</p><p begin="00:29:29.52" data-timestamp="1769.52">I don't know. A lot of times, just like driving in the car, the whole scene plays out in my mind.

Hyder Akbar took a tape recorder to make an audio diary of his time in Kabul. His father had moved back to Afghanistan a few months before him, back when the Taliban fell, to work in the new Afghan government.</p><p begin="00:31:24.31" data-timestamp="1884.31">Up until this point in our story, his father was officially the governor of Kunar Province. But then, the day the vice president was assassinated, July 5, Hyder's father got a new job. He became the official spokesman for the entire Afghan government. Hyder became his unofficial assistant.</p><p begin="00:31:41.44" data-timestamp="1901.44">If there had ever been a chance that Hyder would put his father into his audio diaries, that chance kind of vanished with the new job. After the new job, anything his father would say to him about Afghanistan would be essentially the government's official line on it. Imagine Jenna Bush trying to interview her dad about, say, the politics of the Senate, and you can see how delicate the whole thing would be.</p><p begin="00:32:06.80" data-timestamp="1926.8">Hyder's diaries continue with his father, Said Fazal Akbar, in his new job as government spokesman.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hyder Akbar</h4><p begin="00:32:16.80" data-timestamp="1936.8">OK.
