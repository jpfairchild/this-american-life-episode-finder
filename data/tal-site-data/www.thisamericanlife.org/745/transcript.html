That'll all make more sense in a minute. We had a totally different show planned for you today.</p><p begin="00:00:47.66" data-timestamp="47.66">But then, we came across this phone call. And it just seemed important to put it on the air now. It's from Monday, before the explosions around the airport that killed dozens of people.</p><p begin="00:00:57.26" data-timestamp="57.26">But it's a snapshot, in a way, from the last hours of this war, as the US leaves Afghanistan, when who would get out and who would not was all still being decided hour by hour. So what we're going to do on the show today is we're going to hear the story of that phone call. And then we're going to play you some other stories about getting out-- about people trying to extricate themselves from seemingly impossible situations.</p><p begin="00:01:20.55" data-timestamp="80.55">So the first guy you heard on the call, the guy in California, is Kirk Johnson. We've had him on the show before. And when things started to fall apart in Afghanistan, he reached out to us, because years ago, he did reconstruction work in Iraq for the US government. And since then, for a long time now, he's been trying to get people in Iraq and Afghanistan who have worked with the US government and who are in danger out of those countries.</p><p begin="00:01:44.15" data-timestamp="104.15">He started an organization back in 2007 called The List Project. So these past weeks, Kirk has been on the phone constantly. And on Monday night, with his kids asleep in the other room, he had this series of phone calls which he recorded with the man you heard. His name is Ajmal.</p><p begin="00:02:00.75" data-timestamp="120.75">And Kirk is trying to talk him through the crowds, and the confusion, and chaos around the airport in Afghanistan to try to get Ajmal and his family past all the barriers, hopefully onto a plane and out of the country. All of this is happening over the phone from half a world away. Nancy Updike here has known Kirk for many years. She talked to him about what happened. Here's Nancy.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:02:23.75" data-timestamp="143.75"> Kirk didn't know Ajmal before Monday night. He never met him. He just heard this was a person who needed help-- one of the many people who needed help, whose names have been piling up in these threads Kirk has been on all week-- group chats with US veterans, active military, current and former diplomats and aid workers, some Afghan citizens of the US and other countries, all on their phones day and night, trying to help Afghans get out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:02:49.49" data-timestamp="169.49"> Ajmal, can you hear me?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:02:50.39" data-timestamp="170.39"> Monday night, Kirk called Ajmal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:02:52.13" data-timestamp="172.13"> I can hear you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:02:53.19" data-timestamp="173.19"> OK, so are you still in front of the Canadian, or not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:02:58.31" data-timestamp="178.31"> Yeah, in front of the Canadian, in the water.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:03:02.45" data-timestamp="182.45"> You're in the water right now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:03:05.54" data-timestamp="185.54"> Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:03:06.71" data-timestamp="186.71"> The Canadian is a Canadian soldier, and the water is the canal right outside the Kabul airport.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:03:12.32" data-timestamp="192.32"> [? This ?] is not [INAUDIBLE], don't know--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:03:13.52" data-timestamp="193.52"> The only thing Ajmal is trying to do here, the whole thing, is to slog his way to within earshot of the one Canadian soldier he can see and make himself heard above the crowd.</p><p begin="00:03:24.49" data-timestamp="204.49">[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:03:27.31" data-timestamp="207.31"> Canada!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:03:29.66" data-timestamp="209.66"> Ajmal worked for an NGO funded by the United States. And now, he and his family need to leave-- him, his parents, and his brother. They're luckier than most of the people around them, because they have citizenship in another country. He and his family are all Canadian citizens.</p><p begin="00:03:47.33" data-timestamp="227.33">And please picture this young Canadian, Ajmal. Kirk sent me a photo of him in the canal. Ajmal is 27 years old. Pretty sure he could pass for 19 without his goatee.</p><p begin="00:03:58.01" data-timestamp="238.01">He's slight, big glasses, wearing his backpack in front of him on his chest, like a nervous tourist. He is knee-deep in water. On one side of the canal is a growing crowd of Afghans. On the other are soldiers. And behind the soldiers is the path to get into the airport.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:04:16.82" data-timestamp="256.82"> Do-- do you know their name, or no?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:19.61" data-timestamp="259.61"> The-- no. The soldier's name? No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:04:24.24" data-timestamp="264.24"> Please wait, OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:25.56" data-timestamp="265.56"> OK, I'm waiting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:04:27.35" data-timestamp="267.35"> Exactly how Ajmal came to be standing in a canal is, hours earlier, he'd received an email with instructions for what to do, how to get out. He forwarded the email to Kirk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:38.97" data-timestamp="278.97"> Here's the email that Ajmal got at 3:01 AM from-- from the Canadian government.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:04:48.77" data-timestamp="288.77"> Kirk read the key part.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:04:50.66" data-timestamp="290.66"> Important instructions-- go to The Baron Hotel immediately-- all caps. Do not wear Western style clothing-- all caps. Be prepared to wait for many hours. Once inside, go to the garden and sit under the Canadian flag and wait for Canadian officials. Bring food and water, if possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:14.89" data-timestamp="314.89"> That's the official process here. Get yourself to a hotel garden, sit down under a flag. Do this immediately somehow. Bring water. Ajmal and his family had gone to the place they thought was The Baron Hotel, but it was the wrong place. No Canadian officials they could see-- seemed to be all British people.</p><p begin="00:05:35.31" data-timestamp="335.31">So Kirk drew a map, looking at Google Maps, with the route Ajmal, his parents, and his brother needed to take, through more crowds, to get to the right place. The canal, believe it or not, was the right place-- or as close as they were able to get. The canal is next to The Baron Hotel.</p><p begin="00:05:53.91" data-timestamp="353.91">And there was a Canadian soldier there. They could see him. He had a little Canadian flag on his uniform. But he kept stepping away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:06:02.07" data-timestamp="362.07"> OK, is he back?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:06:03.00" data-timestamp="363"> Yeah, they are talking with the [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:06:05.06" data-timestamp="365.06"> He's talking to someone else right now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:06:06.27" data-timestamp="366.27"> He's talking with someone else. I'm waiting for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:06:07.89" data-timestamp="367.89"> OK. Jesus Christ.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:13.03" data-timestamp="373.03"> Ajmal is trying to get the soldier's attention, because, as I keep saying, Ajmal is a citizen of Canada. He is not a supplicant. He has the right papers. But Ajmal, who comes across as a cautious, rule-following sort of person, with his face mask pulled neatly under his chin in case he's ever inside again, that young man is stuck in a canal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:06:35.06" data-timestamp="395.06"> I'll be patient. Don't--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ajmal</h4><p begin="00:06:36.02" data-timestamp="396.02"> Excuse me? Hey, Canada? Canada?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kirk Johnson</h4><p begin="00:06:42.34" data-timestamp="402.34"> Oh my god.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:43.67" data-timestamp="403.67"> Other people in this same situation might have no trouble bellowing to get someone's attention.

Back when she was a teenager, one of our co-workers, Elna Baker, found herself in that position.</p><p begin="00:21:13.36" data-timestamp="1273.36">She was trapped in a hotel room with her siblings, held there by a stranger. What happened was, their family was all staying at this Marriott. But they're such a big family that the parents and the oldest kid were in one room. Elna and the three other kids were next door in their own room.</p><p begin="00:21:29.02" data-timestamp="1289.02">There was Elna, who was 14 at the time, Julia, who was 10, Briton, who was eight, and Jill, who was five. Elna was sharing a bed with her. Elna, who was in eighth grade at the time, was more or less in charge.</p><p begin="00:21:41.68" data-timestamp="1301.68">And then one night, they're all asleep. It's the middle of the night. She told this all to Ira.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:21:46.75" data-timestamp="1306.75"> My memory is that-- it's like-- I saw like, a sliver of light, which is what woke me up, and the sound of the door closing. And there was the feeling that there was someone standing at the foot of the bed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:58.96" data-timestamp="1318.96"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:22:00.19" data-timestamp="1320.19"> So I reached over, and I turned the lamp on.

She cried the whole time she was there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:03.88" data-timestamp="1383.88"> She's crying, and she said, you're children.

I distinctly remember my little brothers' and sisters' faces, because their eyes were just huge. But no one said anything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:23.73" data-timestamp="1403.73"> And are they sitting up, too, or are they just laying flat still?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:23:26.73" data-timestamp="1406.73"> They're still laying flat. Nobody moved.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:37.18" data-timestamp="1417.18"> So what happens next?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:23:38.74" data-timestamp="1418.74"> She's talking, right? This isn't how it was supposed to be. And she's also crying. And she's talking to herself. I remember it being very hard to follow what she was saying.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:52.87" data-timestamp="1432.87"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:23:53.47" data-timestamp="1433.47"> And eventually, I said, I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong room. And she started to cry. And she said, I know, I know. I do this, I do this. I don't know why I do this.</p><p begin="00:24:10.17" data-timestamp="1450.17">And then she's pacing back and forth, and kind of crying. And she sits down on the bed, at the foot of the bed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:19.20" data-timestamp="1459.2"> Did she seem crazy, or did she seem upset?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:24:22.79" data-timestamp="1462.79"> I mean, it's interesting. I was-- I think I-- I was too young and unfamiliar to identify what a crazy person seems like.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:30.64" data-timestamp="1470.64"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:24:31.22" data-timestamp="1471.22"> But what I could identify in that moment was that this person was unpredictable.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:37.40" data-timestamp="1477.4"> So you guys were like, oh, I've got to be really careful how I do this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:24:40.41" data-timestamp="1480.41"> I remember feeling that pressure, and in that moment, very, very, very aware of my brothers and sisters, because they were so little. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:52.30" data-timestamp="1492.3"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:24:52.66" data-timestamp="1492.66"> --that something bad could happen to them. And that the way that it wasn't going to happen to them was me. There were no adults there. I think it was the first situation I was ever in where there was-- you couldn't defer to someone else to keep you safe or tell you what to do. And what do I do?</p><p begin="00:25:17.79" data-timestamp="1517.79">And it had that quality of like-- like, time slows down. And you're kind of-- you're there, but you're also watching. And so then, I did the math in my head. And I was like, OK, I have a couple options. They are cry for help, scream. But I don't think anyone will hear.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:45.57" data-timestamp="1545.57"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:25:48.24" data-timestamp="1548.24"> I remember looking at how far away the phone was from me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:51.36" data-timestamp="1551.36"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:25:52.14" data-timestamp="1552.14"> And I realized I can reach and grab the phone, and I could call for help. Or even like, if I could knock on the door where my sister was--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:03.41" data-timestamp="1563.41"> Sister in the connecting room next door.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:26:05.87" data-timestamp="1565.87"> I could at least-- they would know something was happening in here. And they could get to us in time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:10.40" data-timestamp="1570.4"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:26:11.51" data-timestamp="1571.51"> But all of that felt like an escalation, like I would provoke her. And so what can I do to not provoke her and kind of play up the fact that we're children? And what I felt I needed to do was I needed to calm her down and become her friend. And if I could become her friend, she would leave, and she wouldn't hurt us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:38.10" data-timestamp="1598.1"> Like, get her to see you as a person?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:26:40.14" data-timestamp="1600.14"> Just make her think I was on her side. Because then-- it didn't feel like she didn't see us as people. It just felt like-- it felt dangerous, and I didn't understand why. And I felt like the key to being safe was slowing everything down.</p><p begin="00:27:10.02" data-timestamp="1630.02">And I remember her saying, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm here. I'm sorry I'm doing this. I'm sorry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:15.53" data-timestamp="1635.53"> Mhm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:27:15.81" data-timestamp="1635.81"> And I don't remember this, but my brother remembers that what she said was, I'm sorry, girls. I'm sorry, girls. And that his whole memory of this night was just being like, I'm a boy. [LAUGHS] He was so mad.</p><p begin="00:27:32.42" data-timestamp="1652.42">And so I ask her-- I said, are you OK? Is everything OK? And that's-- she kept, you know, going on about how her night was so hard.</p><p begin="00:27:42.97" data-timestamp="1662.97">And I was like, I'm so sorry. That sounds really, really difficult.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:46.89" data-timestamp="1666.89"> And this is you trying to befriend her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:27:48.66" data-timestamp="1668.66"> Yeah, this is me trying to befriend her. But it's weird, I feel like-- I was hyper alert to like, if I can understand what's going on with her, I can help solve it. But I couldn't understand, because it didn't make any sense.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:00.93" data-timestamp="1680.93"> Did you feel sorry for her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:28:02.82" data-timestamp="1682.82"> I felt concerned for her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:05.71" data-timestamp="1685.71"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:28:06.98" data-timestamp="1686.98"> And-- and then she took out her purse. And she reached into her purse, and then she gripped onto something. And I remember thinking like, oh no, like, what-- the way-- like, if that--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:19.10" data-timestamp="1699.1"> Oh, like, it's like a gun or something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:28:20.45" data-timestamp="1700.45"> Right, gun, or a knife or something. I remember my heart just dropping. And then she pulled out a hairbrush. And then she just started brushing her hair, like, at the foot of my bed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:31.19" data-timestamp="1711.19"> Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:28:31.99" data-timestamp="1711.99"> And-- and then at that point, I was like, this is really weird. Like, this is like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:38.75" data-timestamp="1718.75"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:28:40.31" data-timestamp="1720.31"> And I don't think she's going to leave. And then she sat on the vanity in front of the mirror, at the desk. And she took her earrings off. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:00.19" data-timestamp="1740.19"> Oh, wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:29:01.21" data-timestamp="1741.21"> And she started like-- she took her shoes off. She took her coat off. She was just like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:06.80" data-timestamp="1746.8"> Oh, wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:29:07.72" data-timestamp="1747.72"> --making herself comfortable to like, be here now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:11.75" data-timestamp="1751.75"> Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:29:12.31" data-timestamp="1752.31"> And so I let her do all that, and was sort of listening to her go on about what was wrong. And then eventually, after I felt like enough time had passed, I said, we have to wake up early to go to school tomorrow. And we're really tired, so I think we should probably go back to bed now.</p><p begin="00:29:39.42" data-timestamp="1779.42">And she was like, I know, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry I'm here. And I said, no, it's totally fine that you're here-- almost like, you know, thank you for being here. But do you mind leaving now?</p><p begin="00:29:55.55" data-timestamp="1795.55">And so I very slowly stood up and walked over to the door. And every moment was like making sure I was safe. And then I open the door.</p><p begin="00:30:07.77" data-timestamp="1807.77">And she said, OK, OK. And she put her shoes on, and then she started to leave. And just as she was about to leave, I said, oh, you forgot your earrings. And then she was like-- started crying all over again, like it was this huge thing, walked over to get the earrings, and then sat back down on the bed.</p><p begin="00:30:26.41" data-timestamp="1826.41">And I remember thinking like, goddamn, why did I bring up the earrings? We were so close to being safe. So then the whole thing-- basically, the whole thing started all over again, where I had to like, listen to her cry, calm her down. And then finally, I'm like, you know, we have to wake up early to go to school. Do you mind leaving?</p><p begin="00:30:49.75" data-timestamp="1849.75">And I walked her to the door. And she walked out of the door. And then as soon as she was out of the door, I just pushed the door as hard as I could to close it. And when I pushed it, like basically slammed it shut, she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:08.45" data-timestamp="1868.45"> And is there a bolt or something on the door?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:31:10.61" data-timestamp="1870.61"> I think I did bolt it after I slammed it shut.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:12.71" data-timestamp="1872.71"> Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:31:13.22" data-timestamp="1873.22"> And then I heard her screaming in the hallway. And then she ran down the hallway, screaming. And then she ran back towards the door, screaming. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:21.47" data-timestamp="1881.47"> That must have been terrifying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:31:22.58" data-timestamp="1882.58"> It was so scary. And then-- then it got-- was quiet. And then I heard this loud-- she's like banging on the door, like as hard as she can, right?</p><p begin="00:31:33.66" data-timestamp="1893.66">And then I hear a voice, and it's my dad. And my dad's like, open the door. Open the door. And I realize it's not her banging on the door.</p><p begin="00:31:42.08" data-timestamp="1902.08">So I open the door. And my dad's standing there, and he's like, did you hear someone screaming in the hallway? So then I tell him this whole story.</p><p begin="00:31:54.56" data-timestamp="1914.56">I'm like, there was this woman. She was in our room. I tell him all the details. And he is furious. He was so mad.</p><p begin="00:32:01.28" data-timestamp="1921.28">And then he told us to stay there, shut the door, don't open the door. And then he went downstairs and talked to the hotel about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:09.38" data-timestamp="1929.38"> Yeah, what did he learn?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:32:11.06" data-timestamp="1931.06"> They tell him that she had been outside. She was crying. They asked if she was a guest there. She said yes, her name was Elena Baker. And so they looked up the name.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:20.30" data-timestamp="1940.3"> Elena Baker?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:32:21.29" data-timestamp="1941.29"> Elena Baker, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:22.19" data-timestamp="1942.19"> And your name is Elna Baker.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:32:23.45" data-timestamp="1943.45"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:23.93" data-timestamp="1943.93"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:32:24.53" data-timestamp="1944.53"> But I don't believe this part of the story. I think someone at the hotel just said this to him to cover.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:29.39" data-timestamp="1949.39"> And then they gave her a key?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:32:30.83" data-timestamp="1950.83"> And then they gave her a key.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:31.66" data-timestamp="1951.66"> Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elna Baker</h4><p begin="00:32:32.36" data-timestamp="1952.36"> Yeah.

At the time, back when she was 14, her parents kept all that from her and her brother and sisters. They didn't want them to dwell on it or make them afraid of the world.

Instead, it would fit squarely into the category called victory-- solid win for 14-year-old girl in a big, religious family, when she got that stranger out of their hotel room without anybody getting hurt. And Elna says she would have liked that win.</p><p begin="00:35:20.21" data-timestamp="2120.21">When you're trapped inside a room with an unpredictable person, really, all you've got is your wits, and your ability to read the situation, and your judgment at guessing what will work. Nice to show everybody that even a kid can make the right call sometimes, if they pay attention closely enough.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:35:41.89" data-timestamp="2141.89"> Elna Baker, one of the producers of our show, talking to Ira Glass.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Three: You Can&#8217;t Go Your Own Way</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:35:51.12" data-timestamp="2151.12"> Act three-- You Can't Go Your Own Way. In her memoir, <i>In</i> <i>the</i> <i>Dream</i> <i>House,</i> Carmen Maria Machado wrote this chapter that's set up like a choose your own adventure story, which I just thought was so smart when I read it. In it, she imagines different choices she could have made with a partner that she's in a bad relationship with-- an abusive relationship.</p><p begin="00:36:11.71" data-timestamp="2171.71">And one of the things it captures is just the mental energy that somebody in that situation can end up putting into trying to figure out what they should do or not do to avoid setting off their partner. A heads up that this excerpt includes a scene with sexual content. It's read for us by actor Zoe Winters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zoe Winters</h4><p begin="00:36:28.55" data-timestamp="2188.55"> Page one. You wake up, and the air is milky and bright.

You think to yourself, this is the kind of morning you could get used to.</p><p begin="00:36:44.98" data-timestamp="2204.98">When you turn over, she is staring at you. The luminous innocence of the light curdles in your stomach. You don't remember ever going from awake to afraid so quickly.</p><p begin="00:36:56.41" data-timestamp="2216.41">You were moving all night, she says. Your arms and elbows touched me. You kept me awake.</p><p begin="00:37:05.38" data-timestamp="2225.38">If you apologize profusely, go to page two. If you tell her to wake you up next time your elbows touch her in your sleep, go to page three.

So weird. I must have--</p><p begin="00:37:37.19" data-timestamp="2257.19">Are you really sorry? She says. I don't think you are. I am, you say.</p><p begin="00:37:44.18" data-timestamp="2264.18">You want the first impression of the morning to return to you-- its freshness, its light. I really am. Prove it. How? Stop doing it.</p><p begin="00:37:54.38" data-timestamp="2274.38">I told you, I can't. Fuck you, she says, and gets out of bed. You follow her all the way to the kitchen.

If you do as you are told, go to page eight. If you tell her to do it herself, go to page five.</p><p begin="00:39:04.08" data-timestamp="2344.08">Page five-- are you kidding? You'd never do this.

You're out.</p><p begin="00:39:20.06" data-timestamp="2360.06">Wait, no, let's try that again. I go to page eight. Page eight-- as you're washing the dishes, you think to yourself, maybe I should put a tack on my forehead. Maybe I should be a better person.

I can't control how I move in my sleep.</p><p begin="00:40:33.18" data-timestamp="2433.18">You are such a fucking cunt, she says. You never take responsibility for anything. All you have to do is wake me up, you say, a kind of incoherent desperation zipping through your skull. That's it. Wake me up and tell me to move or sleep on the couch, and I will do it. I swear to you.</p><p begin="00:40:49.89" data-timestamp="2449.89">Fuck you, she says, and gets out of bed. You follow her to the kitchen.

You have voided your body so many times by now that it is force of habit, reflexive as a sigh. It reminds you of your first boyfriend, who [MUTED] you while watching porn, how he rutted and rutted, and then every so often, lifted the remote to rewind something you couldn't see.</p><p begin="00:42:17.73" data-timestamp="2537.73">Once, you turned your head over the lip of the bed and saw a tangle of upside-down limbs, and your brain couldn't make sense of them. You never looked again. You would just lie there silently, watching his face move over you. It was like being unfolded beneath the yawn of the planetarium as a kid-- the sped-up rotation of the Earth, the movement of the stars, the constellations melting into and out of being.</p><p begin="00:42:51.27" data-timestamp="2571.27">You shudder and moan with precision. She turns off the lights. You watch the darkness until the darkness leaves you, or you leave it.</p><p begin="00:43:08.94" data-timestamp="2588.94">To sleep, go to page 14. To dream about the present, go to page 13. To dream about the future, go to page 12.</p><p begin="00:43:19.92" data-timestamp="2599.92">To dream about the past, go to page 11. I want to dream about the past. I choose page 11.</p><p begin="00:43:28.69" data-timestamp="2608.69">Page 11-- the first time it happened. The first time she yelled at you so much you were crying within 30 seconds from waking-- a record. She said, the first 10 minutes of the day, I'm not responsible for anything I say. This struck you as poetic. You even wrote it down, sure you would find a place for it in a book, maybe. Go to page 14.</p><p begin="00:44:02.56" data-timestamp="2642.56">Page 9-- you shouldn't be on this page. There's no way to get here from the choices given to you. Do you think that, by flipping through this chapter linearly, you'd find some kind of relief? Don't you get it? All of this shit already happened. And you can't make it not happen, no matter what you do.</p><p begin="00:44:24.78" data-timestamp="2664.78">Do you want a picture of a fawn? Will that help? OK, here's a fawn. She is small, and dappled, and loose-legged.</p><p begin="00:44:36.32" data-timestamp="2676.32">She hears a sound, freezes, and then bolts. She knows what to do. She knows there's somewhere safer she can be. Go to page 10.</p><p begin="00:44:48.33" data-timestamp="2688.33">I don't want to go to page 10. Page 6-- you shouldn't be on this page. There's no way to get here from the choices given to you. You flipped here because you got sick of the cycle.</p><p begin="00:45:06.55" data-timestamp="2706.55">You wanted to get out. You're smarter than me. Go to page 10.</p><p begin="00:45:13.24" data-timestamp="2713.24">Fine. I go to page 10. Page 10-- that night, she fucks you as you lie there mutely, praying for it to be over, praying she won't notice you're gone. You have voided your body so many times by now that it is force of habit, reflexive as a sigh.</p><p begin="00:45:31.91" data-timestamp="2731.91">It reminds you of your first-- the sped-up rotation of the Earth, the movement of the stars, the constellations melting into and out of being.

To dream about the present, go to page 13.</p><p begin="00:45:59.40" data-timestamp="2759.4">Page 13-- you shouldn't be here, but it's OK. It's a dream. She can't find you here. In a minute, you're going to wake up, and everything is going to seem like it's the same, but it's not.</p><p begin="00:46:14.15" data-timestamp="2774.15">There's a way out. Are you listening to me? You can't forget when you wake up. You can't go to page 14.</p><p begin="00:46:23.39" data-timestamp="2783.39">I want to dream about the future. I go to page 12. Page 12-- it's going to be all right.</p><p begin="00:46:32.06" data-timestamp="2792.06">One day, your wife will gently adjust your arm if it touches her face at night, soothingly straightening it while kissing you. Sometimes, you will wake up just enough to notice. Other times, she'll only tell you in the morning. It's the kind of morning you could get used to. Go to page 14.</p><p begin="00:46:51.77" data-timestamp="2811.77">Page 14-- you wake up, and the air is milky and bright. The room glows with a kind of effervescent contentment, despite the boxes, and clothes, and dishes. You think to yourself, this is the kind of morning you could get used to.</p><p begin="00:47:04.40" data-timestamp="2824.4">When you turn over, she is staring at you. The luminous innocence of the light curdles in your stomach.

If you tell her to wake you up next time your elbows touch her in your sleep, go to page three. If you toss back the blankets from your body and hit the floor with both feet, and tear through the house like it's Pamplona, and when you get to the driveway, your car keys are already in your hand, and you drive away with a theatrical squeal of the tires, never to return again, go to page 15.</p><p begin="00:47:37.16" data-timestamp="2857.16">Page 15-- that's not how it happened, but OK, we can pretend. I'll give it to you, just this once. Turn to page 16.</p><p begin="00:47:53.29" data-timestamp="2873.29">Page 16-- an end. In the pit of it, you fantasize about dying-- tripping on a sidewalk, and stumbling into the path of an oncoming car, a gas leak silently offing you in your sleep, a machete-wielding madman on public transit, falling down the stairs, but drunk, so you flop, limb over limb, like a marionette, and feel no pain-- anything to make it stop. You have forgotten that leaving is an option.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:32.30" data-timestamp="2912.3"> Zoe Winters reading a chapter from Carmen Maria Machado's memoir, <i>In</i> <i>the</i> <i>Dream</i> <i>House.</i> Carmen has a comic series out now called <i>The</i> <i>Low,</i> <i>Low</i> <i>Woods,</i> from DC Comics.

<h3>Act Four: Blue Kid on the Block</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:48:48.27" data-timestamp="2928.27"> Act four-- Blue Kid on the Block. This last story is about what happens after you get out-- in this particular case, when you get out of Rochester, New York. The kid in this story, who we're going to call Leo-- it's not his real name-- his family had moved to an entirely different state. And he was not happy about it.</p><p begin="00:49:07.18" data-timestamp="2947.18">At the time, Leo was just starting seventh grade. He was having a harder time finding his place in middle school than other middle school kids, because, you know, he was new to town, but also because Leo still loved Rochester. He loved his school there. He loved his friends. Suddenly, everything about his life was different, and according to Leo, much worse.</p><p begin="00:49:26.65" data-timestamp="2966.65">The signature on his Gmail account now read, Rochester is much better, in big, red letters. Sarah Koenig knows Leo and his parents. She visited them at home to see how Leo is doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:49:38.69" data-timestamp="2978.69"> This is how much Leo does not want to be here-- when I got to his house, he was on the sofa with a laptop, investigating Greyhound bus schedules. His mother was going to drive him and his sister back to Rochester for the Columbus Day weekend, but not until Saturday morning. And Leo wanted to get there Friday for more time with his friends.</p><p begin="00:49:55.82" data-timestamp="2995.82">A multi-stage negotiation followed with his dad. For one thing, a bus ticket costs money.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:50:00.60" data-timestamp="3000.6"> That's not the-- that's not a problem. [? I have that money-- ?]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:02.30" data-timestamp="3002.3"> Not for you. No, that wasn't a problem for you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:50:04.01" data-timestamp="3004.01"> No, but--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:05.36" data-timestamp="3005.36"> There isn't one, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:50:06.12" data-timestamp="3006.12"> There isn't one-- not at 6:15 in the morning. And you won't let me miss school on Friday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo's Dad</h4><p begin="00:50:10.58" data-timestamp="3010.58"> The bus takes eight hours. Even if you left at noon, you'd be at-- are gonna do the math? That's excellent.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:16.16" data-timestamp="3016.16"> Never mind that the bus takes twice as long as driving, and never mind that Leo would be alone, and have to change buses, and that his parents had no intention of letting him go through with this plan. But it's the kind of negotiation you indulge when your kid is miserable. And Leo is miserable. He told me right away he was, and that he had been from the moment he got here in August.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:35.70" data-timestamp="3035.7"> Is this the first time you've-- in your life where you felt like you've been sad about something for this long?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:50:42.99" data-timestamp="3042.99"> I think so, except for maybe when my other cat died-- my old cat.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:48.49" data-timestamp="3048.49"> And does this feel worse than that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:50:51.05" data-timestamp="3051.05"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:50:52.06" data-timestamp="3052.06"> Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:50:52.94" data-timestamp="3052.94"> Mhm. I've never had long periods of sad until now. I don't know. I don't know anyone here, really. And I think it's just everything in general that's overwhelming.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:51:13.19" data-timestamp="3073.19"> Back in Rochester, Leo had known all his best friends since kindergarten or before. They played together at school, after school, on weekends. Everybody knew everybody. Everything was comfortable.</p><p begin="00:51:23.90" data-timestamp="3083.9">And as a sixth grader in his old school, he and his friends were at the top of the heap. They wore green sashes in the morning, and got to be door monitors for the younger kids coming into the building. So imagine now, Leo takes a school bus for the first time to his new school, a sprawling one-story building full of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders.</p><p begin="00:51:41.15" data-timestamp="3101.15">Leo's small for his age, only a hair taller than his sister, who's only nine years old. On day one, he knows exactly no one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:51:48.32" data-timestamp="3108.32"> It was much louder than my old school, much louder. People talking, people closing and opening lockers. People walking-- it was just noise. Just older kids, more kids, because my old school was tiny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:52:06.58" data-timestamp="3126.58"> Leo is between. He's old enough to decipher Greyhound bus schedules, but not old enough to actually travel on one by himself, and old enough to know that, if he's going to survive in middle school, he has to make friends, but that making those friends stands to be significantly more complicated than it was back in Rochester. Leo's sister, Auden, is in fourth grade. He says she's not having as hard a time of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:52:28.61" data-timestamp="3148.61"> She hasn't been alive as long. She hasn't made as deep connections. And she's already met some-- a friend in her school. I think it's easier to make friends in elementary school than in middle school.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:52:39.67" data-timestamp="3159.67"> Oh, really? Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:52:41.02" data-timestamp="3161.02"> Because people care less about who you are.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:52:44.62" data-timestamp="3164.62"> What do you mean by that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:52:46.15" data-timestamp="3166.15"> The older you get, the more you judge people on their looks, their background, their-- how they act, like, what cool is for kids. Because in kindergarten, you could just walk up to someone and say, do you want to be my friend? And they would-- then, that would be it. But it's harder.</p><p begin="00:53:10.56" data-timestamp="3190.56">I just think people are more wary before they open up. They like-- I don't know, in first grade, if I met someone, I wouldn't really care who they were. I would just care if they were nice or not.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:53:24.68" data-timestamp="3204.68"> The day I interviewed him, Leo had had a couple of breakthroughs. He emailed his parents during the school day to tell them the first piece of good news they'd had from him. Until that day, the emails had mostly been three desperate words-- I feel awful. Without even a period at the end to make the feeling finite, it was an endless awful.</p><p begin="00:53:41.84" data-timestamp="3221.84">But on this Thursday, he wrote to tell them the mashed potatoes they serve in the cafeteria were great, followed by four exclamation points. Second-- and this was the big news-- he asked another kid if he wanted to come over. Leo told me he thought about it first for a few days, then finally emailed the boy, whose name is Devin, another seventh grader.</p><p begin="00:54:00.56" data-timestamp="3240.56">But now, Leo didn't want to call Devin's house to finalize a plan. He dreaded the awkwardness of the phone. So his dad called Devin's parents, introduced himself as Leo's father.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo's Dad</h4><p begin="00:54:09.32" data-timestamp="3249.32"> --dad. He goes to school with your son, Evan. And we were-- Devin-- I'm so sorry, Devin. I'm getting the evil look from my son. I apologize. But we're hoping Devin can come over on Sunday. Thanks. I panicked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:54:23.64" data-timestamp="3263.64"> Dad, you fool! [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:54:26.96" data-timestamp="3266.96"> How'd that go?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:54:28.04" data-timestamp="3268.04"> Not well.</p><p begin="00:54:28.79" data-timestamp="3268.79">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:54:31.95" data-timestamp="3271.95"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo's Dad</h4><p begin="00:54:32.42" data-timestamp="3272.42"> This is my son, Freddy.</p><p begin="00:54:33.60" data-timestamp="3273.6">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:54:35.06" data-timestamp="3275.06"> I thought Leo might be upset about it, maybe get sulky. But here he was, cracking up, joking with his dad.
