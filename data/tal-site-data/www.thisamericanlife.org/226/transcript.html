<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.69" data-timestamp="1.69"> Ladies and gentlemen, public radio listeners everywhere, now let us praise famous crap, OK, and not so famous crap too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:00:11.07" data-timestamp="11.07"> Well, there's a show called <i>Boy</i> <i>Meets</i> <i>World</i>. You ever seen it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:15.49" data-timestamp="15.49"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:00:16.26" data-timestamp="16.26"> It's great. It's so good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:17.56" data-timestamp="17.56"> It's in syndication?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:00:18.44" data-timestamp="18.44"> Yeah, it's one of those shows that just went under the radar.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:22.66" data-timestamp="22.66"> Friends, we are not here today to talk about those supposedly good TV programs people who think that they're smart like to talk about when they talk about TV. We're here to talk about the stuff that makes up so much of TV. We're here to speak of reruns. And not good reruns at that, I'm talking your <i>Matlock</i>s, your <i>Living</i> <i>Singles</i>, your <i>Kate &amp;</i> <i>Allies</i>. This voice you are hearing is Starlee Kine, one of the producers of our radio program. And I asked her to talk about her relationship to TV, because she's the first person I've ever met who actively prefers reruns like <i>Boy</i> <i>Meets</i> <i>World</i>.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:00:54.75" data-timestamp="54.75"> And it just like was on for years, but you never knew it. And now it's just like permanently in reruns, and it's on like four different channels. But it's not very good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:03.72" data-timestamp="63.72"> In fact, is it actually bad?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:01:05.64" data-timestamp="65.64"> I think so. I mean, it's hard for me to tell at this point, but it's bad, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:09.74" data-timestamp="69.74"> So if it's bad, why are you watching?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:01:11.85" data-timestamp="71.85"> It's very, very, very comforting to watch it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:16.02" data-timestamp="76.02"> It's comforting because you used to watch it when you were a little kid?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:01:19.12" data-timestamp="79.12"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:19.72" data-timestamp="79.72"> You never saw it as a kid?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:01:20.54" data-timestamp="80.54"> No, not that one. But <i>Boy</i> <i>Meets</i> <i>World</i>, it's like it didn't even matter that I didn't watch it as a little kid. I can imagine little kids being in really comfortable, carpeted family rooms and laying with their elbows propped up and watching <i>Boy</i> <i>Meets</i> <i>World</i> and feeling really safe. Because it's like the safest thing in the world. This family is so nuclear, it's perfect. But it's soundstages, and it looks really fake. The principal is also the kid's neighbor. You know what I mean? He's just always there and always looking after everyone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Russ In Boy Meets World</h4><p begin="00:01:52.82" data-timestamp="112.82"> Hey son, how was your day?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Savage In Boy Meets World</h4><p begin="00:01:53.55" data-timestamp="113.55"> Fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Russ In Boy Meets World</h4><p begin="00:01:54.24" data-timestamp="114.24">What did you do in school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Savage In Boy Meets World</h4><p begin="00:01:54.78" data-timestamp="114.78">Nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Russ In Boy Meets World</h4><p begin="00:01:55.23" data-timestamp="115.23">Hey, hold on right there. You know, every day I ask you, what did you do. And every day you tell me, nothing. Well, I'm tired of nothing. I mean, we both know something happened today. And I want to know what it is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben Savage In Boy Meets World</h4><p begin="00:02:08.58" data-timestamp="128.58"> I decided to be a girl.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:02:11.92" data-timestamp="131.92"> I would imagine, if I were a little kid watching it, I'd feel so secure. Knowing that there's kids out there who feel secure is enough for me to feel comforted by it and watch it every time its on.</p><p begin="00:02:29.36" data-timestamp="149.36">I try very hard to establish these things so that I have these reruns, because I live in eternal fear that the reruns are going to be gone. Like last night, I was watching TV and I couldn't find a rerun anywhere and I was panicking. The <i>Godfather</i> was on, and I was flipping, flipping, and I couldn't find one. I was just like, how is this possible? There was a rerun though. It was a rerun of <i>The</i> <i>Nanny</i> was on. And I don't have any relationship with it, so I was stuck.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:00.36" data-timestamp="180.36"> Because she's so scared of that happening, Starlee is perpetually cultivating new reruns, forcing yourself to immerse in them. Her latest is <i>Caroline</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i>.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:03:08.04" data-timestamp="188.04"> When I watch <i>Caroline</i> <i>in the</i> <i>City</i>, it's like I'm really trying to find something, even though I hate it so much, so much. I hate it, every part of it. Hate the way she draws. I hate the way she talks. I hate her assistant, everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:23.78" data-timestamp="203.78"> And as you've watched <i>Caroline</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i> over the course of weeks, do you now actually like it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:03:31.30" data-timestamp="211.3"> I don't like it. But I know it. I am very familiar with it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:39.14" data-timestamp="219.14"> And that's enough?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:03:39.81" data-timestamp="219.81"> That's enough.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:44.96" data-timestamp="224.96"> What percentage of television is about just straight up comfort and what percentage is about what we think of, traditionally, as entertainment?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:03:52.72" data-timestamp="232.72"> For me? Oh God, 80% is about comfort for me. If something good gets in there it's an accident. Or it's because I feel obligated to watch something good, because I know people are going to ask me the next day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:10.31" data-timestamp="250.31"> Well, today on our radio program, a defense of not going out into the world and looking for new experiences, a defense of dwelling on what you already know, a defense of staying caught in your own personal reruns. Stories of people who have the same thing going on with some story from their own past that Starlee has with <i>Caroline</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i> and <i>Boy</i> <i>Meets</i> <i>World</i>.</p><p begin="00:04:29.11" data-timestamp="269.11">From WBEZ Chicago, it is <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Our program today in three, yes three, acts. Act One-- Action! Action! Action! In that act the story of what happens when a person, who actually has the power to create reruns, gets stuck in a rerun. Act Two-- Marriage As Rerun. In that act, an exploration, possibly, we think, the first ever, of how in every couple, in every marriage, we are stuck hearing the same stories from our partners over and over, and what we're supposed to think of that. Act Three-- Reruns At The Back Of The Bus. In that act, Sarah Vowell explains what happens when we, as a nation, keep telling ourselves the same political fable over and over long past the point where it makes any sense to. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Action! Action! Action!</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:26.34" data-timestamp="326.34"> Act One-- Action! Action! Action! Well, Starlee Kine, who you just met, somebody who loves reruns more than anyone who I've ever known, came upon a rerun moment. An entire film caught in a rerun in a way that dumbfounded even her. The film is called <i>The</i> <i>Beaver</i> <i>Trilogy</i>, and she put together this story about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:05:49.51" data-timestamp="349.51"> 10 minutes into watching <i>The</i> <i>Beaver</i> <i>Trilogy</i> I could already feel how much I'd be talking about it. Once it was over, I felt mournful that I'd never be able to see it again for the first time. Everything about it is so surprising and unexpected, the way movies almost never are. And what I'm going to try to do right now, here on the radio, is to recreate for you what it's like to see it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grooving Gary In The Beaver Trilogy</h4><p begin="00:06:09.65" data-timestamp="369.65"> Are you typing it? Oh, wow. When can I see this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:06:14.71" data-timestamp="374.71"> It's starts with a hand held camera moving up to a kid in the middle of an empty parking lot. The kid's taking pictures of a parked TV news traffic helicopter. He realizes he's being filmed, and starts into a John Wayne impersonation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grooving Gary In The Beaver Trilogy</h4><p begin="00:06:26.40" data-timestamp="386.4"> John Wayne? Here. Mom. Here is John Wayne. Yo, while I'll tell ya something out there in TV land, I'm hamming it up. I'll tell you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:06:37.62" data-timestamp="397.62"> The kid's wearing '70s clothes, bell-bottom jeans and a shirt with racing stripes. He has a Casio watch on. He looks to be in his early 20s. He cycles through a couple more impersonations, Barry Manilow, Rocky Balboa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grooving Gary In The Beaver Trilogy</h4><p begin="00:06:50.57" data-timestamp="410.57"> He's a good guy, you know.

The Beaver Kid sits with his hair clipped back away from his face. The local mortician applies eye shadow, mascara, rouge, and lipstick. I'm guessing, because she's the most qualified person in town to do it, but no one explains.

You have no idea why it's happening again, this time to one of the most famous actors in the world. But I can explain. Shortly after Trent shot the talent show, he moved out to Hollywood with dreams of making it big. But his first film was an unlikely vehicle to stardom. A virtually plotless single character dramatization of the documentary he'd already made. He wrote out a script and started looking for a leading man.</p><p begin="00:15:40.45" data-timestamp="940.45">It was 1981. Sean Penn had just finished filming <i>Fast</i> <i>Times</i> <i>at</i> <i>Ridgemont High</i>, and within a year he'd be a full-fledged movie star.

And somebody said, you ought to call this guy, Sean Penn, on the phone. I didn't know who he was. I made him an addition for the role. And he came down to the place I was at, and rather than have him read lines, he decided that what he wanted to do was just become the character. And that he would follow me around for for the rest of the day. So he became my cousin Larry from Idaho. And then he just followed me around that day. And I introduced him to people as my cousin from Idaho named Larry. And he acted the part out. And it was really kind of funny, because a year later people would come up to me and say, boy your cousin's really become a big star.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mortician In The Beaver Trilogy</h4><p begin="00:16:59.68" data-timestamp="1019.68"> Let's get your wiggy on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sean Penn In The Beaver Trilogy</h4><p begin="00:17:01.79" data-timestamp="1021.79"> Let's get my wiggy on, and Olivia will just about be here.

It's shot on film. There's lighting and extras and actual sets. It also cost a lot more. Trent spent $50,000 on it. And, as is often the case in Hollywood, the big budget remake is not as good as the original. Trent adds a whole new backstory to make the Beaver Kid seem like an heroic outsider. People are constantly mocking him, sticking tacks on his chair, telling him he'll never make it onto TV. And the director is an oily, villainous, mustachioed type name Terrance. And just like in the Sean Penn version, Crispin pulls out a gun after the talent show and considers killing himself. He calls the director and begs him not to put the footage on TV.

So what you end up with is a series of movies that only make sense to the person who made them. The same story, over and over, with inexplicably happy endings thrown on. If I hadn't talked to Trent, I still would've loved these movies, but I would have had no idea what they were about. But that's OK. Because they weren't meant for us anyway.</p><p begin="00:26:18.73" data-timestamp="1578.73">After Trent finished the last version of the film in 1985, he did the same thing that he'd done with the first two, absolutely nothing. 13 years later, he came across all three of them in his closet and hooked them together onto one reel for the first time. He screened it at a local theater in Utah. One thing led to another, and he was invited to screen it at the Sundance Film Festival. For the first time in 22 years, Trent had to find the Beaver Kid. He had a friend track him down to invite him to Sundance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trent Harris</h4><p begin="00:26:48.09" data-timestamp="1608.09"> So I mean, you've got to imagine this. You've got to take this into perspective. Is that he doesn't know. This happens in 1979 and in 2001 he gets a phone call that says this is going to play at the Sundance Film Festival. Well, just before the show starts, the tickets haven't been picked up. What happens is that we show the movie. It's a huge screening. There are 1,400 people there.</p><p begin="00:27:13.84" data-timestamp="1633.84">And after the screening, there's a bunch of people run up to the stage and ask more questions, stuff like that. All of a sudden, out of this sea of faces, one emerges. And he says, you probably don't remember me. And I immediately recognized who he was. And I grabbed him and dragged him out the side door into a snow drift.</p><p begin="00:27:36.20" data-timestamp="1656.2">There was a lot of, huh, well, I mean, what have you-- well, I mean, wow-- That was really something. I can't believe. And then I'd say something like, yeah, I mean, wow, I tried to find you, but I didn't know where you were. And look at all this snow, and here comes a bunch of people. And then he'd say, oh my gosh, and I still have that car. And oh, you must think I'm some sort or a nut. And what in the heck is going on? Where all these people coming from? Do they think I'm some sort of a nut? Ans I said, No, no, everybody loves you, it's great. I mean, it was that kind of a conversation.</p><p begin="00:28:03.79" data-timestamp="1683.79">And then we're mobbed. All of the sudden, there's 50 people standing around taking pictures and asking for his autograph. He doen't know. He just starts signing autographs, and then kind of slipped right into it as if he'd been doing it for years.</p><p begin="00:28:26.56" data-timestamp="1706.56">After the screening, I took him to the big Sundance party at the end of the festival. There is a huge, huge party under a big tent. The room's filled with movie stars and all kinds of glamorous people drinking champagne and having a heck of time. And nobody cared about the movie stars. They were all around him. They're asking him questions and getting his autograph. And beautiful women hanging on his arm and running off to get him a glass of beer. It was incredible. It was great. Literally, he was the biggest star in the room.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:28:57.03" data-timestamp="1737.03"> So was it a relief?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trent Harris</h4><p begin="00:29:00.26" data-timestamp="1740.26"> It was a tremendous relief for me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:29:03.51" data-timestamp="1743.51"> Trent kept remaking the same film because he wanted it to come out right. He wanted to give the kid a happy ending. And somehow, the plan worked. The Beaver Kid wanted to be a star. 22 years passed, and in the end, he was. And what happened in between doesn't have to make sense.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:22.87" data-timestamp="1762.87"> Starlee Kine.

And you hear the music begin to creep up. And then over the horizon comes my car, in a cloud of dust, and I come. And I whip right up in front of the camera, and I screech to a halt.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose some theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. If you're just tuning in today, we are talking about reruns, personal reruns. We've arrive at Act 2 of our program. Act Two, Marriage As Rerun. And let us begin this act with this scene of people stuck in personal reruns. A scene, I would bet, that you have probably been in yourself at one point or another.</p><p begin="00:32:10.04" data-timestamp="1930.04">Carmen and Candido were out just the other night with a friend. And Carmen started telling a story about her nephew, Nikko.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carmen</h4><p begin="00:32:16.36" data-timestamp="1936.36"> And as soon as I say, well, when Nikko was three years old, one Sunday.

But have you noticed that of all the stories that could get told in front of each other, only certain stories do get told? Well, to understand the taxonomy of this, the ins and outs of this phenomenon, I spoke with three couples.</p><p begin="00:33:17.66" data-timestamp="1997.66">We begin with Carmen and Candido. There is a story that he tells about the day that he got hurt on the subway and strangers came to his aid. They live in New York City. And this story comes up in any conversation where it might be necessary to prove the point that New Yorkers are not cold hearted but, in fact, helpful and kind to each other. There are the stories that she tells about her nephew Nikko, which come up on when the topic of kids doing adorable things enters a conversation with her friends, usually with friends who have kids. And then there's the graduation story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candido</h4><p begin="00:33:45.49" data-timestamp="2025.49"> Whenever they're talking about embarrassing moments, I guess this is the one that gets told a lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carmen</h4><p begin="00:33:50.25" data-timestamp="2030.25"> It comes up.

And [INAUDIBLE] of those Instamatic Kodak cameras. And she didn't advance the film when my name was called. And I went up there, and I received my diploma, and she didn't get a shot of that. So she goes, go back up there. I was like, mom, you are not making me go back up there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:34.12" data-timestamp="2074.12"> Oh my God.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carmen</h4><p begin="00:34:35.02" data-timestamp="2075.02"> Yeah, completely.

She's by the altar. And she goes, "Father Bradley, just hold on. Go back up there. Go back up there right now." Father Bradley posed, and she took the picture. And she goes, "OK, thank you. Oh, my baby!" And hugging me. Everybody is staring at me. And what I love about that moment, when I think about it, is that my mom didn't care what other people thought.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Candido</h4><p begin="00:35:14.24" data-timestamp="2114.24"> Exactly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:35:22.88" data-timestamp="2122.88"> I've probably heard this story 20 or 25 times.</p><p begin="00:35:26.69" data-timestamp="2126.69">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN I would guess that she's probably heard it six to eight times.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:35:30.88" data-timestamp="2130.88"> It seems like a lot.</p><p begin="00:35:33.13" data-timestamp="2133.13">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN I think she thinks it's pretty funny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:35.44" data-timestamp="2135.44"> This is our second couple, John and Catherine, who've known each other since high school. The story in question happened when they were both 21, both briefly living in England. It's a drinking story to be told while drinking about a night of drinking. John was the one who was drunk in the story. He was young. He was working lousy jobs. He was absolutely bored. So there was a lot of drinking in his life.</p><p begin="00:35:55.97" data-timestamp="2155.97">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN It was around this time that I also started doing some very low-key shoplifting. And I would take like a pack of gum, or like an onion. And this was very thrilling to me.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:36:11.74" data-timestamp="2171.74"> So one night John's friend Charles and another friend suggested they break into the London Zoo. Which at that time turned out to be surprisingly easy to do. They simply hopped over a low iron wrought fence. Once inside, they spotted a pool, with penguins sleeping all around it, right there behind a wall so low that you just step over it.</p><p begin="00:36:30.66" data-timestamp="2190.66">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN Yeah, it was exciting, because I'd always liked penguins. I've now learned that they are kind of shifty and mean and also harbingers of doom. I simply stepped over the wall, and I walked down and walked up to a sleeping penguin. Apparently they are diurnal creatures, and they sleep at night. And this one was not very happy about being woken up, because I petted him a little, and he bit me on the finger. It was not a major wound, but it was a token of bad things to come.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:03.55" data-timestamp="2223.55"> I have to say, as a symbolic moment, it's a good one. Because something cute has suddenly become deeply un-cute.</p><p begin="00:37:11.56" data-timestamp="2231.56">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN You find penguins cute?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:13.70" data-timestamp="2233.7"> What are you talking about? Everyone finds penguins cute.</p><p begin="00:37:16.37" data-timestamp="2236.37">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN I look at them differently now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:18.08" data-timestamp="2238.08"> It would be like a teddy bear biting you or something.</p><p begin="00:37:21.16" data-timestamp="2241.16">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN Yeah, teddy bears are actually stuffed animals. But as an expert on penguin behavior, you're right, it is very unusual.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:37:33.67" data-timestamp="2253.67"> What follows turns out to be one of those sprawling stories that takes 45 minutes to tell. So I will choose just a few highlights for you here. There is the run-in with the police. No story like this is complete without the run-in with the police. John is the only one caught. He's questioned. He's taken to jail. He does not tell them his real name. He does not rat out his friends. He tries to act tough with the cops.</p><p begin="00:37:53.58" data-timestamp="2273.58">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN They were all laughing at me and saying, what were you doing? Are you Marlin Perkins or something? And they said, "OK, empty your pockets." Now, I had been smart in a way that I haven't been in a long time. Before we went to the zoo, I decided, somewhat presciently, that it would be a good idea for me to not have any identification with me. So I didn't bring my wallet or my keys or my ID.</p><p begin="00:38:24.90" data-timestamp="2304.9">But I did have an onion in my pocket. Which really kind of stopped everyone for a very long moment. It was the only thing that I had. And they said, "What is that for?" And I said, "To feed the animals?" And they seemed to enjoy that. And I kind of thought that this couldn't go on for much longer. But they decided to put me in a cell for a while.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:39:00.46" data-timestamp="2340.46"> An on and on, you get the idea. What's strikingly fascinating about hearing his wife, Catherine, tell this same story is that after hearing it at least 20 times-- Well, you'll hear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:39:13.61" data-timestamp="2353.61"> They had a good time for a while, and then, at some point, they were in the pig pen. And I don't know, they knew somehow that the police were there. Isn't funny that I am not really sure how this transpired?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:32.06" data-timestamp="2372.06"> Do what animal bit John?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:39:33.74" data-timestamp="2373.74"> A pig.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:35.50" data-timestamp="2375.5"> OK, that's not right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:39:38.18" data-timestamp="2378.18"> You're kidding?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:41.77" data-timestamp="2381.77"> Nope, it's not a pig.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:39:43.28" data-timestamp="2383.28"> I thought he was in the pig pen. And there's this whole thing where he's like, the pig is licking my ear.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:53.40" data-timestamp="2393.4"> Nope. Not the pig.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:39:55.19" data-timestamp="2395.19"> Was the pig licking Charles's ear?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:58.25" data-timestamp="2398.25"> You barely have this story. You barely know this story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:40:01.96" data-timestamp="2401.96"> I know. I do barely know this story. Do you think that I barely listen? Maybe I don't listen any more?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:07.69" data-timestamp="2407.69"> The part that she actually does remember every time she tells it is the part where he's in jail. She says it brings out some sort of maternal feeling in her. She just can't stand the thought of him going through that. What they're both clear on is why this is the story that John has told over and over for more than a decade. Here is John explaining.</p><p begin="00:40:23.66" data-timestamp="2423.66">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN I think that the story, it's a version of myself that seems a little reckless, adventurous, quick-witted, but also ultimately humiliated by my own overreach.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:41.47" data-timestamp="2441.47"> Have you noticed that there's certain people that all the stories they tell, they are triumphant, and then other people, all the stories that they tell about themselves, they are humiliated.</p><p begin="00:40:50.63" data-timestamp="2450.63">(SUBJECT) JOHN HODGMAN See, I think a good drinking story contains both. Both that heroic aspect and that completely de-clothed, humiliated, embarrassed aspect as well.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:07.82" data-timestamp="2467.82"> When I was talking to him about it, I asked him, why is this the story that gets told over and over? And he said, that a really good story like this should be something where the person telling the story both appears as a hero and then as an idiotic fool.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Hodgman</h4><p begin="00:41:22.49" data-timestamp="2482.49"> [LAUGHTER] Well, where's the hero part?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:38.34" data-timestamp="2498.34"> Which brings us to our last couple, Robert and Tamar. They also have a story that gets repeated in their house that has been the source of a small difference in interpretation between them. It's a story they both tell. Though him more than her, you get feeling. They don't tell the story the same way. And we will start with her version of the story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:41:57.03" data-timestamp="2517.03"> The first thing you need to know about this story is that I am totally celebrity blind, just completely. So much of my life with Robert has been wandering around New York and him saying, oh, look you were sitting next to Candice Bergen. And I'd say, no I wasn't. And he's always right, and I'm always wrong. So I'm really pleased one day. I'm out all by myself in the world, and I'm on the East Side, and I'm walking down Madison Avenue. And I see someone, and I know-- me the celebrity blind person-- I know absolutely for sure, for sure that this person across the street is Jackie Kennedy. And not only is it Jackie Kennedy, but she's looking at me. And she has her hand up when I smile at her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:36.00" data-timestamp="2556"> OK, let's stop that right there. Before she gets too far, here is Robert's interpretation of the same event. Their interviews were recorded separately.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:42:44.20" data-timestamp="2564.2"> It's a beautiful, beautiful fall day. And we're walking down Fifth Avenue. The Central Park is on our right. I just picture this very, very precisely. And we're walking along, and Tamar is distracted. She looks over her left shoulder, and she goes [SOUND OF SURPISE]. There I see, across the street, Jackie Onassis, President Kennedy's wife, and she's waving, very modestly, at Tamar.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:13.15" data-timestamp="2593.15"> You've probably noticed the key differences already. He says that they're together. She says that she's alone. He says, next to Central Park. She says, Madison Avenue. But once she spots Jackie O, the stories fly in tandem for a while.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:43:26.04" data-timestamp="2606.04"> She has her hand when I smile at her, and she waves at me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:43:31.08" data-timestamp="2611.08"> And I thought, oh my God. I didn't know that they knew each other, whatever. And I'm looking at Tamar, and Tamar's looking at Jackie Onassis.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:43:37.80" data-timestamp="2617.8"> And I'm so excited. And I wave back sort of tentatively, but beaming, beaming, beaming. And she waves back more so. I then wave back with my whole, whole heart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:43:46.89" data-timestamp="2626.89"> So I'm just staring at this in wonder. And then Jackie raises her hand even more excitedly and starts sort of moving it back and forth and back and forth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:43:57.04" data-timestamp="2637.04"> And I'm waving, and beaming, and I'm so happy and proud.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:44:00.68" data-timestamp="2640.68"> And in that moment, a cab pulls up alongside Jackie Onassis. And what Jackie Onassis had actually been doing is just waving for a cab. And my wife, by mistake, somehow thought that Jackie was waving at her and is feeling really stupid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:44:15.76" data-timestamp="2655.76"> And so I'm really, pretty humiliated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:44:18.63" data-timestamp="2658.63"> As am I.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:44:19.82" data-timestamp="2659.82"> Because many people had been looking at Jackie Kennedy and many people had been looking at me making a fool of myself, waving, waving, waving, waving.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:44:28.75" data-timestamp="2668.75"> And so we laugh about it, and we head downtown.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:32.18" data-timestamp="2672.18"> So we laugh about it, and we head downtown. Now that is where his version of the story ends, a moment of love, a moment of togetherness. Tamar's version of the story continues. In her version, she comes home. Remember, she experienced the whole thing alone in her version. She comes home, and she tells Robert what happened to her. Weeks later, in her version, they are at somebody's house for dinner, and Robert just launches into his version of the story, the version that you just heard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tamar Lewin</h4><p begin="00:44:57.41" data-timestamp="2697.41"> As we leave that house, I say, you know Robert, you weren't there. And he said, "No. But I remember it, I can picture it, I can see it so clearly." And I say, "But you weren't there."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Krulwich</h4><p begin="00:45:08.50" data-timestamp="2708.5"> She says that I wasn't there. Which is astonishing to me.

<h3>Act Three: Reruns At The Back Of The Bus</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:58.63" data-timestamp="2878.63"> Act 3, Reruns At The Back Of The Bus. But we are a nation that keeps re-running for ourselves a certain story about ourselves and about Rosa Parks. Not only ago there was even a small bit of controversy when the movie <i>Barbershop</i> chose to depart from the official fable that we usually tell ourselves. Well, Sarah Vowell has been watching the trend carefully wherever it appears.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:48:19.32" data-timestamp="2899.32"> According to Reuters, on January 20, 2001 in Washington DC, the special guest at the Florida State inaugural ball was introduced by the country singer Larry Gatlin. He said, in France it was Joan of Arc, in the Crimea it was Florence Nightingale, in the deep South there was Rosa Parks, in India there was Mother Teresa, and in Florida there was Katherine Harris. I leave it to my Indian, Crimean, and French colleagues to determine how the Florida Secretary of State is or is not similar to Teresa, Florence, or Saint Joan.</p><p begin="00:49:00.36" data-timestamp="2940.36">As for Rosa Parks, Katherine Harris can get in line. Because people around here can't stop comparing themselves to Parks. To wit, the Mayor of Friendship Heights Maryland has proposed an outdoor smoking ban because, according to the <i>Washington</i> <i>Post</i>, citizens with asthma or other illnesses cannot have full access to areas where smokers are doing their evil deed. The mayor compares this horrific possibility to Rosa Parks being sent to the back of the bus.</p><p begin="00:49:36.39" data-timestamp="2976.39">A California dairy farmer, protesting the government's milk pricing system, poured milk down a drain in front of TV cameras claiming that he had to take a stand just like Rosa Parks had to take a stand. A street performer in Saint Augustine, Florida is challenging a city ordinance that bans him from doing his act on the town's historic Saint George Street. The performers lawyer told the <i>Florida</i> <i>Times-Union,</i> telling these people they can exercise their first amendment rights somewhere other than on Saint George is like telling Rosa Parks that she has to sit in the back of the bus. Which is, coincidentally, also the argument of another Florida lawyer. This one representing adult dancers contesting Tampa's ordinance outlawing lap dancing.</p><p begin="00:50:30.49" data-timestamp="3030.49">I would also like to mention the rocker, marksman, and conservative activist Ted Nugent who, in his autobiography, <i>God</i>, <i>Guns,</i> <i>and</i> <i>Rock</i> <i>and</i> <i>Roll</i>, refers to himself as Rosa Parks with a loud guitar. Which is so inaccurate. Everyone knows he's more like Mary Matalin with a fancy deer rifle.</p><p begin="00:51:00.87" data-timestamp="3060.87">Call me picky, but breathing secondhand smoke, being subject to unfair dairy pricing, and not being able to mime or lap dance, though they are all tragic, tragic injustices, are not quite as bad as the systematic segregation of public transportation based on skin color.</p><p begin="00:51:20.76" data-timestamp="3080.76">And while fighting for your right to lap dance and mime, and breathe just the regular pollution and not the cigarette smokers, is a very fine, very American idea, it is not quite as brave as being a middle-aged black woman in Alabama in 1955 telling a white man she's not giving him her seat despite the fact that the law requires her to do so. And oh, by the way, in the process, she gets arrested. And then sparks the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which is the seed of the Civil Rights Movement as we know it. The Bus Boycotters not only introduced a 26-year-old pastor by the name of Martin Luther King junior into national public life, but after many months of car pools, walking, and court fights against bus segregation, got the separate-but-equal doctrine declared illegal once and for all.</p><p begin="00:52:18.67" data-timestamp="3138.67">It's not just the people on the right, like Katherine Harris and Ted Nugent, who seem especially silly being likened to Parks. I first cringed at this analogy trend at the lefty Ralph Nader's October 2000 campaign rally in Madison Square Garden. Ever sit in a coliseum full of people who think they're heroes? I was surrounded by thousands of well meaning well fed white kids who loved it when the filmmaker Michael Moore told them they should, like Rosa Parks, stand up to power.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Moore</h4><p begin="00:52:52.18" data-timestamp="3172.18">: What if Rosa Parks had said to herself, I'm the only person on this bus, I can't win? I'm afraid.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:52:59.30" data-timestamp="3179.3"> By which I think he meant, vote for Nader so he could qualify for federal matching funds. I think I'm a fine enough person. By the very next morning I was having people over for waffles. But I hope I'm not being falsely modest by pointing out that I'm no Harriet Tubman and I'm certainly no Rosa Parks. As far as I'm concerned, about the only person in recent memory who has an unimpeachable right to compare himself to Parks is that Chinese student who stared down those tanks in Tiananmen Square.</p><p begin="00:53:38.96" data-timestamp="3218.96">I was reminded of those Naderites watching a rerun of the sitcom <i>Sports</i> <i>Night</i> on <i>Comedy</i> <i>Central</i>. Dan, a television sportscaster played by Josh Charles, has been ordered by his network to make an on-air apology to viewers because he said in a magazine interview that he supports the legalization of marijuana. He stands by his opinion and balks at apologizing. His boss, Isaac, played by Robert Guillaume, agrees but tells him to do it anyway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Guillaume In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:09.35" data-timestamp="3249.35"> Because this is television and this is how it's done.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh Charles In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:12.64" data-timestamp="3252.64"> Yeah, well, sitting in the back of the bus was how it was done until a 42-year-old lady moved up front. I'm not very impressed with how things are done, Isaac.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:54:18.78" data-timestamp="3258.78"> A few minutes later Isaac looks Dan in the eye and tells him--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Guillaume In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:22.92" data-timestamp="3262.92"> Danny, you know I love you, don't you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh Charles In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:27.46" data-timestamp="3267.46"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Guillaume In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:28.31" data-timestamp="3268.31"> And because I love you, I can say this. No rich young white guy has ever gotten anywhere with me comparing himself to Rosa Parks. Got it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh Charles In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:40.96" data-timestamp="3280.96"> Yes, sir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Guillaume In Sports Night</h4><p begin="00:54:42.19" data-timestamp="3282.19"> Good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:54:44.31" data-timestamp="3284.31"> Finally, the voice of reason. Which, of course, was heard on a canceled network TV series airing on cable. Analogies give order to the world and solidarity. Pointing out how one person is like another is reassuring, less lonely. Maybe those who would compare their personal inconveniences to the epic struggles of history are just looking for company. And who wouldn't want to be in the company of Rosa Parks. On the other hand, perhaps people who compare themselves to Rosa Parks are simply arrogant, pampered nincompoops with delusions of grandeur who couldn't tell the difference between a paper cut and decapitation.</p><p begin="00:55:36.63" data-timestamp="3336.63">In defense of Ted Nugent, the street performer, the mayor, the dairy farmer, the lap dancers, the Naderites, and a fictional sportscaster, I will point out that Katherine Harris is the only person on my list of people lamely compared to a civil rights icon who, at the very moment she was being compared to a civil rights icon, was actually being sued for massive voter disenfranchisement of people of color during the presidential election by the NAACP.</p><p begin="00:56:10.27" data-timestamp="3370.27">[MUSIC - "ROSA PARKS" BY OUTKAST]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:20.70" data-timestamp="3380.7"> Sarah Vowell is the author of the book, <i>The Partly</i> <i>Cloudy</i> <i>Patriot</i>, where her thoughts about Rosa Parks appear.</p></div> </div>
