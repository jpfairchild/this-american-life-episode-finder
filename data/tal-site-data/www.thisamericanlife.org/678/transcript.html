You know, there are like 50,000 Democratic candidates running for president. They're all in Iowa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:09.63" data-timestamp="9.63"> It's what? It's 25 right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:00:11.33" data-timestamp="11.33"> It's 25 right now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:12.32" data-timestamp="12.32"> Mm-hm.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:00:12.92" data-timestamp="12.92"> And there's this one political writer, Dave Weigel with the <i>Washington</i> <i>Post,</i> he writes this newsletter thing called <i>The</i> <i>Trailer</i> three times a week. And he has this particular superpower where somehow, he seems to be with every single candidate who's running at the exact same time.</p><p begin="00:00:29.40" data-timestamp="29.4">So at this moment, where everything seems like this grand 25 ring circus with this race, he seemed like maybe the very best person in the world to watch this with. When there's the next president, he'll have seen every moment, not skipping anything. Hopefully, he will understand why it happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:47.82" data-timestamp="47.82"> And so you basically wanted to see the whole election all at once the way he does.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:00:51.59" data-timestamp="51.59"> Yeah. And it's so crazy traveling through primary states with him. He knows these places so well. In Iowa, we pulled up to a gas station.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:00:59.96" data-timestamp="59.96"> If I had to rank Iowa gas stations, I think QuikTrip, then Kum &amp; Go, then Casey's.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:01:09.50" data-timestamp="69.5"> Wait. So what's so great about QuikTrip?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:01:15.55" data-timestamp="75.55"> The current ones, the fairly new ones-- there are some that have been there for a while. But the new ones, I think it might have high quality lids that are like high quality plastic, as opposed to the thing that just breaks--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:01:30.52" data-timestamp="90.52"> Lids?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:01:30.84" data-timestamp="90.84"> --after one use. Yeah, lids. And keep in mind. This is the only taste I'm going to have for a few hours, and I need the caffeine. So I've put thought into it. And I have colleagues who are--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:01:41.64" data-timestamp="101.64"> We were leaving a Hickenlooper event and racing over to a Beto event.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:45.81" data-timestamp="105.81"> Beto is a former Texas senatorial candidate, Beto O'Rourke. Hickenlooper, John Hickenlooper, former Colorado governor-- it took me so long to read up on all these guys. It took like a day to figure out who's who. Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:01:58.92" data-timestamp="118.92"> Thank you for that. We flew in. We went to four things in a day. First, Knoxville, Iowa. Weigel looks kind of like a reporter from the '70s-- mustached, notably, casually dressed, hair askew. We're going to this tiny event at this tiny brewpub. And as we're driving up to it, we think we see the candidate standing right outside.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:02:20.63" data-timestamp="140.63"> It does look like Beto. You're right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:02:22.74" data-timestamp="142.74"> That guy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:02:23.29" data-timestamp="143.29"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:02:23.79" data-timestamp="143.79"> I think it's him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:02:25.24" data-timestamp="145.24"> He's fairly tall. Huh. That's the outfit, the chinos and everything. That is him. Isn't it surreal? Just like when you're walking through a small town, you're like, oh, that guy running for president. Yeah, all right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:02:44.69" data-timestamp="164.69"> I don't know why it's surreal to him. This happens to him literally all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:02:50.25" data-timestamp="170.25"> I think he's waiting to be introduced. Oh, Amy. That's his wife, who's with him today-- the one woman in the--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:02:57.12" data-timestamp="177.12"> In that group?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:02:57.74" data-timestamp="177.74"> Yeah. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:04.33" data-timestamp="184.33"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:03:05.10" data-timestamp="185.1"> I don't know. Just, it's fun living through things like this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:08.51" data-timestamp="188.51"> Oh, he's really into it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:10.65" data-timestamp="190.65"> It thrills him. He loves this. There's this one moment after Beto finishes his little talk, and people come up to him and ask questions. And this guy-- it's in this tiny brewery, which kind of looks like a rec room, almost. And this one voter walks up to Beto with a beer in his hand, just like as though he's at some kind of relaxed Friday afternoon cocktail party. And Weigel sees this, and jumps up and kind of elbows people out of the way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:03:40.57" data-timestamp="220.57"> Sorry, I'm just trying to get a picture of the guy holding the beer while talking to him, just because it amuses me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:44.66" data-timestamp="224.66"> Oh. Yeah, sure.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:03:45.76" data-timestamp="225.76"> It kind of exemplifies the special part we're in, in the election. There's no Secret Service. There are no real barriers. Anyone can just wander up to a presidential candidate. It's extremely intimate. It's his favorite time of the presidential elections. People are really close to each other. At one point at another event, two of the candidates, Tim Ryan and Jay Inslee, they ran right past each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:04:10.11" data-timestamp="250.11"> You're back in the district.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:04:11.51" data-timestamp="251.51"> Go get them, Congressman Ryan!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:04:12.54" data-timestamp="252.54"> You did a great job, Governor! I love your speech!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:04:15.01" data-timestamp="255.01"> You're awesome!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:04:16.33" data-timestamp="256.33"> Do it again! I want to hear it one more time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:19.80" data-timestamp="259.8"> It's almost like Weigel and the candidates are on some kind of a cruise or at a camp together. And they just bump into each other day after day, like, oh, hi again. Oh, I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, I'll see you later. Are you going to be at the pizza thing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:04:32.76" data-timestamp="272.76"> Thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:04:33.16" data-timestamp="273.16"> Thanks a lot. Good to see you again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:04:34.42" data-timestamp="274.42"> Yeah. Good to see you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:04:34.89" data-timestamp="274.89"> See you at the-- I will not catch up with you in the run. But I'll--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:04:37.26" data-timestamp="277.26"> Are you going to run it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:38.07" data-timestamp="278.07"> You also, in this phase of things, you get to see the candidates interacting in the world, the regular world.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.55" data-timestamp="284.55"> Right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:44.88" data-timestamp="284.88"> Regular people with just the most random stuff that you wouldn't normally see.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:48.87" data-timestamp="288.87"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:49.56" data-timestamp="289.56"> I had this thing happened to me. I was checking into our hotel in Waterloo, Iowa, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:54.75" data-timestamp="294.75"> What kind of hotel?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:55.80" data-timestamp="295.8"> Hampton Inn.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:56.50" data-timestamp="296.5"> OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:04:56.97" data-timestamp="296.97"> And the girl who's checking us in, who's like 20-ish maybe-- she seems funny and smiley. And she's really surprised to see these reporters there. And it turns out she's never heard of the Iowa caucuses. Even though the state is crawling with these candidates, it's totally possible to lead your life and miss it. So Weigel explains it to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:05:16.65" data-timestamp="316.65"> Yeah, instead of a presidential primary here--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:05:18.84" data-timestamp="318.84"> All these presidential candidates for the nation to vote, blah, blah, blah. We go upstairs. But my key is demagnetized, so I go back downstairs. I leave all my stuff, including the recorder, there. And when I get downstairs, I see Beto just standing there. And he's trying to get a free bottle of water from the girl. And I'm like, Beto?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:42.89" data-timestamp="342.89"> Wait, do you know him?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:05:44.04" data-timestamp="344.04"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:44.52" data-timestamp="344.52"> You've never met him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:05:45.12" data-timestamp="345.12"> No. And I say to him, Beto, tell her what you're doing here in Iowa. And she looks at him, and she goes, are you running for president, in this totally sarcastic way. Like of course you're not. And he goes, actually, yes, I am, which is just a weird answer to that question. And she jumps up, goes, yes, queen! And he's like totally taken aback and is like, thank you so much. And she goes, I hope you win the presidency-- like not very sincere.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:29.89" data-timestamp="389.89"> And so this is just the world that Weigel was marinating in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:06:32.62" data-timestamp="392.62"> He knows them all so thoroughly at this point. He knows them as thoroughly as he knows the gas stations in Iowa. We were at a bar. He starts talking about the jokes that candidates tell when they're out on [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:06:46.84" data-timestamp="406.84"> The horrible spouse joke. Whereas, Warren has a riff where she talks about dropping out of school. It's like, fell in love. Woo-hoo. Got married, Woo-hoo. Had a baby. Woo. And she just-- it's like a Simpsons joke, almost. She imitates getting less and less excited about her bad life decisions. She's like, and then I met my first husband. Never a good idea when you have to number them, things like that.</p><p begin="00:07:14.83" data-timestamp="434.83">My favorite Klobuchar joke is, she talks about how she's Slovenian American. And it's like, and for years, I was the most famous Slovenian American in politics. But then Melania Trump arrived, and you know what? It's like looking in a mirror. You laugh. It's like a [INAUDIBLE]. But Biden does the, my wife is always right joke. Who else does that? People mostly learn to not do that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:41.36" data-timestamp="461.36"> For today on our program, we're in this unusual political moment. The Democrats have even more people running for president than the Republicans did last time. 25 people-- what is that?</p><p begin="00:07:52.81" data-timestamp="472.81">Today in our show, we are not going to cover all 25. What we're going to do is we're going to drop in here and there. My sense is that, at this point, everyone is still getting to know who these people are. And so hopefully, you will get in close with some of them and get an impression of them.</p><p begin="00:08:06.47" data-timestamp="486.47">And what we're especially interested in in this show is all of the candidates at the bottom. That's the story of this particular moment in the election, is all those people between 0% and 1% in the polls who might still have a chance trying to get noticed and break out of the pack, and join the front runners, which is just an enormously difficult thing to do. And it's just right now starting to shift. How do you get noticed and rise above 1% in this pack of 25? From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.

<h3>Act One: Wannabes One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:50.15" data-timestamp="530.15"> Act 1.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:08:50.47" data-timestamp="530.47"> No. No acts today. Let's just drive around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:53.46" data-timestamp="533.46"> So bossy. All right, ma'am. So Zoe, so 25 candidates-- and this political operative explained this to me, and I found it a helpful way to look at this. He said that the best way to picture what is happening right now is that there are four front runners-- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris. And then depending on how you count it, Pete Buttigieg is in there, too.</p><p begin="00:09:13.59" data-timestamp="553.59">Their poll numbers are way higher than anybody else. And also, they get most of the donations and most of the press attention, which then generates more donations and more press attention in a kind of self-perpetuating cycle that sucks the air out that all the others want to breathe.</p><p begin="00:09:28.14" data-timestamp="568.14">So that's them. And then below those four or five people, there's basically everyone else in the pack of 25, most of them struggling to break 1%. And it seems just very interesting what is happening with them. And so, Zoe, you watched them trying to figure that out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:09:43.02" data-timestamp="583.02"> OK. So for example, take John Hickenlooper.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:46.83" data-timestamp="586.83"> Former governor of Colorado.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:09:48.97" data-timestamp="588.97"> His polling is now at less than 1%. If you haven't heard of him, that's probably why. He cannot draw a crowd by himself. If he put out a sign in Iowa today, Hickenlooper Speaks, Please RSVP, probably nobody would come to that event.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:02.81" data-timestamp="602.81"> Crickets, right? Yeah. OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:10:04.08" data-timestamp="604.08"> Yeah. So he does these-- they're called retail stops, when a politician tours a factory or whatever. So right now, we're at this brand new distillery in Des Moines, me and Dave Weigel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:10:16.23" data-timestamp="616.23"> --because this stuff is actually kind of fun to watch.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:10:19.61" data-timestamp="619.61"> And we walk in. Hickenlooper and this one elderly Iowa voter are sitting at the bar, the brand new bar in the brand new distillery. It's a totally staged photo op. There are about 20 reporters in a semicircle around them. But obviously, if you look through the camera lens, it looks like it's just Hickenlooper and the voter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Hickenlooper</h4><p begin="00:10:38.07" data-timestamp="638.07"> What a pleasure. I can't tell you. This is an absolute honor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:10:42.14" data-timestamp="642.14"> You're running for what?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:10:43.38" data-timestamp="643.38"> The old guy's like, you're running for what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Hickenlooper</h4><p begin="00:10:45.51" data-timestamp="645.51"> The highest office of the land-- President of the United States.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:10:47.32" data-timestamp="647.32"> Oh, really? OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Hickenlooper</h4><p begin="00:10:49.14" data-timestamp="649.14"> So I was an entrepreneur. I built brew pubs all over the-- mostly over the Midwest. But I built the biggest brew pub in the country, and Denver was my first one. Always in abandoned warehouses. I won the Award of Honor from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. I don't know what that's good for.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:03.84" data-timestamp="663.84"> It's so strange that these guys actually-- they do have to kind of just brag about themselves to people, huh?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:09.59" data-timestamp="669.59"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:09.83" data-timestamp="669.83"> Like people don't know who they are. I mean, not to be mean about it, but people [INAUDIBLE] don't know who they are. So they just have to say, here's all the stuff I've done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:17.31" data-timestamp="677.31"> Even he gets kind of self-conscious about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Hickenlooper</h4><p begin="00:11:19.59" data-timestamp="679.59"> I call it the fundamental nonsense of Washington, or place of common sense. That's my shtick. But anyway--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:25.77" data-timestamp="685.77"> That's my shtick?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:26.70" data-timestamp="686.7"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:27.83" data-timestamp="687.83"> Oh, I like that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:11:29.13" data-timestamp="689.13"> Good luck.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:30.00" data-timestamp="690"> Good luck, the old guy says to him. 20 people are recording this, and no one is going to use any of this. No one's going to use these quotes, right? We move on to a distillery tour. Hickenlooper has tons of opinions about that. Remember, he was in this business.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Hickenlooper</h4><p begin="00:11:45.57" data-timestamp="705.57"> I always call it the Haagen-Dazs effect, which is--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:11:48.27" data-timestamp="708.27"> No one is going to use any of this either. Instead, the reporters just wait til the end. They gather around, they ask him questions about Trump. That stuff, they might use.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:57.55" data-timestamp="717.55"> So this whole thing, this whole tour, all of it is just for pictures.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:12:00.27" data-timestamp="720.27"> Yeah. What the campaign hopes for is that, out of the 25 candidates, tonight viewers will see a picture somewhere of John Hickenlooper drinking a beer in Iowa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:09.00" data-timestamp="729"> I don't see how that's going to make him president. That is not going to be enough to take him out of the 1% and put him up there with the front runners.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:12:17.43" data-timestamp="737.43"> Iowa, though-- voter by voter. These 1%-ers, they're also going around Iowa talking, and talking, and talking to the actual voters, the real human beings who go to the caucuses and vote. And in order to do that, the candidates who can't draw a crowd on their own, one thing those guys do is go to local Democratic clubs. The idea is you do these Democratic clubs for a while, county Democratic clubs, and then you get popular enough to graduate out and draw a crowd on your own.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:44.58" data-timestamp="764.58"> Ah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:12:45.42" data-timestamp="765.42"> Like Pete Buttigieg, he had to do the Democratic clubs for about a month. He went around introducing himself, and then he graduated out. Now he can draw a crowd on his own. Most of them have not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:12:56.06" data-timestamp="776.06"> I remember-- there's a Delaney bumper sticker. They're real.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:00.15" data-timestamp="780.15"> Whoa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:13:00.63" data-timestamp="780.63"> There was one that was--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:02.13" data-timestamp="782.13"> What if that's Delaney's car, though?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:13:03.77" data-timestamp="783.77"> It could be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:04.59" data-timestamp="784.59"> John Delaney, also at less than 1%, rich guy and former congressman from Maryland. He's doing a meet-and-greet with the Clive County Democrats at Wobbly Boots Barbecue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Delaney</h4><p begin="00:13:15.87" data-timestamp="795.87"> So I'm sure this is going to surprise you. I actually believe I have the best [INAUDIBLE].</p><p begin="00:13:20.81" data-timestamp="800.81">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:13:23.03" data-timestamp="803.03">But I think what makes it best is it's different, and I can get it done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:28.89" data-timestamp="808.89"> Delaney's moderate. He's not into Medicare for All. He's not into the Green New Deal. Even his climate change plan is all wrapped up in red, white, and blue bunting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Delaney</h4><p begin="00:13:38.07" data-timestamp="818.07"> Because we're solving the problem the old-fashioned American way by inventing and building.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:13:44.20" data-timestamp="824.2"> Hear hear!</p><p begin="00:13:45.14" data-timestamp="825.14">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:46.56" data-timestamp="826.56"> The room is packed, actually. People here are eating John Delaney up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:50.34" data-timestamp="830.34"> So it's working.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:13:51.52" data-timestamp="831.52"> Yeah. I came to see exactly this, one of these 1%-ers winning people over to their side. And Delaney is betting his chips on Iowa. He's got eight offices there. That's more than anyone else, as of a couple weeks ago, anyway. He's been there the most times.</p><p begin="00:14:07.71" data-timestamp="847.71">We ran into him in the airport on the way there. It was his 29th trip. He's doing the purist version of this play on the campaign trail, a Jimmy Carter play. It's basically get a huge surge by doing great in the Iowa caucuses, the first in the nation. And the way you do that is voter by voter. That's what he's doing out here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:14:27.53" data-timestamp="867.53"> That's what Carter did. Carter was the first candidate who ever did that. They didn't have a caucus before, or they didn't have a caucus people paid attention to before. He lived here. Came in famously second to uncommitted. It was like uncommitted, 30, Carter, 25 or something. And people were like, oh, he beat all the much more famous senators. Who is this guy? So that was more than 40 years ago. But it's still like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:14:52.09" data-timestamp="892.09"> So everybody's doing this Carter play. That's how you could think about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dave Weigel</h4><p begin="00:14:55.32" data-timestamp="895.32"> A lot of them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:14:56.55" data-timestamp="896.55"> I talked to one voter. He liked this meeting so much, he said he might caucus for Delaney. He might. He's still shopping around. But the number of people shopping has dropped since the first debate. And the window's closing for the 1%-ers.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Two: Wannabes Two</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:10.89" data-timestamp="910.89"> The debates-- they are probably the biggest chance that any of these underdogs get to rise out of the underdog pack and come barking to the forefront.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:19.72" data-timestamp="919.72"> The next one's at the end of the month. There has been one so far, of course.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:23.01" data-timestamp="923.01"> And two days before the first debate, the team for one of the candidates, as you know, Zoe, let me watch a full day of debate prep. And by sheer luck, it was the candidate that most of the media declared the breakout star of the first night of the debate, Juli&#225;n Castro. Zoe, you ready to hear the story?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Zoe Chace</h4><p begin="00:15:39.77" data-timestamp="939.77"> Obviously.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:40.81" data-timestamp="940.81"> OK. Here is the team that got him to victory.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:44.88" data-timestamp="944.88"> OK, so the three of you, have you ever done debate prep before?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Maya Rupert</h4><p begin="00:15:48.57" data-timestamp="948.57"> Nope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jen Fiore</h4><p begin="00:15:49.12" data-timestamp="949.12"> No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sawyer Hackett</h4><p begin="00:15:49.78" data-timestamp="949.78"> No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:50.63" data-timestamp="950.63"> Meet Maya Rupert, Jen Fiore, and Sawyer Hackett, the campaign manager, communications advisor, and national press secretary for Juli&#225;n Castro. Castro was mayor of San Antonio, then ran the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama. They all worked for Castro there. If you add it up, they had done three full days of debate prep before this one, the one that I saw. And they were going to do one more after that. That is how important this is to them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Eadon</h4><p begin="00:16:15.61" data-timestamp="975.61"> All right, so this is what we've got on the agenda for this morning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:18.88" data-timestamp="978.88"> We're in a hotel conference room in Miami. All over the walls are these big pages torn from flip charts, each with a different topic and then three or four possible talking points for the candidate to use in the debate that they worked out in previous sessions. The guy talking is deputy campaign manager, Derek Eadon, who is running these sessions. And he's up in front by the easel with the flip chart.</p><p begin="00:16:38.66" data-timestamp="998.66">And the candidate is standing at one of five podiums in front of the room. He's in jeans and a white dress shirt, sleeves rolled up, immaculately clean, white Adidas, iced tea, which, by the way, he told the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> is his comfort food on the road.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Eadon</h4><p begin="00:16:53.52" data-timestamp="1013.52"> And then we want to talk through a little bit of closing statement.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:56.29" data-timestamp="1016.29"> Castro's staff, I should say, is deeply aware that most voters still do not know who Juli&#225;n Castro is. And they told me that success in the first debate, to them, would be something very basic-- that voters would notice Castro, that he's in the race. Here's Jen Fiore, his senior communications advisor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jen Fiore</h4><p begin="00:17:15.18" data-timestamp="1035.18"> Maybe it changes their math, right? Maybe they were supporting one person. They thought, oh, but wait. But wait. I heard a lot of interesting stuff from Juli&#225;n Castro, and I've got to shift my math.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:27.01" data-timestamp="1047.01"> One of the flip charts on the wall was, "Top Five Takeaways," meaning the top five things that they want voters to take away from this debate. They read, "I like him," "he won," "game changer," "can handle his own," and "win/beat Trump."</p><p begin="00:17:44.04" data-timestamp="1064.04">So OK. How do you get voters to change the math? If you think about it, the debate means 10 candidates standing on stage for 120 minutes, two hours. So that's 10 minutes per candidate. But you take away commercial breaks and questions. What it leaves, the average talking time for each candidate is actually eight minutes-- eight minutes to implant yourselves into the brains of millions of people. Eight minutes-- though that is just the average. Not everybody gets that much, which is actually the thing that Castro is most afraid of going into the debate. He says they've studied these moderators.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:18:16.72" data-timestamp="1096.72"> And they don't have a track record of actually enforcing time very well. So you've got to be mindful. OK, if they're going to let people go, the worst case scenario is not that I am flat, it's that I don't get any time, whatsoever. Because people got into a skirmish, and other people butted in. And all of a sudden, the time's gone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:35.00" data-timestamp="1115"> Some candidates just end up getting five minutes. So you have limited time, and you have no idea what they're going to ask you about. And so you have to prepare perfect, pithy answers for every imaginable question. And what perfect means-- Juli&#225;n's staff wants him to work three specific elements into each of those answers if he can.</p><p begin="00:18:54.77" data-timestamp="1134.77">They want some of his personal story-- raised by a single mother, working class neighborhood, that kind of thing. They want him to talk about the stuff that he has done in previous jobs in government-- prove that he's capable. And of course, they want him to talk about what he's going to do next if he gets the job of president. All three things in each answer. So for instance, when they're hammering out an answer about climate and the Green New Deal, Castro, he starts pitching policy ideas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:19:19.61" data-timestamp="1159.61"> I think here, we want to stress-- we're going to lead on combating climate change, get to net zero, create jobs in the new energy--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:29.09" data-timestamp="1169.09"> Then Jen jumps in. Talk more about your experience.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jen Fiore</h4><p begin="00:19:31.85" data-timestamp="1171.85"> Right, but not a lot of an impact. Maybe nobody on the stage, other than maybe Governor Inslee, has actually done the work to help people recover the way that you have, right, as HUD secretary. I remember the trip that you took to Louisiana after that horrendous flood, and--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:19:46.16" data-timestamp="1186.16"> Talk about what you've done on climate change, she urges him, which he then incorporates into his next run-through of the answer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:19:52.64" data-timestamp="1192.64"> As Housing Secretary, I worked to make sure that communities could rebuild from natural disasters in a more sustainable way.

And can I just say, respect for anybody who can make a joke about Moulton, Ryan, or Inslee? None of these jokes are going to make the cut, Castro's staff tells me later. Those kinds of jokes just aren't Castro's style. The one joke they could imagine the candidate actually telling onstage at the debate-- I have to say, it really surprised me-- the one about how he's kind of short.</p><p begin="00:24:13.57" data-timestamp="1453.57">Of course, the other thing that Juli&#225;n has to practice is reacting to all the other candidates and the moderators. They study videos of his opponents, and they do this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Millie</h4><p begin="00:24:23.02" data-timestamp="1463.02"> Hello, and welcome to sunny Miami, Florida, for the first Democratic debate of the 2020 presidential cycle.

Sawyer and a staffer named Millie play the moderators. Four other staffers stand at podiums flanking Castro's. The men are now in ties and jackets. They want to give Castro the chance to run his answers under debate conditions where he's going to have to wait for his opponents to speak, where he might have to field answers that kind of poke at him.</p><p begin="00:24:48.56" data-timestamp="1488.56">And I have to say, it was totally charming and fascinating how accurate they tried to be at playing the other candidates in the debate. Out on the road, they've watched these politicians deliver the same lines again and again. So when Derek, who is playing Cory Booker, gets a question about gun violence, he has Booker's lines down cold.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Eadon</h4><p begin="00:25:08.53" data-timestamp="1508.53"> I've been waking up in the middle of the night hearing gunshot.

There's many ways to connect it. For example, Amy and I are still living in El Paso. I've grown up my entire life there. And so I know the unique challenges that our border community faces.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:43.21" data-timestamp="1543.21"> In the mock debate, Castro does a relaxed, solid job deploying the answers that he's been working on. But he also gets to practice interrupting other candidates. And this is important because, again, he is worried that other candidates might hog the stage, and he won't get much time or many questions directed at him. And Castro told me that his natural inclination is not to interrupt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:26:02.23" data-timestamp="1562.23"> I mean, for me, I'm not naturally the guy in a group that has to talk all the time, like they would call gunners in law school. You know gunners? People that would, in law school classes, that basically would be the ones always trying to answer the question that a professor would throw out. That's not me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:22.93" data-timestamp="1582.93"> I don't know if that's spin or not. But to make sure he does get to talk in the debate, he's keeping in his back pocket two little speeches that he knows are really strong, that if needs be, he's going to bust in and interrupt somebody with. They're actually listed. These two speeches are listed on a flip chart page on the wall that is titled "Interruptions." One of them is listed as "Police Brutality." And in the mock debate, he practices jumping in on another candidate's answer, the guy playing de Blasio, to deliver this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Staffer</h4><p begin="00:26:50.83" data-timestamp="1610.83"> I've been able to deal with this as an executive of America's biggest city.

And I've been an executive, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:01.37" data-timestamp="1621.37"> And then Castro delivers an answer that he knows really works.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:27:04.06" data-timestamp="1624.06"> But it made me think, what about Eric Garner? And what about Tamir Rice? And what about Michael Brown? What about Laquan McDonald?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:11.03" data-timestamp="1631.03"> At the real debate, Castro delivered a version of that same speech. But that was not the moment that made him the breakout star. There was also not any of the meticulously crafted three-part messages that I watched him labor over.</p><p begin="00:27:24.70" data-timestamp="1644.7">And OK, just to step back, if you saw the Democratic debate, you know that the big clip from the second night was Kamala Harris challenging Joe Biden on race. But the big clip from the first night was the other item on Castro's flip chart, list of interruptions. On the chart, it just said "1325 Immigration."</p><p begin="00:27:42.24" data-timestamp="1662.24">Now 1325, if you're not following this, is the part of the immigration law that makes crossing the border a criminal offense. Castro wants to get rid of that. It would still be illegal to cross the border, but you wouldn't face criminal charges. And the day after I watched him prep, Elizabeth Warren came out in the <i>Huffington</i> <i>Post</i> saying, yeah, I'm with Castro on this 1325 stuff.</p><p begin="00:28:05.21" data-timestamp="1685.21">So that was the day before the debate. And seeing that, Castro and his staff to talk about maybe they should do more with 1325 in the debate. And they talked in the past about Castro maybe challenging the other candidates on stage to join his position on 1325, but now they decided, yeah, it's not really a maybe. He really should try to make that happen. And Castro walked on stage looking for an opening, which he got about half an hour in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cory Booker</h4><p begin="00:28:30.01" data-timestamp="1710.01"> I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:33.82" data-timestamp="1713.82"> Cory Booker is answering a question about immigration.

Google reported a leap in people searching for Castro's name. And it led the campaign to its biggest fundraising day ever, 32 times more than just before the debate. Castro was suddenly invited to be on <i>Morning</i> <i>Joe</i> and tons of other TV shows. The only thing that had not gone optimally was his exit from the stage at the end of the debate. Derek had advised him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Eadon</h4><p begin="00:30:42.51" data-timestamp="1842.51"> I would suggest go talk to Elizabeth Warren as quickly as possible.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:30:45.93" data-timestamp="1845.93"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Eadon</h4><p begin="00:30:46.32" data-timestamp="1846.32"> Like the dynamic--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julian Castro</h4><p begin="00:30:47.04" data-timestamp="1847.04"> Oh, you mean because you know that the focus is [INAUDIBLE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Eadon</h4><p begin="00:30:49.00" data-timestamp="1849"> The dynamic of you, Booker, and Warren genuinely liking each other will be something that will be good for the [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:55.84" data-timestamp="1855.84"> In fact, at the debate's end, Cory Booker is the one who got to Warren first, and they hugged, while Castro was shaking Tim Ryan's hand. And then Warren walked over to Castro, and they embraced. So it worked out in the end even there, just fine. Overall, a win.</p><p begin="00:31:12.00" data-timestamp="1872">And a week after his breakaway performance in that first debate, Castro was no longer a 1%-er, at least in one poll.

He's been doing things like getting on cable shows, profiles in <i>Vanity</i> <i>Fair,</i> <i>Washington</i> <i>Post.</i> And so now he's in this position where he's just trying to fan like whatever little flames he's kindled up until this point.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:37.35" data-timestamp="2317.35"> And he's gotten that attention because, well, if you know who this guy is, he's this tech guy, former businessman, who organized his whole campaign around this one idea.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:38:46.59" data-timestamp="2326.59"> Yeah, and the idea is that we should give every working age American $1,000 a month. Because what Yang says is he says this whole country is in this big crisis where workers are being replaced by automation and technology. And he thinks that when Democrats usually talk about this, their solutions are weak sauce. He says job retraining programs--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:08.22" data-timestamp="2348.22"> The Democrats talk about that a lot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:39:09.84" data-timestamp="2349.84"> Yeah, job retraining.

And most people kind of feel that in their gut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Yang</h4><p begin="00:39:18.27" data-timestamp="2358.27"> Because it is bull [BLEEP]. And national politicians will talk about retraining until they're blue in the face. They love it, [LAUGHS] because they're far from the group of people that are getting displaced. But if you get close-- I was at a truck stop here in Iowa, Iowa 80. And you walk around there, talking about retraining to those guys, you'll probably get a fist to the face. [LAUGHS] It's irresponsible to talk about that as a mass solution.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:39:47.64" data-timestamp="2387.64"> So $1,000 a month, which Yang admits, it's not enough for somebody to live on, but he says it's enough to keep somebody afloat. The name for that is Universal Basic Income, UBI. Yang's calling his version of this the Freedom Dividend. But so I went to go see him. He's going to demonstrate how this would work by actually giving somebody $1,000 a month, no strings attached.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:11.62" data-timestamp="2411.62"> For a year?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:40:12.54" data-timestamp="2412.54"> A whole year out of his pocket.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:14.86" data-timestamp="2414.86"> OK.

Yang's like, I'm so psyched. But then right away, there's this logistical problem. To give away $1,000, you need to hand people something. And he doesn't have $1,000 on him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Yang</h4><p begin="00:40:46.76" data-timestamp="2446.76"> What they want to do is like-- I've gotta stop by an ATM and--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:40:50.19" data-timestamp="2450.19"> OK, it's pretty much impossible to hear. I'm way in the back. I'm behind Yang's campaign manager, Zach Graumann, and Yang. They're up in front. So I'm just going to tell you how a lot of this dialogue goes.</p><p begin="00:41:03.04" data-timestamp="2463.04">In that tape there, Yang says, I need to stop by an ATM and get a lot of cash, right? Because Ed McMahon doesn't show up at your house and just tell you you've won publisher's clearing house. That would be lame. You take a photo with the big check. So Yang's like, I got to get out a bunch of cash, to which his campaign manager says, well--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Graumann</h4><p begin="00:41:24.08" data-timestamp="2484.08"> So you cannot give cash. We need to think about this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:41:27.83" data-timestamp="2487.83"> "So you cannot give cash. We need to think about this," he says. And he gives this big sigh. Because shockingly, the Federal Elections Commission has a problem with a candidate for president giving a voter $12,000 in cash. Go figure. But also apparently, it's fine if that money comes in the form of a check. Again, go figure. Questions start flying. Does anybody have a check? Hey, what about Don?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Staffer 1</h4><p begin="00:41:53.04" data-timestamp="2513.04"> Don's son would probably have a check, right?

And then he starts asking how much ATM limits are. How about a cashier's check, someone says, at a Walgreens on Sunday morning?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Staffer 1</h4><p begin="00:42:14.21" data-timestamp="2534.21"> Getting to a Walgreens before 9:00 AM tomorrow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Staffer 2</h4><p begin="00:42:16.40" data-timestamp="2536.4"> That's not impossible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:42:17.67" data-timestamp="2537.67"> I'm in a car with a candidate for the presidency of the United States of America who's trying to sell the marquee idea of his campaign, the concept he thinks will save America. And the question of the moment is, can you get a cashier's check at a Walgreens in Des Moines on Sunday morning before 9:00 AM?</p><p begin="00:42:45.63" data-timestamp="2565.63">The next day, we go to the house of the Freedom Dividend recipients, Kyle and Pam Christiansen. At this point, the campaign hasn't told them they're getting the money, just that they're being considered as finalists. Yang isn't with us. He's waiting to make a surprise entrance.</p><p begin="00:43:02.04" data-timestamp="2582.04">His staff was not able to get a cashier's check. So instead, Yang has a grand in $20 bills. That means that, legally, the campaign is going to have to hand the Christiansens the money for this photo op, but then take it back afterwards and promise to mail them a check, which seems really pretty tacky to me. But everyone with the Yang campaign is like, we'll figure it out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Graumann</h4><p begin="00:43:24.45" data-timestamp="2604.45"> Hi.

How are you?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:43:29.19" data-timestamp="2609.19"> The campaign, I've got to say, picked a really lovely family to get this. Kyle, the son, is 41. He'd applied for this Freedom Dividend on behalf of his mom. About four years ago, the family lost Kyle's dad, Merle, to brain cancer. They seemed like such a tight, loving family.</p><p begin="00:43:48.06" data-timestamp="2628.06">Merle was a musician. And in their house, every Wednesday, it was music night. They'd play records-- Kiss, Black Sabbath. Merle would play drums, and the kids would dance around, which is how, I suppose, Kyle ended up being a musician, too.</p><p begin="00:44:02.97" data-timestamp="2642.97">Anyway, about a year after Merle died, Pam was also diagnosed with cancer. The day she was diagnosed-- her birthday-- her boss called her to tell her he was firing her because she'd had to miss too much work. Pam worked as an aide for disabled adults, which she said was hard, but she loved it.</p><p begin="00:44:21.09" data-timestamp="2661.09">After that, Kyle dedicated himself to taking care of Pam. And Pam, now in remission, still has a hard time getting around. Kyle's been piecing together work-- auto repair, computer repair, music work when he can get it. But it's hard making sure he's there for his mom.</p><p begin="00:44:39.93" data-timestamp="2679.93">The monthly bills are about $1,300, and they barely get covered. So $1,000 would mean a lot. Kyle, though, he says he'd like to see his mom spend at least some of this imaginary money, even just a little, on something genuinely frivolous.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kyle Christiansen</h4><p begin="00:44:55.46" data-timestamp="2695.46"> Yeah, I'd just like to see her just go buy something because she wants to and not out of necessity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pam Christiansen</h4><p begin="00:45:01.83" data-timestamp="2701.83"> But there's priorities, too, so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:45:04.36" data-timestamp="2704.36"> Well, what are some of the things that-- I feel like you get sick, those bills pile up, you start to give things up.

Yang genuinely asks Pam and Kyle about their situation-- Pam's neuropathy, her treatment. He talks again and again about how much he admires Kyle for taking care of his mom. Kyle talks about the one doctor's appointment he's missed in the last three years. They talk about music, how Kyle quit the metal band he was touring with because he loved performing, but he never had an interest in the drinking and drugs that went with it. They laugh about Yang's flag socks. He talks about picking them out.</p><p begin="00:48:13.02" data-timestamp="2893.02">Like so little of political campaigning, it's unrushed enough to feel regular. Until it's time to go and the surreal logistics of a political campaign break through this small bubble of normality. Yang has to hit the road.</p><p begin="00:48:28.44" data-timestamp="2908.44">I feel like this is a weird and particular thing you see when politicians campaign. So many of their interactions are superficial and crassly abbreviated. And then sometimes, like in this room, they'll just drift into a space with some voters that feels intense, and authentic, and personal. And then poof, time to go.</p><p begin="00:48:50.04" data-timestamp="2930.04">Before Yang's got to leave, though, they have to pose for pictures. They have to pose with the cash, the cash they need, but won't be allowed to keep. After the pictures, they'll hand it back. For now, Yang pulls out this huge wad of twenties. Pam, with some struggle, stands up. And Yang hands each of them a stack.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Staffer</h4><p begin="00:49:07.97" data-timestamp="2947.97"> Yeah, can you fan it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zach Graumann</h4><p begin="00:49:09.09" data-timestamp="2949.09"> Can you guys fan it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ben Calhoun</h4><p begin="00:49:10.80" data-timestamp="2950.8"> They fan out the money.

At this point, Weigel can sort of divide the candidates into two groups. And it's not the moderates and the far left.

So I think that the field probably is going to limit itself more to 16, 17 people soon.</p><p begin="00:56:43.91" data-timestamp="3403.91">When it comes to me taking people seriously, if at this point you had two fundraising quarters, you're in the teens or the high single digits, and you have enough money to fund 50 staff in Iowa, I think that's more interesting.

Yes, on the Republican side, things are still wide open and away. There, it is just the president and so far, one other candidate, former governor Bill Weld. Weld held elective office 20 years ago.

You can do it quietly, out of view, or you can do it the way Kristol has-- by never shutting up about it on television and newspaper articles. He recently tweeted that he'd been accused of being in a secret cabal to find a challenger to Trump. His answer-- there's nothing secret about it.</p><p begin="00:59:13.01" data-timestamp="3553.01">Kristol and Longwell have raised a few million dollars in the past two years. And they've been using it to try and see, is this thing even possible? The whole idea of running against Trump in the primary can seem a little crazy. He has like an 80% or 90% approval rating from Republicans. But they feel like it is not crazy at all. In that poll they just had done of Republicans in New Hampshire and independents who might vote in the Republican primary, half were open to voting for a challenger. Half.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Longwell</h4><p begin="00:59:40.16" data-timestamp="3580.16"> No, I mean, I was just up in Manchester, and I did a series of focus groups.

I think for some people, there's a hunger for an alternative. And then for other people, it's just an openness, like a willingness for political competition.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:00:02.57" data-timestamp="3602.57"> One thing that really surprises people in these focus groups, she says, is when you explain just how much the debt has gone up under Trump. It's increased more during the first two years of Trump than it did the previous two years under Obama.</p><p begin="01:00:14.04" data-timestamp="3614.04">Bill Kristol lays out how this all might go for a challenger. You raise a little money, go to Iowa, New Hampshire. Maybe you get 30% of the vote in New Hampshire. That is a serious blow to the president. You're off and running. So that's their case.</p><p begin="01:00:28.71" data-timestamp="3628.71">There is one kind of noticeable challenge to this plan. Since we've had the current primary system, there are zero examples-- zero-- of someone challenging a sitting president in a primary and actually winning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:00:42.32" data-timestamp="3642.32"> I mean, is some part of this just kind of like theater? And I mean theater you truly believe in?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:00:48.69" data-timestamp="3648.69"> I mean, I don't want to say yes because of course-- because that really isn't. I don't think of it that way. I'm not a very theatrical person. But I guess theater in the sense that presidential politics is the biggest stage we have in politics. And the presidential contest is the biggest stage. And I don't want to simply leave that stage on the Republican side alone to Donald Trump.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:01:09.75" data-timestamp="3669.75"> I'm still trying to think through just, like in your mind, why you're doing this. And is part of it just like a feeling like what is democracy for, if I can't cast a vote for the person I really want to be in office?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:01:22.36" data-timestamp="3682.36"> Yeah, I think it's actually people are overthinking this. I mean, I'm doing it because I don't think Trump should have a second term. I'm a Republican. It'd be a heck of a thing to say, OK, you think he's really leading the country down a terrible path, and you should just take two or four or six years off.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:01:38.04" data-timestamp="3698.04"> But you're really unlikely to succeed, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:01:40.74" data-timestamp="3700.74"> Pretty unlikely to succeed, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:01:43.09" data-timestamp="3703.09"> So why do it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:01:44.55" data-timestamp="3704.55"> Look. The last three presidents were not primaried, and they won re-election.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:01:48.29" data-timestamp="3708.29"> And here, Bill offered up what seems to be the other math that candidates are doing. The last three presidents did not have a primary challenge, and they won re-election. When a sitting president has been challenged by his own party, like Carter by Kennedy, Ford by Reagan, Bush by Buchanan, the challenger doesn't win. But maybe because they damaged the president, he does not win re-election. In other words, this may be the bargain. You can run for president, possibly shape history, end Trump, change who wins, but you don't get to win.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:02:23.87" data-timestamp="3743.87"> I mean, it's interesting. The other Republicans I talked to pointed out that history is not on your side. And you were pointing out, oh, it is on my side, in the sense that a sitting president challenged tends to lose. But that means what you're doing is just an act of internal sabotage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:02:39.10" data-timestamp="3759.1"> No, but I think it's also holding out an alternative in a good way. But yeah--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:02:43.16" data-timestamp="3763.16"> Or sabotage. I mean--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:02:44.35" data-timestamp="3764.35"> Well, people can say that. They said that about the French who didn't go along with Vichy. I mean, what are you supposed to do? If you think it's bad--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:02:50.13" data-timestamp="3770.13"> I love that every time I have a point that's historical--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:02:52.03" data-timestamp="3772.03"> If you think it's bad for the country, they can say it's sabotage. I would say it's opposition. I don't think it's sabotage. Sabotage implies secrecy and deception. I don't think there's a heck of a lot of secrecy and deception in what I'm doing. I think I've been pretty open about my opposition, so I feel like I'm-- isn't that the point of America?</p><p begin="01:03:14.38" data-timestamp="3794.38">Honestly, if I were a Democrat, I would call me up and say, here's a lot of money for a primary challenge-- and we have talked to a lot of Democrats about this, obviously-- against Donald Trump. I mean, that's actually the single best thing you can do to weaken Trump. You can help Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris, or Cory Booker right now. But we don't know which of those will actually be a good nominee against Trump. The one thing you do know is if Trump has to spend money against the primary challenger, if he loses 32% of the vote in New Hampshire, which is entirely possible, and it's embarrassing, it would be helpful to weaken Trump.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:03:49.43" data-timestamp="3829.43"> Wait, but is your goal to run somebody who's going to win the nomination and maybe the presidency? Or is your goal just to take down Trump?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Kristol</h4><p begin="01:03:56.89" data-timestamp="3836.89"> Both. Obviously, the first would be the best. But I would regard the second as an adequate result, and I think actually an important result, if I can say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:04:06.43" data-timestamp="3846.43"> Sarah Longwell has been weighing all this, too. It's possible the whole thing could backfire if the wrong Democrat ended up in the White House.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Longwell</h4><p begin="01:04:13.78" data-timestamp="3853.78"> I certainly would not want Bernie Sanders to be the President of the United States.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:04:19.49" data-timestamp="3859.49"> So if you ended up handing it to Sanders, that would not be a happy day for you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Longwell</h4><p begin="01:04:23.24" data-timestamp="3863.24"> Well, that's sort of like, do I want to be poisoned, or do I want to be shot? Those are just sort of bad choices. And I think America deserves better than to have choices between an old socialist and sort of an authoritarian sort of nativist. My choice is neither.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="01:04:40.16" data-timestamp="3880.16"> There's this scene in the HBO series on <i>Chernobyl</i> that's running right now where the nuclear reactor is about to explode. So these workers have to go into the basement of the power plant to try to open a valve. There's so much radiation, it seems certain they're going to die, but it will also save everyone else.</p><p begin="01:04:58.73" data-timestamp="3898.73">Sarah has been watching the show. I asked her if she ever thought about it like that. No, she said. Never. They're not asking someone to risk their life, they're asking someone to put their name in the hat to be the next president of the United States. Apparently, it's easier to get someone to walk into Chernobyl.</p><p begin="01:05:25.79" data-timestamp="3925.79">[MUSIC - STEVE FORBERT, "YOU CANNOT WIN IF YOU DO NOT PLAY"]</p><p begin="01:05:45.61" data-timestamp="3945.61">Our program was produced today by Zoe Chace and myself.
