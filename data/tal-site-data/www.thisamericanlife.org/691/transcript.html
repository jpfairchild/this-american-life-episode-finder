<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.57" data-timestamp="0.57"> OK, so one of my co-workers, David Kestenbaum, started telling me about this thing. And really, I thought he was completely-- I just-- there was no way it could be true. It just seemed completely ridiculous. And then, I got to say, the more he explained, the more it slowly started to seem like, OK, maybe he's right.</p><p begin="00:00:18.70" data-timestamp="18.7">Important fact to know about David before we go any further-- he has a PhD in physics, worked at Fermilab on subatomic particles, was on the team that discovered the top quark. And then this whole thing between him and me began when he told me to download an app onto my iPhone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:34.00" data-timestamp="34"> It's called Universe Splitter.</p><p begin="00:00:38.15" data-timestamp="38.15">[DING]</p><p begin="00:00:39.04" data-timestamp="39.04"></p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.48" data-timestamp="39.48"> OK, so now I've opened it up. And there's, like, a gray steel, fake steel background. And it says in white type on top of it, Universe Splitter, quantum-induced universe bifurcation. What do I do now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:00:54.21" data-timestamp="54.21"> All right, so tell me something you are having trouble making up your mind about what to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:05.15" data-timestamp="65.15"> You and I are recording this on December 31.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:07.69" data-timestamp="67.69"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:08.38" data-timestamp="68.38"> And I've had a week off. I grew a beard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:10.45" data-timestamp="70.45"> I noticed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:12.57" data-timestamp="72.57"> And I'm trying to decide if I should shave it off. And so that's something I'm trying to decide.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:19.21" data-timestamp="79.21"> I have an opinion on that, but--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:21.01" data-timestamp="81.01"> What's your opinion?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:21.99" data-timestamp="81.99"> [LAUGHS] Actually, I think it looks pretty good right now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:25.25" data-timestamp="85.25"> OK, so what does this Universe Splitter do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:28.57" data-timestamp="88.57"> It lets you do both. Like, it creates a duplicate of this universe so that in one you get to grow the beard, and in the other you shave it off.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:39.32" data-timestamp="99.32"> Wait, that's what we're going to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:40.61" data-timestamp="100.61"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.62" data-timestamp="101.62"> For pretend or for real?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:42.77" data-timestamp="102.77"> No, no, for real, maybe. This is a thing. It's called the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. And there are a lot of really smart physicists who think this is probably what's happening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:51.80" data-timestamp="111.8"> OK, so how does this work? Like, what do I do next?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:01:54.89" data-timestamp="114.89"> All right, so there are two boxes there?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:57.68" data-timestamp="117.68"> Yeah. In one box it says, In one universe, I will now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:02.69" data-timestamp="122.69"> OK, so put, shave off beard tonight.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:05.93" data-timestamp="125.93"> Hold on-- shave off beard tonight. OK, and then the other box is labeled, In the other universe. In the other one, I will now--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:19.84" data-timestamp="139.84"> Put keep beard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:21.98" data-timestamp="141.98"> Keep beard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:25.15" data-timestamp="145.15"> OK. And then what's below it?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:27.48" data-timestamp="147.48"> And then below it there's like a button with like, an atom drawn on it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:31.69" data-timestamp="151.69"> [LAUGHS] Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:32.58" data-timestamp="152.58"> Like an atom like you would draw it in a 1950s cartoon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:36.57" data-timestamp="156.57"> Yeah, that's like the aesthetic of the whole thing. It's like an old piece of scientific equipment.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:40.68" data-timestamp="160.68"> So what does it do when you push the button?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:02:43.33" data-timestamp="163.33"> So if you push the button, it sends a signal to a fancy piece of scientific equipment at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. And the equipment these days can be tiny, like a little box you can hold in your hand. And it does the following. It takes a single particle of light, a photon, it sends it at a kind of mirror that can make the photon either go left or right. You can think of it that way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:08.28" data-timestamp="188.28"> Like at random it'll go either left or right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:10.86" data-timestamp="190.86"> Well, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small things, it actually goes both. It's not that we don't know. It actually goes left and right at the same time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:24.05" data-timestamp="204.05"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:25.23" data-timestamp="205.23"> So that's super weird, right? But that is actually true, and demonstrated, and like we've known that since the '20s.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:33.12" data-timestamp="213.12"> OK. So then what happens in this device in Geneva?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:03:36.68" data-timestamp="216.68"> Yeah, so the device fires a photon which can go left or right. And then the device looks to see, well, where did it go? And we know the particle's in both places, right? But when the machine looks, it only finds it in one place. It shows it went either left or right, which doesn't make sense, right? Because we know from the math that the particle did go to both places. So why did we only see it in one of those places?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:01.02" data-timestamp="241.02"> And what's the answer?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:02.21" data-timestamp="242.21"> All right, so one of the answers is that the photon is in both places, left and right, but just in different universes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:11.71" data-timestamp="251.71"> Wait. So you're saying that when you shoot the photon into the mirror, it actually creates an entire duplicate of our universe. And in one of those universes, the photon is on the left, and the other it is on the right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:25.86" data-timestamp="265.86"> Yes. It both went left and right. Those are just in different universes. The math of it makes a lot of-- the math of it is very, like, streamlined and simple. I remember the day I saw it in class, and I was like, oh, my god. Maybe it's true.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:40.73" data-timestamp="280.73"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:42.02" data-timestamp="282.02"> So those boxes you filled out on the app--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.39" data-timestamp="284.39"> You mean the box where I typed in "shave off beard tonight", and the box where I typed in, keep beard?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:49.58" data-timestamp="289.58"> Right, right. So it'll basically choose one of those boxes if the photon goes left, and the other box if the photon goes right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:56.66" data-timestamp="296.66"> OK, got it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:04:57.41" data-timestamp="297.41"> You have to do what it says.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:59.36" data-timestamp="299.36"> You mean I have to keep the beard or shave off the beard like it tells me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:05:02.45" data-timestamp="302.45"> Yeah. Yeah, because when you press that button, you're going to get back one answer.

<h3>Act One: Dreams From My Father</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:48.23" data-timestamp="468.23"> Act 1, Dreams From My Father. So I was e-mailing with a fiction writer that we have on our show sometimes, Etgar Keret, about today's theme. And he told me that his father used to spend a lot of time imagining worlds like we're talking about in today's program-- parallel worlds to ours that are almost the same as our world, but not quite. And he said his father did this starting during World War II. His father was 14, living in Poland-- he was Jewish-- when the Germans invaded and started sending Jews to the concentration camps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:08:19.22" data-timestamp="499.22"> During the Second World War, him and his parents, they hid in a hole in the ground that they dug for 620 days. So he had a lot of spare time.</p><p begin="00:08:32.37" data-timestamp="512.37">And when he was there, he would imagine all kinds of things. He would imagine a world in which the Nazis didn't exist, or in which he wasn't a Jew, or in which people just in general didn't kill each other, you know? And this kind of thing was something that he associated with being a child. Then he kind of felt that it interested him as a child, then I will probably like it too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:56.46" data-timestamp="536.46"> Back during the war, his father couldn't leave that hole for almost two years. The Nazi headquarters was right there near the hole on the same property. A Christian farmer in his 80s would bring them food and haul out buckets of urine. They couldn't even talk a lot of the time. Etgar imagines it was like two years of meditation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:09:14.48" data-timestamp="554.48"> My father, the way that he would talk about his time in the hole, he would say that he would sleep, and then he would wake up, and then he would ask his father if the war was over. And his father would say no, so he would go and sleep some more. That's the way he would tell it to me. I think it's that kind of-- the softcore version.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:32.39" data-timestamp="572.39"> And was it like, when you say a hole, could they even stand up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:09:36.08" data-timestamp="576.08"> No. They couldn't stand in it, and they couldn't even lie down in it. They had to sit in it. And when the Russians liberated the town and they were brought out, they had to be carried out because their muscles were so cramped that, by the time of the end of the war, they couldn't move them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:57.63" data-timestamp="597.63"> Oh, my god. So basically they're in this hole, and they're sitting there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:10:04.58" data-timestamp="604.58"> Yes. And you know, it's like it's very, very cold, you know? It's way beyond freezing. And you don't have food. And you hear voices in German, and you know that you can easily be killed. And you close your eyes, and you think of another universe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:29.57" data-timestamp="629.57"> Etgar's written lots of fiction that imagines parallel worlds of various kinds. And when I asked him if he wanted to do something for today's show, he wrote this story-- a true story that starts when he was a kid.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Etgar Keret</h4><p begin="00:10:42.46" data-timestamp="642.46"> When I was six years old, my dad worked at a pool snack bar not far from one of Tel Aviv's beaches. Every day at 5:30 in the morning he'd leave home for the pool, swim 2 kilometers, shower in the locker room, and get to work. He wouldn't get home till 9:00 at night. 14 hours a day, 7 days a week unloading boxes of soft drinks, dressing toasted sandwiches, brewing coffee in gleaming glasses at the pool snack bar up by the beach.</p><p begin="00:11:17.70" data-timestamp="677.7">Years later, Dad always said those were the best days of his life, fondly remembering how the salty air blowing in from the sea would mix in his lungs with the smell of the coffee and the imported cigarettes he used to sell at the bar. Coffee, cigarettes, and the sea were always my father's three favorite things.</p><p begin="00:11:39.06" data-timestamp="699.06">For me, those days were not quite as happy. When Dad came back from work, I was already in bed. And other than Saturdays when I'd go off to visit him at the pool with my mom, I never saw him at all. Not that I was bitter about this. Six-year-old children can't really imagine a different world for themselves, one where their father had more time for them. They accept reality as it is. And yet, I missed him dearly.</p><p begin="00:12:09.63" data-timestamp="729.63">Seeing this, my mother suggested I go with him every morning to the pool, have a swim together, and take a cab to school from there. I don't remember anything of those morning swims, but the car rides with Dad are crystal clear.</p><p begin="00:12:25.23" data-timestamp="745.23">It's still dark as we sit in our Silver Peugeot 504, the windows rolled down, Dad smoking Kent 100s and describing parallel universes that exist at this very moment in other dimensions-- universes where everything is precisely identical to ours-- same road, same traffic light, same cigarette in the corner of Dad's mouth-- all except for one tiny difference. And this difference Dad would change every morning, changing the one detail in the parallel universe that differed from ours.</p><p begin="00:13:01.19" data-timestamp="781.19">Here we are in the parallel universe waiting at the exact same intersection for the light to change. Only in this universe, instead of a Silver Peugeot, we are riding a dragon. And here's another one where under my faded sweatpants hide gills which allow me to breathe under water like a fish.</p><p begin="00:13:29.11" data-timestamp="809.11">When I was nine, my father got a new job. He no longer had to get up so early in the morning. And in the evenings, we'd all have dinner together and watch the nightly news. I was 22 by the time I moved out of my parents' house, but I still made sure to visit them at least twice a week. And on Saturdays, I'd swim with Dad at the pool where he once worked.</p><p begin="00:13:54.15" data-timestamp="834.15">When I was 43, my father was diagnosed with cancer. It was tongue cancer, the result of 50 years of smoking. By the time the doctors caught on, it was at an advanced stage. And though we never spoke a word about it, it was obvious to us both that soon he was going to die.</p><p begin="00:14:15.94" data-timestamp="855.94">On Mondays, I take him in for his physical therapy. And as we sat in the waiting room to see the physical therapist with the British accent, my father sometimes still talked about parallel universes where everything was exactly the same as ours, save for one difference-- say, that dogs could speak, or that people could read minds, or that the sky was purple. And when the milk white clouds floated across it, they looked tasty enough to eat.</p><p begin="00:14:47.22" data-timestamp="887.22">At the end of every session, the physical therapist would show me how to hold my father's arm when we walked together and what I should do in case he lost his balance. On our way home as we approached the corner of King Solomon and Arlozorov, Dad would always stop. "Do you smell that?" he'd say, and point to the new cafe at the corner. "Just by the smell of it, I can tell you that's the best coffee in town."</p><p begin="00:15:16.33" data-timestamp="916.33">At this stage of his illness, the tongue cancer was so advanced my father could no longer eat or drink. Instead, he got all his food and liquids through a clear plastic tube straight to his stomach. On one of these Mondays after physical therapy while walking by the corner cafe on King Solomon and Arlozorov, my father, instead of just posing to praise the place as usual, suggested we actually go in for a cup of coffee.</p><p begin="00:15:51.44" data-timestamp="951.44">"Dad," I said after a moment's hesitation, "you can't drink anything. The tumor is blocking your esophagus." "I know," he said and patted me on the back, "but you can."</p><p begin="00:16:06.70" data-timestamp="966.7">We sat at a corner table on the sidewalk. I ordered a latte and a glass of water from the pretty waitress. And when she asked my father what he'd like, he asked for a double espresso. I stared at him, confused, and he smiled and shrugged. The waitress noticed Dad's guilty smile and gave me a questioning look. Not knowing what to say, I ordered an oatmeal cookie.</p><p begin="00:16:36.72" data-timestamp="996.72">Until the coffee arrived, we sat in silence. I wanted to ask my father why he'd ordered the coffee at all and if it had anything to do with the waitress being pretty, but I said nothing. Dad pulled a cigarette pack out of his shirt pocket and a lighter he had stored in his glasses case and set them both down on the table. We waited.</p><p begin="00:17:02.56" data-timestamp="1022.56">A few minutes later, the waitress returned with our order. She placed it on the table-- a latte, a glass of water, and a cookie in front of me, and a double espresso in front of Dad. Aromatic steam rose from my coffee. I wanted to drink it. But doing that in Dad's face seemed unfair, so I just kept staring at it.</p><p begin="00:17:26.53" data-timestamp="1046.53">When out of the corner of my eye, I saw my father quickly snatch the double espresso off the table and gulp it down in one sip. It was impossible. I knew it was impossible. After all, I was there in the room when the oncologists showed me and my mother the X-ray with the tumor resting above the blocked esophagus like a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a waffle cone.</p><p begin="00:17:50.10" data-timestamp="1070.1">My father, she said then, could never drink again. And here we were sitting together on a pleasant summer day at this hipster cafe, me still staring at my steaming cup of coffee, and him by my side, smiling after killing off his double espresso.</p><p begin="00:18:07.92" data-timestamp="1087.92">And for a moment there, I thought maybe we were in a parallel universe. Maybe he told me enough stories ever since I was a little boy to tear open a hole in the aching heart of our universe through which we were sucked into a parallel one, identical to our own in every way save for one exception. In this universe, my dad could drink and eat as much as he liked, and he was not about to die in just a few months.</p><p begin="00:18:40.80" data-timestamp="1120.8">The piping hot coffee slid down my father's windpipe and into his lungs. When it got there, Dad started to choke. He stood up and grabbed his throat with both hands. The wet wheezing noises he made were horrific-- the sound of a man whose lungs are flooded with hot coffee. A bespectacled man from the table next to us leaped up and asked my father if he needed any help.</p><p begin="00:19:08.45" data-timestamp="1148.45">I just sat there paralyzed. The parallel universe I had shared with my father moments ago had vanished, dropping me back into a far worse universe. A few more seconds of gargling followed, after which Dad leaned over and coughed up, evacuating all the fine Italian espresso that had filled his lungs.</p><p begin="00:19:31.09" data-timestamp="1171.09">When he was done, he sat up in his chair as if nothing had happened, inches away from the puddle of coffee and phlegm, and lit himself a cigarette. People at the tables around us kept staring at him. "What did I tell you?" He smiled at me and exhaled smoke from his nostrils. "The best coffee in town."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:00.55" data-timestamp="1200.55"> Etgar Keret. He's the author of many books.

So it's kind of grim to say this, but the moon landing-- that story of American triumph-- it could've gone in another way. In some other storyline from the multiverse, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they land on the moon, they walk around, it's great. But then there's a problem, and they cannot take off to come home. NASA thought this was the most dangerous moment in the mission, the most likely spot it could fail.</p><p begin="00:20:42.12" data-timestamp="1242.12">One of President Richard Nixon's speechwriters, William Safire, actually prepared a statement to be read in case that was the way the story went.

At the time Bob Shrum got the call, President Clinton was finally going to have to testify before independent counsel Ken Starr's grand jury. He would have to own up to the affair, and then afterwards say something to the nation. But what?</p><p begin="00:23:25.15" data-timestamp="1405.15">That was what the phone call was about. Shrum called Mark Penn back, who asked if he would take a shot at writing a speech for the president to be delivered on TV just after he gave his grand jury testimony. It would be the president's chance to frame the whole thing, maybe finally put it away and prevent the Republicans from starting impeachment proceedings. The country would be watching.

Shrum sat down with the rest of the country to watch it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:27:02.26" data-timestamp="1622.26"> We were just sitting around in the living room, watching it on television.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:27:05.47" data-timestamp="1625.47"> And at that point are you thinking, maybe he's going to read my speech?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:27:08.83" data-timestamp="1628.83"> Sure. I thought he might very well-- Bill Clinton, who I worked with on State of the Union messages, never exactly reads what you send him. So I didn't anticipate that it would be necessarily word for word what I had sent, but I thought it might be pretty close to it. It was almost diametrically the opposite.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Clinton</h4><p begin="00:27:30.74" data-timestamp="1650.74"> Good evening. This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the office of independent counsel and the grand jury. I answered their questions truthfully, including questions about my private life, questions no American citizen would ever want to answer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:27:51.02" data-timestamp="1671.02"> I not only remember hearing the first words, but I remember the look on his face. He was really, really angry. It's the private Bill Clinton who could get angry. And I have seen him angry, but I don't think the country had seen him angry very often.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Clinton</h4><p begin="00:28:06.02" data-timestamp="1686.02"> As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. Indeed, I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:28:34.64" data-timestamp="1714.64"> There are moments of apology in there and what feel like honest reflection, like when he straight up admits the reasons he had been so evasive until then.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Clinton</h4><p begin="00:28:42.52" data-timestamp="1722.52"> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors-- first, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:28:52.51" data-timestamp="1732.51"> But the overall message is not I'm sorry. I screwed up, he seems to be saying, but the real problem is the fact that I'm having to talk about this at all. It's a private family matter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Clinton</h4><p begin="00:29:03.22" data-timestamp="1743.22"> It's nobody's business but ours. Even presidents have private lives.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:29:10.57" data-timestamp="1750.57"> He closes not by asking for forgiveness, as Shrum had advised, but by asking people to stop gawking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Clinton</h4><p begin="00:29:16.87" data-timestamp="1756.87"> And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century. Thank you for watching, and good night.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:29:44.39" data-timestamp="1784.39"> What do you think would have happened if instead that night he'd taken out your speech and read it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:29:49.19" data-timestamp="1789.19"> I think it would have lessened the chances that he would've been impeached.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:29:52.73" data-timestamp="1792.73"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:29:54.23" data-timestamp="1794.23"> I don't know that it would have prevented the impeachment, but I think it would have lessened the chances.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:29:59.89" data-timestamp="1799.89"> It's possible his speech gets you to the same ending, just with a slightly different plot. And after all, there was a lot of momentum in Congress toward impeachment. But it's nice to contemplate a world where the leader of your country can stand up and acknowledge having made a mistake, can acknowledge reality.</p><p begin="00:30:16.93" data-timestamp="1816.93">An apology really is about the truth-- laying it out so we can all live in the same world together. It's impossible to imagine that happening now. Clinton seemed closer to it at that moment, but he still couldn't do it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:30:29.93" data-timestamp="1829.93"> I wonder, of all the possible universes, in how many of them does Clinton say I'm sorry, you know? Not I'm sorry for what happened, or I'm sorry if people feel-- but really like I'm sorry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:30:44.08" data-timestamp="1844.08"> There may be a universe in which he did that. I'm just not aware of it, because I don't live in it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:30:48.55" data-timestamp="1848.55"> [LAUGHS] Yeah, that's not the one we live in.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:30:52.01" data-timestamp="1852.01"> You want to know what I think? I think it's possible there is no universe in which President Clinton reads Bob Shrum's speech. Listening to the speech Clinton did give, I kind of think he gives it in every possible universe. It was exactly how he felt.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:31:07.17" data-timestamp="1867.17"> And the speech that you wrote, while great, was not at all how he was feeling at that moment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:31:12.36" data-timestamp="1872.36"> Obviously, the speech that I drafted did not reflect how he felt coming out of the grand jury.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:31:18.18" data-timestamp="1878.18"> In that sense, can you fault him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Shrum</h4><p begin="00:31:21.31" data-timestamp="1881.31"> I just think you want to do what fits the moment, and you want to be true to yourself.

He does not mention Shrum's draft of the speech, but he does say that most of his advisors had counseled him to simply admit that he had made an awful mistake-- not to go out swinging. He did anyway, of course.</p><p begin="00:32:28.62" data-timestamp="1948.62">Weeks after that speech, he backtracked in front of a smaller audience at a prayer breakfast with religious leaders. He took a different tone there. He said, "I agree with those who have said that in my first statement after I testified I was not contrite enough." It was much closer to what Shrum had written. He included an apology to Monica Lewinsky and her family.</p><p begin="00:32:49.11" data-timestamp="1969.11">Coming up, worried that you're living in a parallel universe where some very basic facts about your own life have been altered?

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:25.47" data-timestamp="2005.47"> We've arrived at Act 3 of our show, Act 3-- Sklar-Crossed Brothers.</p><p begin="00:33:31.05" data-timestamp="2011.05">So if you think about it, being an identical twin is kind of a parallel world situation. You know, you have this other version of yourself stuck in the same world as you, stuck in the same house as you. You see somebody who's just like you running around, doing things that you might not do.</p><p begin="00:33:47.12" data-timestamp="2027.12">Dana Chivvis has this next story about a mother, her twins, and a 48-year-old mystery.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:33:53.66" data-timestamp="2033.66"> Annette Sklar had a lot going on in the winter of '72. In January, she delivered twin boys-- Jason first, followed by Randy 5 minutes later. Weighing 5 pounds, 2 ounces, Randy had to spend the first days of life in an incubator.</p><p begin="00:34:08.02" data-timestamp="2048.02">They lived in suburban St. Louis. Annette's husband Dick had a job at a paper company, called Tension Envelope. He worked long hours and traveled a lot. Annette was often at home alone caring for two infants-- feeding them, changing diapers, and making sure she didn't lose track of which one was which, because they looked exactly alike.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:34:27.91" data-timestamp="2067.91"> Were you always scared that you might mix them up? Like from the day they were born, was that a real fear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:34:34.48" data-timestamp="2074.48"> I tried to be really careful about knowing who either had-- what outfit they were on. I knew-- I was really careful about it. So usually, we had outfits in different colors-- blue, blue Jay, and red, Randy red. And then I didn't think about it too much, once I knew it was.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:34:52.33" data-timestamp="2092.33"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:34:52.80" data-timestamp="2092.8"> [LAUGHS] That's how we did it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:34:54.82" data-timestamp="2094.82"> That's a good system.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:34:56.24" data-timestamp="2096.24"> I mean, I think I did feed them twice, one of them, and didn't feed the other one. That happens, sometimes. You did that. You did that. One of them was eating, the other one was crying a lot. And I go, why is he crying so much?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:35:09.52" data-timestamp="2109.52"> She even had a back-up-- a creative redundancy she built into the safety plan for their identities. And that was diaper pins. She used blue diaper pins for Jason, and yellow ones for Randy.</p><p begin="00:35:21.07" data-timestamp="2121.07">Everything went smoothly for a while. And then at six weeks, they had their first check-up. Annette dressed them in the same outfit-- a fancy number their aunt in Los Angeles had sent them. But underneath the clothes, the diaper pin system was up and running.</p><p begin="00:35:35.26" data-timestamp="2135.26">At the doctor's office, a nurse took the babies out of the room. Annette can't really remember why. Maybe she needed to weigh them. And a few minutes later, the nurse came back in with the boys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:35:43.69" data-timestamp="2143.69"> And she goes, oh, we have such a great surprise for you. Now we have Pampers. We're just using them for the first time. So instead of using your diapers, we used your Pampers.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:35:53.04" data-timestamp="2153.04"> Oh, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:35:53.92" data-timestamp="2153.92"> And then they gave me all four of their tins.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:35:58.27" data-timestamp="2158.27"> The nurse had changed the babies out of their cloth diapers and put them into disposable ones, foiling the system entirely. She handed Annette a little bag with the diaper pins in it. The boys were completely indistinguishable.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:36:10.45" data-timestamp="2170.45"> I was very upset. So they go, oh, you're going to be fine. You're fine. Of course, they go, you're fine. And we got in the car, and I was so upset the whole way home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:36:19.27" data-timestamp="2179.27"> When she got home, Annette put the babies on the couch and stared at them. At six weeks old, they didn't have distinct personalities yet. They weighed the same amount. They had the same bald heads. No birthmarks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:36:30.37" data-timestamp="2190.37"> And I'm not kidding you, they looked exactly alike.

And he goes, really? He goes, oh, we'll figure it out. Let's see.</p><p begin="00:37:40.75" data-timestamp="2260.75">And then we were both looking at both of them right next to each other.

(LAUGHING) I go, I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:37:59.78" data-timestamp="2279.78"> Annette was faced with a decision.

They're comedians. They work together.

They were spending a summer weekend at the world famous Lake of the Ozarks in central Missouri with their mom and Aunt Linda and her two sons. The boys were playing while Annette and Aunt Linda talked amongst themselves. The story of the calamitous doctor's visit came up. And unbeknownst to them, Jason and Randy were in earshot, and they overheard the whole thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Sklar</h4><p begin="00:39:48.65" data-timestamp="2388.65"> And we were just-- we hated the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:39:52.03" data-timestamp="2392.03"> This is Jason. He sounds remarkably like Randy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Sklar</h4><p begin="00:39:55.41" data-timestamp="2395.41"> We were livid that this could have happened, and also that she was sharing it in sort of an offhand kind of joking way. And Linda Wallace, who is a funny woman, was making it funnier. And they were laughing about it. And we were like-- we were just very embarrassed by it and upset by it. Like, oh my god, this is an insane thing to hear, because we may not be who we are.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:40:15.67" data-timestamp="2415.67"> What pissed you off about it? What was so upsetting about it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Sklar</h4><p begin="00:40:19.39" data-timestamp="2419.39"> I think that it just was we were just sensitive, I think, to being confused. And again, it was this narrative that kind of went through our lives, as we wanted to be individuals and we wanted to be seen as individuals. And then here's this thing that happened where we could be so easily confused.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:40:38.34" data-timestamp="2438.34"> For identical twins-- two people who are constantly being mistaken for one another, who try really hard to make it clear that they're unique individuals-- this was a big deal. Randy was the most upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Annette Sklar</h4><p begin="00:40:49.72" data-timestamp="2449.72"> He goes, why can't you go to the policemen? I think Randy really wanted me to go there. We were talking all the way to the car.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:40:57.61" data-timestamp="2457.61"> Not that an actual crime had been committed, just a crime against their dignity. But for some reason, Randy figured the police were the ones who could sort it out. But Annette did not go to the police. And the name confusion did not get sorted out, it remained a mystery in Jason and Randy's lives.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linda Wallace</h4><p begin="00:41:13.61" data-timestamp="2473.61"> The couple times that it was brought up throughout their years, if somebody said something about it, they would go, I don't want to hear about it. Don't bring it up again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:41:25.32" data-timestamp="2485.32"> Wow. I had no idea it was that painful for them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linda Wallace</h4><p begin="00:41:31.08" data-timestamp="2491.08"> I mean, it was a joke between Annette and I that I'm not sure was a joke between all of us, because they were very sensitive about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Randy Sklar</h4><p begin="00:41:42.86" data-timestamp="2502.86"> Just the simple fact of the matter that for countless times in our lives, someone has said to me, Jason?

If that's not true, there is--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Sklar</h4><p begin="00:41:59.51" data-timestamp="2519.51"> You have to go back to every single one of those people and apologize.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Randy Sklar</h4><p begin="00:42:01.55" data-timestamp="2521.55"> --and apologize.

But still, that's unsettling in a weird way, to me. That's just weird that for all this time I had it wrong.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:42:20.89" data-timestamp="2540.89"> If they were switched, then they have to re-imagine something that's so foundational nobody ever thinks about it-- their birth. Who's older? Who was in the incubator? Like Randy says, it's weird. It doesn't really make a difference, but also somehow it does. And not knowing what the truth is, that's even more unnerving.</p><p begin="00:42:48.33" data-timestamp="2568.33">It turns out there was one way to figure it out. Sometime around the age of 40-- Randy can't remember exactly when-- the topic of their potentially swapped identities came up. And they were like, why haven't we figured this out yet? They were grown ass adults. They should know who they actually were. And also, they were working as comedians at that point, and they thought it might be good material, which-- we'll see.</p><p begin="00:43:11.37" data-timestamp="2591.37">Randy thought maybe the hospital where they were born would have a copy of their baby fingerprints. They could get those and compare them to their adult fingerprints. He wasn't wrong about the science part of that. Identical twins have nearly the same DNA, so their fingerprint patterns are very similar-- closer than anyone else's.</p><p begin="00:43:28.41" data-timestamp="2608.41">As you probably know, fingerprints are made up of lines. And some of those lines have tiny variations in them, like forks or loops. And those markings are different between identical twins. For those of you still listening, the reason for that is that the markings develop based on the conditions in the womb, like pressure, which is different depending on where the baby is in the womb.</p><p begin="00:43:49.76" data-timestamp="2629.76">So Randy called the hospital where they were born to see if they still had a copy of their fingerprints. The hospital told them that they throw birth records out after 30 years. They were old and out of luck.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Randy Sklar</h4><p begin="00:44:00.80" data-timestamp="2640.8"> Until I was back home last summer with my family--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dana Chivvis</h4><p begin="00:44:04.62" data-timestamp="2644.62"> This is Randy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Randy Sklar</h4><p begin="00:44:05.75" data-timestamp="2645.75"> --and I was digging through, just looking at stuff--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jason Sklar</h4><p begin="00:44:08.90" data-timestamp="2648.9"> In St. Louis.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Randy Sklar</h4><p begin="00:44:09.50" data-timestamp="2649.5"> --in St. Louis.

It was very much do as I say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:53:58.86" data-timestamp="3238.86"> She almost lived a totally different life. Emily was adopted from South Korea when she was a baby. She's 40 now. And as a kid, she rarely thought about the world she came from, what her life would have been like there. It was the '80s. That kind of thing wasn't especially encouraged. Her family raised her not to ask many questions about her past, but there was one thing she really wanted to know about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:54:20.37" data-timestamp="3260.37"> I mean, mostly growing up I just really wondered what my birth mother looked like.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:54:24.77" data-timestamp="3264.77"> Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:54:26.61" data-timestamp="3266.61"> That was usually the question that always came to my mind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:54:30.54" data-timestamp="3270.54"> Her adoptive parents didn't look like her. They were white, as was most everybody else in town, so it was hard for her to picture her birth mother's face. But there was no one to ask.</p><p begin="00:54:42.09" data-timestamp="3282.09">A couple of decades later, Emily became a mother herself and suddenly, felt connected to and curious about her birth mother again. She started researching how to contact her and, two long years later, finally got in touch.</p><p begin="00:54:55.47" data-timestamp="3295.47">Then she decided to go on a trip to South Korea to meet her birth mother-- a trip that would allow her to tunnel between the universe that was into the universe that might have been. She recorded parts of it for a podcast called, <i>Motherhood</i> <i>Sessions.</i> All of Emily's emotions about the trip hit her on the way to the airport in New York when suddenly she found herself sobbing while talking to the cab driver.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cab Driver</h4><p begin="00:55:17.07" data-timestamp="3317.07"> Do you have any family in Korea?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:55:19.83" data-timestamp="3319.83"> I'm meeting my birth mother for the first time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cab Driver</h4><p begin="00:55:23.06" data-timestamp="3323.06"> That is exciting for you. Who told about your birth mother?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:55:28.27" data-timestamp="3328.27"> I searched for her through the adoption agency. It took two years-- two years of searching.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cab Driver</h4><p begin="00:55:36.82" data-timestamp="3336.82"> Oh, that's good. That's good. And what about your dad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:55:39.94" data-timestamp="3339.94"> I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cab Driver</h4><p begin="00:55:40.80" data-timestamp="3340.8"> You don't know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:55:41.31" data-timestamp="3341.31"> I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cab Driver</h4><p begin="00:55:42.23" data-timestamp="3342.23"> OK, don't worry about that anything. It should be better, everything. And it's a very blessing for you. You're going to meet your mother. I know. I know you're feeling, because you've spend your whole life without your mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:56:01.59" data-timestamp="3361.59"> [SOBS]</p><p begin="00:56:03.55" data-timestamp="3363.55"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cab Driver</h4><p begin="00:56:06.49" data-timestamp="3366.49"> I know you spent your whole life without your mom. You need your mom on when your children-- like you babies, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:56:14.62" data-timestamp="3374.62"> Yeah.</p><p begin="00:56:17.08" data-timestamp="3377.08">Going on the plane, too, for me, it was kind of thinking about the last time I took that flight was when I was a baby. And touching down, I remember thinking that the last time I was here was when I was five months old.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:56:34.25" data-timestamp="3394.25"> She had a day to settle in before she met her birth mother. It was the first time she'd ever been to Asia. And wandering around Seoul, it was so easy to imagine the other versions of her life all around her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:56:45.76" data-timestamp="3405.76"> I'd go in stores, or in restaurants, and I'd think, oh, could I be that woman behind the counter working there? When I'd see a mom with her little girl, I'd be like, oh, wow, is that what it would've been like to walk down the street holding my mom's hand?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:57:13.90" data-timestamp="3433.9"> On her second day in Korea, Emily carefully did her hair and makeup and headed to the adoption agency to meet her birth mother. Their reunion happened in a worn down meeting room in front of a bulletin board pinned with Christmas cards.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:57:27.13" data-timestamp="3447.13"> I see this short Korean woman walk in the door. And we hug, and I cry a lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily's Birth Mother</h4><p begin="00:57:45.68" data-timestamp="3465.68"> [SPEAKING KOREAN]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:57:47.16" data-timestamp="3467.16"> And she says [KOREAN], which means I'm sorry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:57:51.93" data-timestamp="3471.93"> It's the very first thing her birth mother says to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:57:54.52" data-timestamp="3474.52"> [SPEAKING KOREAN]. And I say [KOREAN], which means it's OK. [KOREAN]</p><p begin="00:58:03.95" data-timestamp="3483.95">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:58:06.92" data-timestamp="3486.92"></p><p begin="00:58:09.39" data-timestamp="3489.39">It's like looking in a mirror.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Social Worker</h4><p begin="00:58:11.02" data-timestamp="3491.02"> [SPEAKING KOREAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:58:12.87" data-timestamp="3492.87"> That's a social worker in the room translating for them. Emily's birth mother told her her story. She'd gotten pregnant as a teenager, which was completely shunned. There was no place in society for teenage single mothers.</p><p begin="00:58:27.30" data-timestamp="3507.3">A few days after Emily was born, a relative came by with a police officer and social worker, and they took Emily away. A week later, Emily's birth mother went to the police station, desperate to get her baby back. They told her it was too late.</p><p begin="00:58:43.56" data-timestamp="3523.56">She called the adoption agency several times over the years to check in on her daughter. Learned she'd been adopted by an American family. I talked with her on the phone. And when I asked her if she'd ever imagine the world where she did manage to get Emily back, she told me, I haven't really had those thoughts, but I always dreamt about her.</p><p begin="00:59:09.96" data-timestamp="3549.96">Seeing her birth mother's face, meeting her whole extended family later on that trip, it had a profound impact on Emily. I heard her talk about it on that podcast, <i>Motherhood</i> <i>Sessions.</i> And I was surprised and moved to hear her say that being in the same room with her birth family--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="00:59:25.86" data-timestamp="3565.86"> For the first time, I felt pretty, you know? Because growing up, your parents always tell you that you're pretty, or whatever. But I never really believed it. But being around this family, and we all look alike, you know? I felt like I was beautiful. And I had never felt it that deeply before.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="00:59:59.92" data-timestamp="3599.92"> And what do you think is behind that feeling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="01:00:04.22" data-timestamp="3604.22"> Because after growing up, living a lifetime of feeling like you don't fit in and wondering why maybe certain guys don't like you, or why maybe you're not the most popular person in school. You know, for the first time in my life, I felt like I made sense. I felt like my being made sense. I felt like my face made sense.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="01:00:32.15" data-timestamp="3632.15"> Emily stayed with her birth family for three days in a town called Dongducheon in a little house by the railroad tracks. There were ceramic pots of kimchi in the yard, a flat screen TV in the living room that was always playing Korean variety shows and soap operas. Lots of visitors came by to welcome Emily. It felt warm, familiar.</p><p begin="01:00:52.58" data-timestamp="3652.58">On the first night, Emily was getting ready for bed, and her birth mother came in and presented her with four boxes containing gold jewelry for Emily, her kids, and her husband. Emily accepted them, hesitantly. Then using a translation app, her birth mother told her--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="01:01:10.40" data-timestamp="3670.4"> She said Korean mothers sleep with their children. And I'm like, oh, god, here we go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="01:01:16.28" data-timestamp="3676.28"> Emily had heard about this-- that it's not unusual for Korean parents to sleep in the same room as their kids, even when they're adults. In this room, there was only one bed. She tried to explain to her birth mother, sorry, but I prefer to sleep alone. It wasn't clicking. Emily ended up calling an interpreter she'd hired who had already gone home for the day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Emily</h4><p begin="01:01:37.56" data-timestamp="3697.56"> And so I called her and asked her to explain that I couldn't do it. And she did, but you could see that my birth mother was pissed and not really happy about it. She had missed years and years of my life. I can understand why she'd want to sleep in the same room with me, but I just couldn't do it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Diane Wu</h4><p begin="01:02:09.42" data-timestamp="3729.42"> A lot of the time with her birth mother was like this. As a visitor, it was impossible to fit in completely. She was a stranger and family all at the same time, dropping into a place that really felt like it could be home-- but it wasn't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:02:31.98" data-timestamp="3751.98"> Diane Wu is our show's managing editor.
