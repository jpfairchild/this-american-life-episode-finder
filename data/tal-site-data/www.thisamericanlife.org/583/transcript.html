<h3>&#8232;Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:00.46" data-timestamp="0.46">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Chana Joffe-Walt sitting in for Ira Glass this week. In today's show, we've got stories of people at a moment of understanding something they could not have grasped before when they were younger-- stories from childhood, 10 years old, all the way up through old age, 79.</p><p begin="00:00:21.06" data-timestamp="21.06">So let's start at the beginning. I should say that the entire premise of this show, the idea that there are certain things that do not make sense when you're young, it is flat out offensive to the people at the beginning of our story.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:33.88" data-timestamp="33.88">Have you guys ever heard the phrase, you'll understand this when you're older? Or this will make sense--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernard</h4><p begin="00:00:37.91" data-timestamp="37.91">Oh, my gosh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Samantha</h4><p begin="00:00:39.00" data-timestamp="39">Yes. A bunch of times.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:00:39.93" data-timestamp="39.93">I'm sitting with a half dozen sixth graders at a table in their middle school. And a small guy with glasses and a comic book name Bernard Arthur keeps shaking his head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernard</h4><p begin="00:00:50.64" data-timestamp="50.64">I'm at the point where I'm used to it now, you know? Because they say it lots of times. And it's not only from my mom. It's from her friends, from adults, and from everybody. So I'm just really sick of it.</p><p begin="00:01:08.73" data-timestamp="68.73">To be honest, to be completely honest--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:13.01" data-timestamp="73.01">Be completely honest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernard</h4><p begin="00:01:14.11" data-timestamp="74.11">I know-- we all know mostly everything about life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:21.30" data-timestamp="81.3">Wait, so you don't believe that phrase at all?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernard</h4><p begin="00:01:24.43" data-timestamp="84.43">It's not like we know everything, but we know mostly what adults think we don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:01:35.19" data-timestamp="95.19">Bernard just feels like that stuff you think I'm not ready for? I am. Let's talk.</p><p begin="00:01:40.55" data-timestamp="100.55">At least three kids at the table raise a finger and politely say, "um, I'd like to add to that." They've all got examples of questions they asked recently that were met with some version of, you'll understand later. A brief selection, why do you smoke? Why did she commit suicide? Why do I have to go to school?</p><p begin="00:02:00.95" data-timestamp="120.95">What does it mean to hit puberty? Who is puberty? And why would you hit her?</p><p begin="00:02:05.87" data-timestamp="125.87">How do you say butt hole in Spanish? It's a pretty broad range, right?</p><p begin="00:02:11.18" data-timestamp="131.18">A girl named Samantha Boome says sometimes you don't even have to ask a question to be shut down with the "you'll understand later," even if it's not those exact words. Like the other night, she came into the kitchen. And her mom and grandpa were talking in loud voices, maybe they were fighting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Samantha</h4><p begin="00:02:27.11" data-timestamp="147.11">And I was like, "hey, can I get the cookie jar to get some cookies?" And they're like, "no. You can't. You'll learn when you get older."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:33.66" data-timestamp="153.66">She's saying, you'll learn when you get older.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Samantha</h4><p begin="00:02:35.56" data-timestamp="155.56">I'm like, but I was just asking for a cookie. She's like, "I'm not in the mood right now. I'm talking to your grandfather." I'm like, "oh, my god. But, Mom, chill out." And then I had to walk out of the room. I'm like, sheesh. Now I can't get a cookie.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:02:47.92" data-timestamp="167.92">I think to kids, this phrase can feel both dismissive and like we, the adults, are abdicating our responsibility, giving up on even trying. Like Jasper Pena says, when he asks what seems like a pretty simple question, sometimes grown-ups say--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jasper</h4><p begin="00:03:03.31" data-timestamp="183.31">Probably only God knows the answer. I don't know the answer, but I know that God knows it. And I get frustrated when they say that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:03:12.07" data-timestamp="192.07">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jasper</h4><p begin="00:03:13.29" data-timestamp="193.29">Because you're like, I know that they know the answers. And something's telling me they know the answers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Samantha</h4><p begin="00:03:25.37" data-timestamp="205.37">You can't have a conv-- you can, but you can't like physically have a conversation with him and ask him the question. That's like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:03:32.83" data-timestamp="212.83">With God?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Samantha</h4><p begin="00:03:33.69" data-timestamp="213.69">Yeah. It's better if you ask an actual person because they will actually give you an answer because they know the people, instead of God.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:03:42.30" data-timestamp="222.3">She wants an actual person. These kids want answers. Well, today on our show, we have answers. Or rather, we have people arriving at the answers themselves, with or without the help of others. People looking ahead in time for clues of what's to come, and looking back at the remarkable facts that they somehow missed. We're going to travel from childhood on up, stopping at all the points where people do understand, finally. We've got Sasheer Zamata from <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Live</i>. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Adolescence</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:04:21.75" data-timestamp="261.75">Act One, Adolescence. When the biggest thing that does not make sense is often just the immediate future and how you're going to get through it. Here's Hillary Frank.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:04:32.38" data-timestamp="272.38">There's this kid in my town. We'll call him Ben. A few years ago, Ben was starting high school, and he turned 15. He asked his parents if he could throw a party. They said yes, but if we see any alcohol, we're shutting it down. Ben's like, fine.</p><p begin="00:04:47.99" data-timestamp="287.99">The day of the party he takes a walk with his five closest guy friends. They're sort of his planning committee. They tell him they're going to text invites to, like, 30 people. Mostly, they're other geeky guy friends. Also, their friends tell him, we're going to invite some popular girls.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:05:04.18" data-timestamp="304.18">They were basically like, you'll be the man for a week if you do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:05:08.32" data-timestamp="308.32">They all go back to Ben's house. And the popular girls, they're actually the first to show up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:05:13.94" data-timestamp="313.94">And then half an hour in, I make the biggest mistake of my life up to this point when one of the girls, one of the "popular," quote, unquote, girls asked me what my address was. And in my mind-- in my freshman mind-- they were getting picked up. They were already getting picked up, like they were telling their parents to come get them. Because that's what asking for an address meant to me at this time, like, completely innocent thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:05:39.75" data-timestamp="339.75">Four or five more girls asked for Ben's address. Of course, these kids are not calling their rides. They're texting his address to all their friends.</p><p begin="00:05:49.47" data-timestamp="349.47">So the party slowly starts growing. And then a bunch of older kids show up. Then Ben hears banging outside on his garage door. Suddenly, there's a bunch of upperclassman everywhere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:06:01.88" data-timestamp="361.88">They were coming up from behind, in the flanks, and the front. And people were looking in the bushes and crawling to all the different windows, looking in, seeing who's in there. I'd say about half of them are people I know. But it's the people I know that I would never want them to come. And it's kids that bullied me in middle school and elementary school. And they're calling people inside trying to get in through the back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:06:35.00" data-timestamp="395">This thing that was happening to Ben, it's straight out of every memorable teen party movie. His little birthday celebration was crashed. But what was happening here is different from those movies in one key way, a way that seems to be specific to my town and towns nearby.</p><p begin="00:06:52.64" data-timestamp="412.64">Upperclassman conspire to target freshman parties, freshman like Ben. And at these parties, the parents are home. The older kids, though, they are not deterred by parents. Parents can be yelling at them to get off their lawn, and the kids will pretend to go, but really they are sneaking in around back. And once they get in, they tell the younger kids, this is our party now.</p><p begin="00:07:19.59" data-timestamp="439.59">This is so common in my town that parents are calling it parasiting. They try to deal with it themselves. They try not to call the cops. They don't want their kids to be humiliated, but it can get overwhelming.</p><p begin="00:07:32.06" data-timestamp="452.06">One mom I talked to got a call from a friend while this was going on at her house. The friend warned her, they'll find a way around you. You can't stop them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:07:41.88" data-timestamp="461.88">It's like a military raid. It's like D-Day. It's like any sort of multifaceted attack where the base is just completely up for grabs and anything goes. And all morals are just thrown out the window completely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:08:03.59" data-timestamp="483.59">The party has more than doubled in size. There are now 70 kids at Ben's house. His mom's on the lawn, calling out kids by name and threatening to tell their parents that they were here. His dad is getting into it with some kid who's trying to push his way inside the house.</p><p begin="00:08:20.11" data-timestamp="500.11">Ben looks around. He's surrounded by strangers-- older strangers. They're chugging beer. They're on their phones explaining to their friends the best method of breaking into the house. Ben's standing right next to them as they're doing this. Someone turns up the music, and a corner of the basement suddenly becomes a dance floor. The toilet is full of beer cans.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:08:41.21" data-timestamp="521.21">There is this girl who's chugging something. I don't remember. I told her, "can you please not do this?" And she looked at me and in the most rude, sarcastic voice said to me, "like, thanks for the hospitality," and turned around and just trudged back in a different direction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:08:57.67" data-timestamp="537.67">After about an hour, kids started calling their friends telling them to not bother coming in. This party was lame. And as quickly as they came, they left.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:09:06.73" data-timestamp="546.73">I was freaking out the entire time. I'm still freaking out about it just thinking about it. It was horrible. It was pretty scarring.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:09:13.45" data-timestamp="553.45">For the rest of Ben's freshman year, he was terrified of older kids. He'd go to parties, but he hated when they'd get blown up. He hated when the older kids would take their control away.</p><p begin="00:09:23.92" data-timestamp="563.92">But Ben grew up. He's a senior now. And he says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:09:27.60" data-timestamp="567.6">Somewhere between softball and junior year, I just decided I was completely comfortable with showing up with my friends to random people's houses and treating them with the same lack of respect that I was treated with when I was in ninth grade because that's what you do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:09:43.98" data-timestamp="583.98">He started getting those texts saying there's a party happening at so-and-so's and house. Let's blow it up. He started getting invited more and more till eventually the text would just be an address, nothing else. But he'd know what it meant.</p><p begin="00:09:57.75" data-timestamp="597.75">[YELLING]</p><p begin="00:09:59.61" data-timestamp="599.61"></p><p begin="00:10:02.40" data-timestamp="602.4">This sound comes from a video that Ben sent me that one of his friends shot at a party.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:10:07.24" data-timestamp="607.24">All the (PRETENDING TO YELL) "yo's" and "look at that"-- it's all just like you're kind of in awe where you've ended up in that moment. "That's that kid from my biology class. Like, oh, my god. Come over here."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:10:24.07" data-timestamp="624.07">That's one of the things Ben told me he loves about crashing freshman parties. You never know who's going to show up. It's like nobody's invited, so everybody's invited.</p><p begin="00:10:34.28" data-timestamp="634.28">Also, it's super convenient. There's always a party because you don't have to wait for your friend's parents to go out of town. And Ben says it's thrilling, what it takes to get into the house -- the Black Ops -- getting intel from your friends inside about which entryways are guarded and which are clear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:10:51.46" data-timestamp="651.46">But yes, it is like a stealth mission a lot of the times, seeking out which route is the most efficient form of entry. Next time, maybe I'll bring a notepad and sketch out my ideas or draw a blueprint of the house because that's basically what we're doing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:11:07.85" data-timestamp="667.85">And it feels OK to you, even though that happened to you when you were a freshman?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:11:12.35" data-timestamp="672.35">Well, let me put it this way. And this is kind of not the best mentality. But if I don't show up, nothing is going to change. So I'm going to show up like everyone else because me not going isn't going to stop anything from happening.</p><p begin="00:11:27.25" data-timestamp="687.25">Well, in reality, I never pictured myself as one of those kids. We would always be like, wow, those kids are such jerks. We'll never be like them. But once you're older, you just-- your mindset turns into, I am one of the older kids. I have power over the younger kids. And that is a new form of intimidation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:11:53.06" data-timestamp="713.06">Ben spent two hours at my house sitting on my couch answering my questions. It all seemed to be getting a little too real for him. He was struggling to make sense of the boy he'd been and the man he'd become. By the end, he was lying down, rubbing his head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:12:09.25" data-timestamp="729.25">Wow, I'm really just-- I'm really just conflicting myself everywhere.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:12:13.57" data-timestamp="733.57">Ben started philosophizing, talking about all the ways you change so quickly during those years in high school. He told me there are three phases when it comes to blowing up parties. Phase one is when you get blown up. You're an innocent, naive little freshman. Phase two, you're doing the blowing up. And it is deliciously sadistic. Phase three, you're kind of over it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:12:36.17" data-timestamp="756.17">And I realized that that's just like the circle of life in high school. It's like at a certain point you reach a sort of wise, old sage status because I guess we're getting more mature now. But there is a gap between your immaturity and your maturity where you're still immature but you think you aren't.</p><p begin="00:12:57.06" data-timestamp="777.06">So you take the authority, and you say, I have the right to show up at this person's house because I'm old. And I'm 16 years old. And I'm going to be applying to college soon. And I grew a mustache a few days ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:13:16.20" data-timestamp="796.2">What would you say now to your freshman self?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ben</h4><p begin="00:13:22.09" data-timestamp="802.09">I would say, don't let other people decide who's going to come to your house. Or I would say, don't have a party ever.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:13:36.84" data-timestamp="816.84">Ben's got a few months left in his senior year. He's more choosy about parties these days, but he says he'll still go because he's got to do this while he still can. In the fall, he'll start college. And he's pretty sure the parties there will be more sophisticated. And by that, I mean he won't have to break and enter. He'll walk through the front door like a real grown-up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:14:00.77" data-timestamp="840.77">Hillary Frank is host of the wonderful parenting podcast <i>The</i> <i>Longest</i> <i>Shortest</i> <i>Time</i>.

She's on <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Live</i>. She does a lot of her own stand-up. And like a lot of comics, Sasheer uses the stage to rehash real things that happened to her and try to make sense of them.</p><p begin="00:14:30.61" data-timestamp="870.61">But recently, Sasheer felt like there was more to figure out about the stuff she was saying on stage. A warning-- the thing that kicked this off for her involves a nasty word, a racial slur. And there is no way for her to tell what happened without saying it a bunch of times. Sasheer's story about this starts with her on stage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sasheer Zamata</h4><p begin="00:14:49.54" data-timestamp="889.54">I got called the n-word once in my life, thankfully.

But my mom would often drop little tidbits of information like that. And like most kids, I ignored them because she's my mom. And her life before being my mom didn't really concern me.

She was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.</p><p begin="00:18:01.99" data-timestamp="1081.99">And she stopped to let this old, white couple to pass in front of her. And she lets out this deep sigh like, ehh, white people. And I was like, uhh. They're not even talking to us right now. What's the issue? And she goes, memories. And that's where the conversation stopped.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:18:24.92" data-timestamp="1104.92">The conversation stopped there because she never went into those memories. And I also never asked about them. I just assumed that my mom said things like that because she was old-school or close-minded. But I'm getting older. And I'm thinking about race more. I'm talking about it more in my act. And I thought, I should talk to my mom about this stuff. Why does she hate white people?</p><p begin="00:18:48.96" data-timestamp="1128.96">Until a few months ago, I knew very little about what she went through. I knew that in the '60s, my mom became one of the first black students to integrate a white junior high school in Forrest City, Arkansas. It was a big deal. She was part of history. And that's something I figured she'd be proud of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ivory</h4><p begin="00:19:06.10" data-timestamp="1146.1">No, I didn't feel like it was a good thing. We never had a choice in the matter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sasheer Zamata</h4><p begin="00:19:13.80" data-timestamp="1153.8">When she says "we," she means her and her siblings. It was her mom who had the choice. I didn't know it was an option for families, that they got to choose whether they'd desegregate schools. I just thought some law was passed, and everyone agreed to go for it. But my grandmother basically forced my mom and several of her siblings to join the civil rights movement as pre-teens and go to a school where they weren't wanted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ivory</h4><p begin="00:19:39.43" data-timestamp="1179.43">She had said that the reason that she wanted her kids to go to the white school was that she did not want her children to be afraid of white people. But I'm thinking, that's your problem. You're afraid of white people. We didn't get the opportunity to develop how we thought about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sasheer Zamata</h4><p begin="00:19:59.43" data-timestamp="1199.43">Did you ever talk to your mom about stuff she went through?

When I asked my mom why she never talked to me about this, she said she didn't want me to inherit her feelings about white people and she wanted me to come to my own conclusions. But the more questions I asked, especially about school, the more I felt like she didn't want to talk about it because it's still really painful to her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sasheer Zamata</h4><p begin="00:20:47.84" data-timestamp="1247.84">So then you were just thrust into this all-white environment?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ivory</h4><p begin="00:20:53.04" data-timestamp="1253.04">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sasheer Zamata</h4><p begin="00:20:54.83" data-timestamp="1254.83">What was your first day like?

And Mama had told us, sit in the front of the bus so in case something happens, the bus driver is a witness. Well, he was just a witness to us getting cussed out every day. He did nothing.</p><p begin="00:21:22.63" data-timestamp="1282.63">When we get off the bus, we stood outside the window of the office so if anything happened, then they could witness something happening to us. The person I remember standing in the window was Coach Collier, who later became the principal. So he witnessed the kids throwing rocks at us.</p><p begin="00:21:44.62" data-timestamp="1304.62">I remember I had on a white blouse, a houndstooth vest, and a black skirt, and had my cute little white bobby socks. And I remember looking down at my legs and how the rocks had pelted them. And one had broke blood.</p><p begin="00:22:02.38" data-timestamp="1322.38">And some kid, I guess he pulled out a banana.

<h3>Act Four: Old Age</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:42:07.02" data-timestamp="2527.02">Act Four: Old Age. So we begin when you're little. And there are things you do not know. You can't understand. And then you grow up, and you get it.</p><p begin="00:42:17.07" data-timestamp="2537.07">We fall in love. This is love. Or someone tells you what "hooker" means. I remember that vividly. Stuff eventually makes sense.</p><p begin="00:42:28.81" data-timestamp="2548.81">This last story, it's about what happens after that, long after that. It's about a man named Carl Duzen. Carl was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a year and a half ago at age 79. So after decades of adulthood, it is suddenly appropriate for a 40-year-old doctor to ask him questions like, can you tell me who the president is? Or, do you remember your name?</p><p begin="00:42:52.49" data-timestamp="2572.49">When Carl goes to the doctor, he always goes with his wife Susan. He always hates going. And he always knows his name.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:43:00.91" data-timestamp="2580.91">So one of the questions that you should always ask, make a picture, basically, of a clock at such and such a time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:14.28" data-timestamp="2594.28">It says in words "draw a clock"?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:43:16.30" data-timestamp="2596.3">Yes, the round face.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:17.47" data-timestamp="2597.47">I see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:43:17.92" data-timestamp="2597.92">Could you draw an analog clock with the time 11:20?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:22.98" data-timestamp="2602.98">Susan, Carl's wife, tells me one day recently, she drove Carl to his appointment. Carl went in. And Carl tells me he waited there, pencil in hand, the tester waiting next to him, asking him, "draw a clock."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:43:38.96" data-timestamp="2618.96">So I got a piece of paper. No matter what I-- I just-- I couldn't-- I couldn't do it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:43:51.25" data-timestamp="2631.25">Carl tried again. He looked up at the tester, back down toward his page. Tester, his pencil.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:43:58.77" data-timestamp="2638.77">So, look at that and yeah, I can't do it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:05.52" data-timestamp="2645.52">He can't do it. Carl got a graduate degree in physics. He studied motion, electromagnetism. He spent a lot of his life deep in the study of space and time of numbers. He taught physics and mathematics for years. So this particular failing was unnerving.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:44:29.08" data-timestamp="2669.08">Why is this so difficult? Why is that so hard? It's clocks. Why is that so hard?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:44:36.46" data-timestamp="2676.46">When Carl talks, his wife Susan is completely still, listening, hanging on the details so she doesn't miss anything, jumping in with words when they're needed. She's a full head taller than Carl. Their favorite joke, as Susan says, I almost overlooked him. And then he jumps in the air so she can see his face.</p><p begin="00:44:55.34" data-timestamp="2695.34">When Carl says things lately that don't have much basis in reality, Susan respectfully raises two questioning eyebrows, leaves it at that. As he's describing the trouble of the clock, Susan assures Carl he's not alone. The clock thing comes up in her support group for spouses of people with dementia.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:45:15.28" data-timestamp="2715.28">In the support group, people would talk about how, oh, my husband has an appointment next week with the doctor. So he's been busy practicing the clock. Oh, yeah, the clock. Oh, my husband never gets it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:45:27.87" data-timestamp="2727.87">Well, because it's so universal. There it is.</p><p begin="00:45:30.96" data-timestamp="2730.96">[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:45:32.06" data-timestamp="2732.06">It's the time. And now suddenly, you can't manage it. Ack.</p><p begin="00:45:46.38" data-timestamp="2746.38">And so, I just said, OK. So what I did is got a piece of paper. I just sat down. Where is it? Let's--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:45:53.65" data-timestamp="2753.65">Do you want me to follow you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:45:55.32" data-timestamp="2755.32">No, I'll bring it. I'll bring it back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:45:57.19" data-timestamp="2757.19">Carl starts looking around for something. Goes in the kitchen. He seems to be lost. And then goes upstairs. Eventually, he comes down with a wooden box. Inside, it's felted with drafting tools.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:46:10.65" data-timestamp="2770.65">What do you have there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:46:11.50" data-timestamp="2771.5">So, I got a piece of paper. I got out the tool that I have for doing this kind of work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:46:20.97" data-timestamp="2780.97">So that's like a compass? It looks like the sort of compass I used in math in elementary school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:46:26.13" data-timestamp="2786.13">Yeah. Yeah. So I thought, OK, I'm going to-- I sat down with it for just about an hour.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:46:35.34" data-timestamp="2795.34">To be clear, not necessarily to draw a clock, but to figure out why he couldn't draw a clock.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:46:41.78" data-timestamp="2801.78">And I finally realized that the problem is superposition of three--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:46:52.96" data-timestamp="2812.96">Types.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:46:53.39" data-timestamp="2813.39">--types.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:46:55.20" data-timestamp="2815.2">Carl has drawn a very precise circle, split it into twelfths, and scrawled the words "superposition of three types" in tiny letters in the corner of the page. He explains, with Susan's help, there are three layers of information here. There's the hours that are represented from 1 through 12, even though there are 24 hours in a day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:47:18.03" data-timestamp="2838.03">But then, there's the second layer, which is the minutes. And a 1 represents not a 1 anymore, but 5 minutes. And a 2 represents 10.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:30.98" data-timestamp="2850.98">But Carl adds, after that layer is the second hand, which is now measuring 1 through 60 seconds.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:38.20" data-timestamp="2858.2">Superposition of three types.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:47:40.10" data-timestamp="2860.1">Types because you have three different elevations that you have to get together to make the information.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:47:50.53" data-timestamp="2870.53">Carl sat with his tools and his paper and his physicist's desire to decompose the problem before him. And he took apart each element of the clock until it made sense to him, the three layers, the fact that the eye goes to the larger minute hand first and your brain has to override that to focus on the smaller hour hand, which is actually more important even though it's smaller and not the first thing you see.</p><p begin="00:48:15.68" data-timestamp="2895.68">And then you're supposed to move to the longer minute hand. But don't be tricked because the second hand is also longer but it's skinnier. And by the end of all this, I just feel like, what the hell, clock? I can't believe this is the system we have for telling time. It's insane. It's a miracle anyone can ever just glance at their wrist and capture information, something Carl works very hard at.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:48:42.48" data-timestamp="2922.48">So and the brain-- the brain is in there trying desperately, of course, to get hold all of these things at the same time to respond to. And it's just dead hard. And then when I did this I figured, oh, that's why it's so hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:49:06.21" data-timestamp="2946.21">Your brain can't help you draw a clock, but you used your brain to figure out why your brain can't help you draw a clock.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:49:13.92" data-timestamp="2953.92">Yeah, that's kind of the way it is. I felt like that I got something back that I had lost. But not that I could do it easily for a while, but that I at least understood why I have was having trouble.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:49:33.46" data-timestamp="2973.46">And that felt like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:49:34.44" data-timestamp="2974.44">And that had-- it had meaning. And it had the structure.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:49:38.98" data-timestamp="2978.98">Instead of just feeling like this is a random thing that I now suddenly can't do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:49:44.15" data-timestamp="2984.15">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:49:44.64" data-timestamp="2984.64">Huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:49:46.13" data-timestamp="2986.13">And it isn't easy. It is difficult. And so I felt better about myself. Got perky. More perky.</p><p begin="00:49:56.91" data-timestamp="2996.91">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:49:58.87" data-timestamp="2998.87"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:50:06.72" data-timestamp="3006.72">A dementia diagnosis is being told you are now no longer going to understand things as you get older. For the first time in your life, the chronological forward march of knowledge will begin to reverse itself. But Carl is understanding things he never knew before. And this is the case with lots of people with dementia.</p><p begin="00:50:27.62" data-timestamp="3027.62">Through meeting Carl and other people, I talked to a woman who forgot how to make coffee. And then she broke down the steps involved so she could do it again. A guy who re-learned to use his cell phone. That's something Carl has also done.</p><p begin="00:50:41.36" data-timestamp="3041.36">Carl knows way more about a clock than most of us only because he forgot how to draw one. You learn what you need to know when you need to know it. Carl tells me proudly now that he understands the superposition of three types, he can use that to read a watch again. Susan raises her eyebrows skeptically at this, but says nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:51:03.40" data-timestamp="3063.4">From the time that I was told that I had Alzheimer's to now, the things that I had let go of because kinds of things in physics that I used to teach I can't even tell you what it is. That's gone. For a while, I couldn't use my computer, remember how to use it. And now I can go with a clock--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:51:40.88" data-timestamp="3100.88">Watch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:51:41.32" data-timestamp="3101.32">Watch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:51:43.74" data-timestamp="3103.74">Can you tell the time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:51:45.13" data-timestamp="3105.13">On this one, it's really tough. But here it is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:51:46.99" data-timestamp="3106.99">You want to look at mine?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:51:47.49" data-timestamp="3107.49">[INAUDIBLE] OK, here's where it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan</h4><p begin="00:51:51.38" data-timestamp="3111.38">Here, Carl, look at mine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:51:53.65" data-timestamp="3113.65">OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:51:54.69" data-timestamp="3114.69">Carl's wearing a watch, but it's small. And he doesn't seem to know how to deal with the fact that it's covered by part of his sleeve. Susan pulls out her gold watch, which has a much larger face.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:52:05.58" data-timestamp="3125.58">OK. So you're looking around for information. You would go for this because that's the most important thing. It looks like it. It's the biggest one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:16.41" data-timestamp="3136.41">You're pointing to the second hand.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:52:18.79" data-timestamp="3138.79">Yes.

It's the smallest little thing. It's that little piece, you see? And that's the hour one. That's the one, hour by hour, that does the whole thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-Walt</h4><p begin="00:52:40.44" data-timestamp="3160.44">You have to think through each of those steps every time you look at a watch?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:52:44.55" data-timestamp="3164.55">OK, so this is-- well, here we are with the little piece.

Susan looks very nervous. We are all leaning in. Later, I will realize that here is where I stopped breathing. Carl spends a while on that hour hand and then starts counting by fives in a whisper around the face of the watch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carl Duzen</h4><p begin="00:53:12.20" data-timestamp="3192.2">5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. 1:40?
