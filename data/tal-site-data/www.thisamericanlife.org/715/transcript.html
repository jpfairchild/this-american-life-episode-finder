<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.13" data-timestamp="1.13"> Remember years ago, the guy who ran the military, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, said, kind of famously, there are the things we know, the things we don't know, and there are the things that we don't even know we don't know. That last kind of spooky category he called the unknown unknowns.</p><p begin="00:00:20.73" data-timestamp="20.73">And I guess maybe talking about known unknowns and unknown unknowns might have been appropriate for the thing he was talking about, which was Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. But who knew that someday it was going to be a good way to describe the chaos swirling this year around two of which should be the most pedestrian, predictable things the government does-- counting votes in an election and starting the school year.</p><p begin="00:00:44.76" data-timestamp="44.76">OK, let's save the election for another day. Can we talk right now about the demolition derby multi-car pileup of known unknowns and unknown unknowns that is the opening of this school year? Matt teaches at a big high school in the suburbs of South Carolina. And all summer he's been doing what parents and teachers everywhere have been doing this year, wondering if there's going to be in-person instruction this fall and watching state and local officials give out information that seemed incomplete, and contradictory, and confusing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:01:11.90" data-timestamp="71.9"> And it was sort of like hot potato of responsibility too. It was like everybody was kind of passing, you know, like, when you hear from your district, when you hear from the state superintendent, when we hear from our gov-- you know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:22.24" data-timestamp="82.24"> Oh, they're all saying somebody else is going to set the course, and then you'll know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:01:25.78" data-timestamp="85.78"> Yeah, it felt very deflective.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:29.39" data-timestamp="89.39"> By August, when they got to the first day, the teachers reported back to school-- no kids there yet, just teachers. Matt says things still seemed very unclear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:01:37.66" data-timestamp="97.66"> Thinking surely when we get in the building, we're going to get the answers. The answer is in the building where my bosses are, they're going to know. And over the course of the week, sort of having the veil lifted and realizing my bosses don't know anything more than I do about the start of school-- like, my principal and I know the exact same amount of information.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:01.52" data-timestamp="121.52"> At that point, teachers had received an email with a tentative plan, but the emphasis was very much on "tentative." His principal noted, quote, "Things change daily." The plan was called the A/B plan, and it was the hybrid plan that lots of schools are doing.</p><p begin="00:02:15.03" data-timestamp="135.03">Students will be divided into two groups, A and B. Half would come to school for two days while the other half would stay home and join online using Zoom, then they'd switch. But if you want to see a high school spinning through the maelstrom of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, OK, here is what happened that first day the teachers came back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:02:33.93" data-timestamp="153.93"> The first meeting that I go to is at 10:00. And it's a department meeting, so we have just 15 people spread out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:40.82" data-timestamp="160.82"> And you all are sitting there socially distanced from each other, wearing masks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:02:44.61" data-timestamp="164.61"> Yep. There's a good atmosphere in the room. All things considered, we're happy to be there and happy to see each other-- a very glass half full, whatever may come sort of vibe in the room. And our department head, who's a teacher, has written up these two plans on the board-- the A day, B day sort of hybrid plan and then an all-virtual start.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:07.91" data-timestamp="187.91"> Virtual start-- no students in the building, you're teaching everybody online.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:03:10.90" data-timestamp="190.9"> Correct.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:11.37" data-timestamp="191.37"> Got it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:03:12.00" data-timestamp="192"> Yeah. We get a little into this meeting, and we have an administrator-- one of our assistant principals is in the room, and he's been mostly quiet. But when we get to a conversation about how we get back into teaching, he sort of pipes in, and he says, hang on. And he's like, the A day, B day plan is out. Apparently they had received word from the district that our school needed to cancel that plan. So, all right, everybody, first change, curve ball coming at 11:00 AM. Change of plans-- let's plan on all virtual.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:46.83" data-timestamp="226.83"> So to summarize, 10 o'clock it's A/B. 11 o'clock it's all virtual. Or anyway, that's how Matt took it. His department chair told us he had no idea what would happen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:04:01.79" data-timestamp="241.79"> So meeting ends. Then around 2:00 in the afternoon, word sort of spreads that there's this bomb drop of an announcement. And that administrator who had been in our meeting caught my colleague in the hall, and he was kind of flustered. And he said, plans are changing again. We just got word from the district. So it's just like, wait for the staff meeting. Let's see what happens.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:32.14" data-timestamp="272.14"> The staff meeting is the big welcome to the new school year all staff meeting for the whole faculty. And it starts at 3 o'clock.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:04:38.90" data-timestamp="278.9"> About 250 teachers are on this Zoom call. We're all in our own rooms.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:42.82" data-timestamp="282.82"> You're all in the building, but you're in your own rooms--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:04:44.74" data-timestamp="284.74"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:44.95" data-timestamp="284.95"> --on Zoom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:04:45.33" data-timestamp="285.33"> Yeah. And then like nothing happens at this meeting. The whole meeting is trivial information. They introduce new faculty members. They share positive news from teachers' summers, like new babies or engagements. They talk about our SAT scores from last year, all the things that we hear annually.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:04.37" data-timestamp="304.37"> When they finally do talk about the restart plan, he says it's a lot of we can do it positivity, but no concrete details about whether they'd be going all virtual or what the plan was going to be.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:05:14.50" data-timestamp="314.5"> So the meeting ends, and we're all sort of sitting there thinking like, what was it? And my colleague and I are determined to figure this out. So it's 4:00 now. We're like, we're going to go down to the administrators' offices and just see what we can see.</p><p begin="00:05:30.22" data-timestamp="330.22">And we go to one of the administrator's offices, and there are two other assistant principals in there. It's pretty jammed. And it's sort of like the situation room in any White House action drama. There's papers all over the table, and everybody's on their computer. And even for as few people are in the room, they're sort of talking past each other, and there are multiple conversations going on.</p><p begin="00:05:56.17" data-timestamp="356.17">And my friend and I kind of got that vibe of like, we're just going to stand at the door. We're not even going to come in, wade into the water. But what we find out is that in the afternoon, the district apparently came back to the schools and was like, OK, new plan. You need students in the building on the first day of school, five days a week, at 25% capacity. That's all we're giving you. Figure it out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:26.86" data-timestamp="386.86"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:06:27.01" data-timestamp="387.01"> And so what we see on the table are all these rosters of students and scheduling. And so there's some logistical nightmare.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:35.53" data-timestamp="395.53"> The logistical nightmare is because South Carolina mandates that every parent should have the option to send their kid to school for in-person instruction if they want or keep them at home for virtual learning if that's what they want, which is the kind of trying to please everybody solution that in practice is just enormously difficult to execute.</p><p begin="00:06:51.88" data-timestamp="411.88">It means that there have to be some students in school five days a week. But, of course, there's only so much space in the school for students with proper social distancing. So how do you figure out who gets to attend and who does not get to attend, and what happens when you cannot give every family what it wants?</p><p begin="00:07:09.16" data-timestamp="429.16">Meanwhile in the classrooms, as South Carolina heads towards the first day of classes September 8, teachers have to figure out how to do something that they did not do last spring when schools went on quarantine. They had to figure out, how do you teach a class that is partly at home and partly in the room with you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:07:24.19" data-timestamp="444.19"> Which is a particularly-- it's particularly funny to think for choir, it's a very difficult subject to teach virtually.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:34.65" data-timestamp="454.65"> Oh, Matt, he's a choir teacher.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:07:37.29" data-timestamp="457.29"> Trying to sing in a Zoom with other people is just a nightmare, because you can't even-- if you say let's clap at the same time, you'll hear a bunch of different claps because everybody's--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:49.66" data-timestamp="469.66"> Oh, of course. There's a little delay, and that delay makes it impossible to sing together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:07:54.81" data-timestamp="474.81"> Yeah, not to mention that usually the software is built to identify who is speaking and amplify their voice, and silence other people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:04.96" data-timestamp="484.96"> So the only way to sing together is with everybody on mute, and what kind of rehearsal is that? And the one fourth of the class that's going to be in the room with him, they can't sing together in the room because singing in a chorus can be a super spreader event for the virus. Remember that choir near Seattle at the beginning of the pandemic where 52 people got sick? Even with masks it's not safe, which means singing together is the one thing you cannot do in chorus.</p><p begin="00:08:30.62" data-timestamp="510.62">Matt's classes are 90 minutes long, and right now he figures he'll teach the kids on Zoom and the kids in the classroom together for half an hour at the beginning of it, lecture style, give out singing assignments to do at home--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:08:41.40" data-timestamp="521.4"> And then at the 30-minute mark or something, I would probably dismiss those Zoom students, say, like, OK, you've got your assignments. I'll see you soon-- take the students that are in the room somewhere outside where we can be spaced out and actually practice singing with them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:58.23" data-timestamp="538.23"> Weather permitting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:08:59.82" data-timestamp="539.82"> Yeah. We're going to have to just MacGyver the whole semester basically.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:05.34" data-timestamp="545.34"> So you're re-engineering every part of your job? Like, every single part of it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:09:09.33" data-timestamp="549.33"> Exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:11.07" data-timestamp="551.07"> Other teachers have said this to me too, that virtual teaching is making them rethink and re-engineer the most basic things they do in their jobs to get through to kids. A second grade teacher in Chicago told me that she was still struggling to figure out how she was going to hold the attention of a bunch of seven-year-olds over video for the mandated three hours a day of live, real-time instruction.</p><p begin="00:09:30.87" data-timestamp="570.87">She was like, I don't even know if developmentally, that's even possible for them to focus on the screen for that long. Not to mention, what activities was she going to give these little kids to do on their own, unsupervised by her, for the hours they would not be on video with her? She was spending weeks before school started, every day on her own time, unpaid to figure this out.</p><p begin="00:09:58.93" data-timestamp="598.93">It's been a few days since I've recorded that conversation with Matt. And since then, his high school surveyed the teachers and realized that so many of them wanted to stay home and teach from home that there's no way they could actually have 25% of the students come back for in-person instruction. Right now it seems like they're only going to have enough instructors for fewer than 10% of the students. But administrators are still figuring it out.</p><p begin="00:10:20.06" data-timestamp="620.06">And of course, who knows how everything is going to unfold in September when kids actually arrive. Will anybody get COVID? Will things be fine? Matt knows some teachers in states where school has already started.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:10:30.89" data-timestamp="630.89"> What it feels like right now is going cliff jumping with your friends. And our friends next to us are Georgia and Alabama. And we're like, 1, 2, 3-- and we're like, I'll see you in four weeks, as they're jumping off. Because we want to see what happens to the other districts. I'm starting to see-- I have friends in Louisiana that are teaching entirely virtually.

And with them, do you let them know your apprehensions? Or do you just keep like a big smiley face, and, like, it's going to be great? Do you feel like you're lying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt</h4><p begin="00:11:21.45" data-timestamp="681.45"> [LAUGHS] Yeah, it sort of feels-- it feels a little contorted. Like, I have teachers that are posting first day of school pictures as always. And they sound bright and cheery. And it's like, can't wait to see my students, despite the challenges. Really excited to show them a great new year.</p><p begin="00:11:45.29" data-timestamp="705.29">But underneath the surface, these teachers are my friends, and I know these teachers are terrified. And it feels twisted this year because we really don't know what our safety looks like and what our students' safety looks like, but you still have to be the boss in front of the class and be like-- [CLAPS] --what's up, y'all? So excited you're here. Let's go. I am going to put my best foot forward because I can't wait to teach kids, and I love doing that, but I'm scared [BLEEP] -less about what the year looks like.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:24.87" data-timestamp="744.87"> From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Today on our program, teachers, students, parents launch themselves into a school year that is beginning like none that any of us have ever experienced.

<h3>Act One: Masked Crusaders</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:09.35" data-timestamp="789.35"> Act One, Masked Crusaders. So right before school started in Utah this month, our producer Miki Meek caught up with two high school teachers. Clark is 33. Bayley's 26. They're married, and we agreed not to use their last names. They joke that their pillow talk is reviewing each other's lessons for the next day.</p><p begin="00:13:27.20" data-timestamp="807.2">Clark teaches art and photography. This year's his sixth year as a teacher. Bayley's a newbie, about to have her own classroom for the very first time, teaching sophomore English. The two of them teach at different public high schools in Utah County, south of Salt Lake City. And they found themselves thrown into this really heated and ugly fight in the county right before schools open back up. Here's Miki.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:13:51.80" data-timestamp="831.8"> Clark and Bayley are still these fresh-faced, enthusiastic teachers, but they spent the summer stressing about their schools reopening because COVID cases had started surging in Utah. Both of them would have classes with as many as 40 students in them. Their classrooms are too small to space desks six feet apart. And the windows, they don't open.</p><p begin="00:14:10.99" data-timestamp="850.99">Governor Gary Herbert issued a mask mandate for all K through 12 schools, which made them feel a little better, until a county commissioner, a guy named Bill Lee, he started lobbying against it. He thought it should be up to parents whether their kids wear a mask. He called it a, quote, "compassionate exemption."</p><p begin="00:14:28.69" data-timestamp="868.69">To try to drum up support, he invited parents to the commission's next meeting. Suddenly you were either pro-mask or anti-mask. Clark and Bayley decided to go in support of masks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:14:39.46" data-timestamp="879.46"> But going into it I was like, is anyone really going to be there? Like, who's going to go to protest masks? I just thought, are there going to be 10 people there? I have no idea.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:14:51.97" data-timestamp="891.97"> There were actually around 100 people there. The meeting was held at the county building in Provo. And when Clark and Bayley got there, they saw mostly moms gathered outside, some with kids. Hardly anyone was wearing a mask. But one family who was wearing masks stopped Bayley.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:15:07.78" data-timestamp="907.78"> They were like, you should go in, because there's like no one really in support of masks. And so I was like, OK, I'm going in. And I just kind of ran in the building.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:18.38" data-timestamp="918.38"> It was packed. There were chairs set up with tape across them for social distancing, but that didn't work so well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:15:24.13" data-timestamp="924.13"> People were just peeling off the tape and sitting down. And people were just riled up. You could feel this energy that was really intense.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:15:33.89" data-timestamp="933.89"> And just wearing a mask in that space put a target on your head immediately.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:15:37.96" data-timestamp="937.96"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:39.31" data-timestamp="939.31"> The room was hot and crowded, and a bunch of people without masks were fanning their faces.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tanner Ainge</h4><p begin="00:15:43.27" data-timestamp="943.27"> And we're good to go. All right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:15:47.14" data-timestamp="947.14"> That's a county commissioner named Tanner Ainge. He was not happy about this meeting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tanner Ainge</h4><p begin="00:15:51.61" data-timestamp="951.61"> Hello, everyone. This is going to be brief, I think. This is the exact opposite of what we need to be doing. We are supposed to be physically distancing, wearing masks.</p><p begin="00:16:06.83" data-timestamp="966.83">[BOOING]</p><p begin="00:16:07.82" data-timestamp="967.82">And so--</p><p begin="00:16:08.47" data-timestamp="968.47">[BOOING]</p><p begin="00:16:09.89" data-timestamp="969.89">--all of our medical--</p><p begin="00:16:10.88" data-timestamp="970.88">[BOOING]</p><p begin="00:16:13.97" data-timestamp="973.97">All of our medical experts--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:16:15.65" data-timestamp="975.65"> Let him talk!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tanner Ainge</h4><p begin="00:16:17.09" data-timestamp="977.09"> Our department of health--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:16:18.17" data-timestamp="978.17"> You've already made your decision?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tanner Ainge</h4><p begin="00:16:20.00" data-timestamp="980"> Everyone is encouraging us to do that.

People in the crowd call him a coward.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:16:45.34" data-timestamp="1005.34"> Yeah, Tanner is a coward.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:16:47.12" data-timestamp="1007.12"> And then--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Crowd</h4><p begin="00:16:47.81" data-timestamp="1007.81"> USA! USA! USA!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:16:51.41" data-timestamp="1011.41"> Ainge later tweeted, "This is not a <i>Parks</i> <i>and</i> <i>Rec</i> episode. It's Utah County government." To him, this whole thing was just a political stunt. The county commission has no jurisdiction over school districts. They don't make decisions for them. It'd be like the sheriff's department holding a meeting to vote on the school budget. It didn't make any sense.</p><p begin="00:17:10.22" data-timestamp="1030.22">But Billy, the guy who wanted the governor to give the county a compassionate exemption from wearing masks, and another commissioner, they agreed to stay behind to listen to any parent who wanted to make a comment. Again, here's Bayley.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:17:22.79" data-timestamp="1042.79"> At that point, when I realized that people were going to be making comments, I kind of pushed my way into the room because I wanted to make a comment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:17:29.99" data-timestamp="1049.99"> She got in line for the podium. There were around 12 people ahead of her, even more behind her, mostly moms. One of them had a baby carrier strapped to her chest. I watched this meeting on a Facebook livestream.</p><p begin="00:17:40.82" data-timestamp="1060.82">Most of the speakers accepted that COVID is real. They didn't think it's a hoax. They supported hand washing and staying at home if you're sick. But they didn't trust the CDC, and in general all the precautions seemed overblown.</p><p begin="00:17:53.60" data-timestamp="1073.6">Some sounded like libertarians. There were tons of conspiracy theories. Like that mom with the baby, she said this thing I heard a lot of parents there say, that CO2 and germs can get trapped in your mask and make you sick, which is totally false.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:18:07.31" data-timestamp="1087.31"> You want our kids to breathe their own CO2?</p><p begin="00:18:10.71" data-timestamp="1090.71">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:18:12.18" data-timestamp="1092.18"> That's right!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:18:13.66" data-timestamp="1093.66"> Do you really think it's good to breathe in your own germs for hours?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:18:19.24" data-timestamp="1099.24"> She's saying, do you really think it's good to breathe in your own germs for hours?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:18:23.49" data-timestamp="1103.49"> Amen, sister.</p><p begin="00:18:24.85" data-timestamp="1104.85">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:18:27.14" data-timestamp="1107.14"> This myth has taken off in parent groups all over the country. The American Academy of Pediatrics even put out a statement to try and dispel it. And another conspiracy theory at this meeting, that mask mandates will lead to more kids getting abducted and sex trafficked-- also not true. The fear is that if kids are wearing masks, they'll be harder to identify and rescue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:18:46.97" data-timestamp="1126.97"> Those numbers will continue to rise because of a world are at home and online all day and being masked. It's a pedophile's dream come true.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:18:56.66" data-timestamp="1136.66"> Thomas Jefferson also kept coming up in this pretty ironic way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:19:00.33" data-timestamp="1140.33"> I got on my Facebook page. Thomas Jefferson said, I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. I will never be a slave, no matter what it takes. Give me liberty, or give me death. I mean that. I will do whatever it takes to have liberty. Thank you.</p><p begin="00:19:21.59" data-timestamp="1161.59">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:19:24.56" data-timestamp="1164.56"> Listening to all these parents, Bayley and Clark were alarmed, worried that they might have to face classes of 40 kids who were going to fight with them about wearing masks. So Bayley, she got up to the mic. She was sweaty and nervous, but fired up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:19:36.89" data-timestamp="1176.89"> My name is Bayley. I'm experiencing fear and anxiety about many things.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:19:41.66" data-timestamp="1181.66"> She tells the crowd she's a first-year teacher who's already juggling a lot of anxiety, and she's scared that she'll get COVID in her classroom. The crowd turns on her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:19:49.79" data-timestamp="1189.79"> Wearing a mask is a minor inconvenience, if you can even call it that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:19:54.80" data-timestamp="1194.8"> Who says?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:19:55.73" data-timestamp="1195.73"> Sh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:19:56.66" data-timestamp="1196.66"> That's Clark, doing some very teacher-like shushing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:19:59.27" data-timestamp="1199.27"> Hey!

Be quiet. Shut up. Listen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:20:14.66" data-timestamp="1214.66"> It's like this for five minutes, and then Bayley finally ends her speech and takes a little bow.</p><p begin="00:20:19.95" data-timestamp="1219.95">[BOOING]</p><p begin="00:20:21.85" data-timestamp="1221.85"></p><p begin="00:20:23.75" data-timestamp="1223.75">On their way out of the meeting, Clark, feeling sheepish, apologizes to the people that he told to shut up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:20:28.40" data-timestamp="1228.4"> That was my wife out there... I'm sorry. Thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:20:33.97" data-timestamp="1233.97"> I've never been booed before. It was just wild to be surrounded by so many grown adults who were shouting at me, calling me names. It was like, whoa. Also re-watching the video, I realized that I kind of did, like, a little bow after my comments, which is kind of embarrassing now. But it was just like-- it felt like such an outrageous experience, and it was almost comical.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:21:03.98" data-timestamp="1263.98"> But Bayley was also sympathetic to the parents in that room. She thought a lot of their hostility was coming from a place of fear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:21:10.04" data-timestamp="1270.04"> You know, like not wanting kids to have to be in schools where things feel very dystopian and like this fear that having to be masked is going to scare their children or something like that or impact them negatively. I feel like those are reasonable points in some ways, but also not at the same time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:21:40.77" data-timestamp="1300.77"> I grew up in Utah County. I still have a lot of friends and family there. So I feel pretty safe betting that most of the people in that meeting were Mormon. The majority of the county belongs to the church.</p><p begin="00:21:51.06" data-timestamp="1311.06">But watching that meeting, I saw something I didn't recognize-- Mormons yelling at other Mormons with total vitriol. Bayley and Clark said they felt the same. They're from the area too. By the way, I know we're not supposed to say Mormon anymore. We're supposed to say Latter-day Saint. But I just don't actually know that many Mormons who use that with each other.</p><p begin="00:22:09.60" data-timestamp="1329.6">Anyway, right after Utah's Republican Governor Gary Herbert issued his mask mandate, church leadership in the state backed him up. They asked Mormons to wear face coverings in public, calling it a sign of good citizenship. Immediately there was pushback. I saw comments online about corruption and false prophets in the church. That was mind-blowing. It's not like members never speak out against the church. It's just that I haven't seen it done so casually.</p><p begin="00:22:35.61" data-timestamp="1355.61">Pro-mask people were called maskers and mask-holes. Governor Herbert called the parents who went to that county meeting foolish, and he refused to back down from his mask mandate, which just enraged the anti-mask movement in Utah County even more. They held another rally and told parents to tell their kids to fight back against their teachers.</p><p begin="00:22:55.47" data-timestamp="1375.47">Bayley and Clark wondered how widespread the feeling was and worried that some of the parents or fellow teachers at her new school would recognize Bayley from the county meeting and think she was a crazy radical. Video had hit local news, and it was a big deal.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:23:08.94" data-timestamp="1388.94"> Have you thought about what you're going to say in your classes on the first day, anticipating you might have kids who come from families that share some of the same beliefs of the people who were at the county meeting?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:23:18.48" data-timestamp="1398.48"> I really don't know what I'm going to say or how I'm going to approach that conversation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:23:21.51" data-timestamp="1401.51"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:23:21.97" data-timestamp="1401.97"> We really don't know what this is going to look like when the school year actually starts.

And I think there was a couple that was making out in the corner of my classroom-- just so much touching.</p><p begin="00:24:49.38" data-timestamp="1489.38">And so I'm hoping students will wear masks today. I'm hoping I won't have any major conflicts with students as they come in.

[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:25:38.52" data-timestamp="1538.52"> This is awkward. In a class of 36 kids, only a few of them raise their hands. He had never taught a class that was so quiet and somber.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:25:47.10" data-timestamp="1547.1"> Raise your hand if you're just kind of like stressed and sad. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Few of you. Is anybody feeling anxious about wearing masks or feeling bummed about wearing masks? A little bit?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:25:58.45" data-timestamp="1558.45"> I'm bummed about wearing masks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:25:59.51" data-timestamp="1559.51"> Yeah, tell me more. You're bummed about wearing masks? It sucks? Tell me more. Why does it suck?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:26:04.07" data-timestamp="1564.07"> I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:26:05.34" data-timestamp="1565.34"> The student says, I don't know. I just don't feel like it sometimes. And then, my dad talks about it all the time. It's just to make people feel better. Clark responds deftly by first trying to validate the student.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:26:17.22" data-timestamp="1577.22"> Yeah, I mean, from a medical standpoint masks are definitely not perfect. If we really wanted to prevent every single germ, we'd have to wear full hazmat suits. We'd have to be in a controlled environment. So masks are not 100% effective. However, they are effective in stopping the spread or slowing the spread of these.</p><p begin="00:26:40.37" data-timestamp="1600.37">And so I know a lot of people are really, really frustrated about wearing masks because they're uncomfortable, and they make breathing hard, and blah, blah, blah. Even though they're not perfect, I think it's worth doing as a gesture of kindness toward people who might have more sensitive immune systems or might be more at risk. I was just barely talking with a student who lives with her grandma, and also works at a nursing home. And so she's trying to take every precaution to make sure that she doesn't get sick. So there are a lot of situations like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:27:10.98" data-timestamp="1630.98"> Little by little, his class starts to open up. Clark keeps lobbing questions at them. Anybody here play sports? A football player tells the room that his whole team wears masks for games and practice. A girl says she hates it, that they make her glasses fog up. About 15 minutes into this conversation, Clark uses the tactic that didn't work with the parents at the county meeting. He tells them about his own anxiety.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:27:34.11" data-timestamp="1654.11"> That's been one of my anxieties coming back to school, is I don't want to have to tell somebody to wear a mask. You know? That feels stressful to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:27:41.58" data-timestamp="1661.58"> And the kids, they seem to get it. Clark has two other periods that day, and he starts each class with the same soapbox spiel. He never gets any push back. The kids all wear their masks, and nobody makes out.</p><p begin="00:27:54.73" data-timestamp="1674.73">After school, Clark and Bayley crash exhausted on their living room couch with their dog and debrief about how their first days went.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:28:01.54" data-timestamp="1681.54"> The hallways were just kind of the wild, wild West.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:28:04.01" data-timestamp="1684.01"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:28:04.27" data-timestamp="1684.27"> Like, anything went.

And then as they walk closer to me, I'd say, hey, masks. And they would say, oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot, and then hurry and put it back on. And they'd put it back on as they walked into my classroom. I mean, there's just no way that the hall monitors can see everything that's going on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:28:30.52" data-timestamp="1710.52"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark</h4><p begin="00:28:31.33" data-timestamp="1711.33"> When you talked about masks, how did you approach the mask conversation?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bayley</h4><p begin="00:28:35.77" data-timestamp="1715.77"> They walk in the door.

<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:53.45" data-timestamp="1913.45"> Act Two, Screen Times at Ridgemont High. So across the country right now, kids are facing the weird experience of getting to know new classes and new teachers, all through Zoom. It's especially intense for kids who are jumping into a new school.</p><p begin="00:32:08.32" data-timestamp="1928.32">Producer Aviva DeKornfeld talked to some students who are making the jump to high school this fall, and it is a big job, right? It's one that causes a lot of anxiety and excitement in normal times. Now, all of it happening online. One girl told Aviva that she'd already thought through how to make friends at her new school.</p><p begin="00:32:24.44" data-timestamp="1944.44">She said she had a plan to email kids to discuss homework, and then she would try to shift the conversation to other topics and see if they went there. And Aviva talked to this 15-year-old in Los Angeles, Alex Hymen, at the end of his very first day of high school about how he's prepped for remote learning with a bunch of kids that he doesn't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:32:43.67" data-timestamp="1963.67"> This week, I'm painting my room. I actually just finished this morning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:32:47.36" data-timestamp="1967.36"> Why are you painting your room?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:32:49.25" data-timestamp="1969.25"> Well, last year in the spring, when online school started in March or April, believe it or not, a lot of kids made comments on my bright, vibrant baby blue and orange room that I've had since when I was very young. And I thought it'd be cool to have a multicolored room, very bright.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:33:14.02" data-timestamp="1994.02"> What do kids say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:33:15.77" data-timestamp="1995.77"> They were just like, nice room. Like, oh, that's a very neutral color, just sarcastic comments like that. I mean, it's a very first-world problem that my room's not the right color.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:33:27.83" data-timestamp="2007.83"> How old were you when you first painted it, the bright colors?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:33:31.38" data-timestamp="2011.38"> I believe I was, like, seven, eight. I was like, yes, it's going to be so cool and awesome. And now here I'm 15, and now I just want a white room. Now, actually-- I just finished this morning. Now it's all the light gray I picked out, and I actually like it a lot. My mom was a little sad because I'm growing up, and she was upset about that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:33:51.16" data-timestamp="2031.16"> Oh. What did she say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:33:53.39" data-timestamp="2033.39"> I mean, she was like, I'm going to miss this room. Like, remember when you picked out the colors and--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:34:00.11" data-timestamp="2040.11"> Yeah. It's funny, your mom was upset that you're growing up.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:34:09.14" data-timestamp="2049.14"> So you were on Zoom calls today.

That probably didn't make any sense. What I'm trying to say is that I look at some of them, but I don't really analyze the rooms.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:34:51.86" data-timestamp="2091.86"> You didn't really pay much attention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:34:53.36" data-timestamp="2093.36"> Yeah, exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:34:54.71" data-timestamp="2094.71"> Looking at the other kids' rooms and realizing you don't actually really care about how they look, did it make you feel like it didn't matter if you had switched up your room or not?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:35:03.62" data-timestamp="2103.62"> Yeah, it actually did sort of.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:35:10.05" data-timestamp="2110.05"> What's the first thing you saw today at school?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:35:12.46" data-timestamp="2112.46"> I logged on, and it was our whole grade, so around a little less than 200. I'm not sure of the exact number. But yeah, it was a bunch of boxes. Most of the kids-- or I guess half the kids had their cameras on. Half had them off. I started with mine on and then turned it off, to be honest.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Aviva DeKornfeld</h4><p begin="00:35:31.08" data-timestamp="2131.08"> Really? Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Hymen</h4><p begin="00:35:33.15" data-timestamp="2133.15"> I guess it just-- a lot of other kids had it off, like most them towards the end.

Aviva's one of the producers of our show. Coming up, an elementary school that carefully did everything you could possibly do to prepare for students coming back.

You know, it's the one thing out of all those things that we knew would happen and had time to prepare for, and still it somehow feels like the whole summer has been an all-nighter for a test that we're having this fall, and lots of parents and educators are feeling very shaky about how the test is going to go.</p><p begin="00:36:50.90" data-timestamp="2210.9">How it is going is what we're documenting on today's show.

<h3>Act Three: Future Imperfect</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:55.28" data-timestamp="2215.28"> Act Three, Future Imperfect. This next story is from a high school in Tennessee, Maryville High School. This is one of the first in the country to open up. And it opened as cases were rising in the area.</p><p begin="00:37:07.67" data-timestamp="2227.67">On the COVID map that Harvard Global Health Institute maintains, the county is currently red as we get today's show on the air. Red, the institute says, means that they're at a tipping point for uncontrolled spread. That's exactly the kind of situation that lots of teachers around the country have been saying would keep them from returning to their classrooms. Maryville, however, has been at it for a month now.</p><p begin="00:37:28.78" data-timestamp="2248.78">So what's it like? How are they holding up? For a glimpse of the future that awaits many educators elsewhere, David Kestenbaum talked with a teacher named Stacey Travis.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:37:39.66" data-timestamp="2259.66"> Stacey is the kind of teacher people go to when they have problems. A lot of the time they're math problems. That's what she teaches. One of the days we talked, she got a call in the middle of the day from a kid who wasn't even in school that year. He'd graduated. He was in his dorm room in college.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:37:55.51" data-timestamp="2275.51"> And so I call him back, and he was like, I don't know how to solve this. And he shows me this paper. And I said, what class are you in? And he goes, freshman engineering. And I said, I taught you how to solve that. He goes, I know. That's why I called you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:38:10.83" data-timestamp="2290.83"> The decision to go back to school in the middle of a pandemic, it's a different kind of problem. Even before school opened, there were cases. Some kids couldn't come in on the first day because they tested positive. And she says a couple teachers have taken these extra precautions in their classrooms.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:38:25.98" data-timestamp="2305.98"> Like one has this-- it almost looks like the old-fashioned bathtubs with the ring around it with the curtain, and it goes all the way around their desk.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:38:34.59" data-timestamp="2314.59"> Wait, wait. So the teacher's desk is basically surrounded with, like, a shower curtain?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:38:39.52" data-timestamp="2319.52"> Clear shower curtain on PVC pipe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:38:42.69" data-timestamp="2322.69"> Even with all the masks and social distancing, Stacey says school feels kind of normal once the day gets started. But there's always this menace that feels just offstage. Since the high school opened, several students have tested positive. She gets an email every time. When we talked, she had one student out awaiting test results. It doesn't look like any of the students got the virus from school, but there has been one case in the district where it looks like a maintenance worker may have gotten COVID from a colleague.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:39:08.34" data-timestamp="2348.34"> There are moments that it worries me, and I can give you a specific example. I had a student ask for help. And I had my mask on. I have my mask on every time I walk up close to a student to offer help.</p><p begin="00:39:22.48" data-timestamp="2362.48">And he had his mask on, but had it below his nose. And I was writing on his desk, and we were talking through this problem. And I could feel his breath on my arm. And that kind of made me have a moment of, oh, my gosh, he's breathing on me. I can feel the breath coming out of his nose, onto my arm.</p><p begin="00:39:44.71" data-timestamp="2384.71">And after I finished helping him, which I do this after I help any kid at their desk, I sanitized my hands. But then I also have some spray sanitizer, and I just sprayed it down my arm. And I know it probably looked weird, and I wasn't trying to make him feel uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little bit better.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:04.85" data-timestamp="2404.85"> Do you think about the question of sort of risk with math ever--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:40:10.31" data-timestamp="2410.31"> [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:11.79" data-timestamp="2411.79"> --since you're a math person?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:40:14.49" data-timestamp="2414.49"> As the risk of me catching COVID--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:17.61" data-timestamp="2417.61"> Yeah.

You could do the numbers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:40:30.69" data-timestamp="2430.69"> Oh, yeah. I could definitely do the numbers. I don't let myself do the numbers, because I think I've just kind of realized that I'm probably going to get it. Either I'm going to get it from a student, or I'm going to get it from my kid who got it from another kid.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:48.48" data-timestamp="2448.48"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stacey Travis</h4><p begin="00:40:49.11" data-timestamp="2449.11"> Or I'm going to get it from my husband who got it from one of the workers on his job site.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:40:53.61" data-timestamp="2453.61"> What do you think about that?

There are moments that I wonder, if I do get it, what's going to happen to my kids? Of course there's moments like that. I don't know.

If your last name begins with a letter between A and K, you come in Monday and Wednesday. On Tuesday and Thursday, you join the class by Zoom from home.

<h3>Act Four: The Case of the Well-Prepared Elementary School</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:05.68" data-timestamp="2645.68"> Act Four, The Case of the Well-Prepared Elementary School. So next, we go to a school that was remarkably ready for the first day, Tindley Summit Academy in Indianapolis. It's an elementary school, a charter school, pretty small, fewer than 300 students. And it was set up especially well to roll out all the new COVID safety precautions and procedures, because like lots of charter schools the whole philosophy of the school, from the kids all the way up to the principal, is very regimented. Kids walk silently in the hallways. There's a strict dress code, super involved teacher trainings.</p><p begin="00:44:39.18" data-timestamp="2679.18">But even a place that could prepare so well, something big happened that first day that nobody saw coming. Stephanie Wang reports for a website that covers education that I am a fan of. It's called Chalk Beat. And for a month she watched Tindley Summit prepare for their reopening and then was there when the kids finally showed up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:44:56.75" data-timestamp="2696.75"> Tindley Summit started the year with two weeks of online learning, but this is the moment everyone's been waiting for, the first day children are allowed back into the building for in-person instruction.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:45:06.96" data-timestamp="2706.96"> Good morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:45:07.41" data-timestamp="2707.41"> Good morning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:45:08.88" data-timestamp="2708.88"> It's 7:30 in the morning, and parents are already lining up in the parking lot.

But Mr. McGuire is one of the most optimistic people I've ever interviewed. He doesn't like to worry or even use the word "worry." At one point when we're talking, he calls it the W word.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Mcguire</h4><p begin="00:46:07.56" data-timestamp="2767.56"> I feel confident with our plan. And again, maybe day one we see how the plan goes.

And as we're standing there, we watch how a mom named Pam Lee navigates that new reality. She's walking her sixth grader Nysia and kindergartner Ny'asia up to the door. It's Ny'asia's first in-person day of kindergarten.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pam Lee</h4><p begin="00:46:39.25" data-timestamp="2799.25"> Ny'asia.

All that planning is paying off. Mr. McGuire and I speed walk through the school, and we see kids patiently waiting to use the bathroom, where they're only allowed to use every other stall to maintain space.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:47:38.11" data-timestamp="2858.11"> We're figuring that out for tomorrow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:47:39.76" data-timestamp="2859.76"> He points out a sixth grade class reading <i>The</i> <i>Outsiders</i> at their desks that have shields set up on them, like little cubicles. The kids don't even fuss that much about wearing their masks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher</h4><p begin="00:47:48.70" data-timestamp="2868.7"> When I sat down to the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:47:51.94" data-timestamp="2871.94"> It seems like a smooth start to being back in school, except for one thing. As we pass by a second grade classroom, we both notice that there's only a single kid in it. Mr. McGuire kind of breezes by, continuing to walk and point out other classrooms. But I stop and make him come back. The second grader is sitting in the middle of the room, looking lonely and small behind rows of cubicle desks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:48:14.03" data-timestamp="2894.03"> Just one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Mcguire</h4><p begin="00:48:14.84" data-timestamp="2894.84"> Huh?

Yeah, so, again, that--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:48:21.19" data-timestamp="2901.19"> We continue down the hall. Other classrooms also have way too many empty desks. On the first day back, a lot of kids are missing.</p><p begin="00:48:37.13" data-timestamp="2917.13">226 kids were supposed to show up for school today. Another 45 signed up to stay virtual. Just after 9:00 AM, David and the two assistant principals get the actual attendance number from the school counselor in the hallway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Mcguire</h4><p begin="00:48:50.37" data-timestamp="2930.37"> How many?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Counselor</h4><p begin="00:48:52.33" data-timestamp="2932.33"> 102, not including the three that's online so far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:48:57.08" data-timestamp="2937.08"> Which makes 105 students out of 226. Just three days before this on Friday, most of those students were in class virtually. Now over a hundred of them had disappeared. Mr. McGuire talked to one of his assistant principals about what happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Mcguire</h4><p begin="00:49:13.90" data-timestamp="2953.9"> I said, did we miss something this summer? She said, what do you mean? I said, did we miss something? Why are there so many kids missing? And she was like, I don't know. We got to find them. We just got to find out. And I was just like, yeah.</p><p begin="00:49:26.31" data-timestamp="2966.31">But I said, we communicated, right? We had it on the website. We put it on our social media. We sent ClassDojo. We used the parablast, right? We did mailers. We did those things, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:49:35.76" data-timestamp="2975.76"> Those things weren't enough. Mr. McGuire, the dean, the school counselor, the office manager, and a few teachers start calling parents, trying to figure out why their children didn't show up. I tried to figure it out too. I talked to several parents whose kids were not in school that first day, including Kierra Leonard. The reason she didn't take her kids in?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kierra Leonard</h4><p begin="00:49:56.06" data-timestamp="2996.06"> I just wanted to make sure that there were going to be no cases.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:49:59.66" data-timestamp="2999.66"> Kierra actually really wanted to send her two children back to school. Things were getting kind of wild at home. Her seven-year-old daughter was sneaking out of bed and staying up all night.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kierra Leonard</h4><p begin="00:50:09.02" data-timestamp="3009.02"> And she's up snacking and eating whatever she can find. She didn't go to sleep until the sun was coming up. She has a kitchen set in her room. I open the freezer, and there are the sprinkles to the cupcakes. What are you doing? Icing in the oven-- what are you doing?</p><p begin="00:50:30.41" data-timestamp="3030.41">I couldn't wait. That's why I was so for them going to school, because it was just like the schedule was broke. It was like they were just doing whatever they wanted to do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:50:43.13" data-timestamp="3043.13"> They needed to get back on a normal routine. At first, Kierra thought it seemed OK to send her kids to school. She went to a school orientation and thought the precautions seemed pretty sensible, like the desk shields and separate supplies for each student. But then--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kierra Leonard</h4><p begin="00:50:58.25" data-timestamp="3058.25"> After I went home from orientation, I went to get the kids from my mom. And that's when I explained to her what they had in place. And she just wasn't too sure about it, like, nuh-uh, not my grandbabies.</p><p begin="00:51:11.72" data-timestamp="3071.72">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:51:14.55" data-timestamp="3074.55">I mean, she sits up and watches the news all day, so you can just imagine what's going through her head. And she's like, nuh-uh. Because she has to pick them up from school. They're with her after school. So, I mean, I couldn't argue with her not wanted to be playing Russian roulette with COVID. So that's when I started questioning it. And I was like, well, let's just see how it goes the first day, see if we hear anything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:51:45.60" data-timestamp="3105.6"> So after the first two weeks of virtual learning, Kierra kept her kids at home instead of sending them into school for the first day back in person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kierra Leonard</h4><p begin="00:51:53.12" data-timestamp="3113.12"> I was torn. I knew they needed to be in class. It would help them more. But I wasn't sure if I wanted them to be with the first wave of kids that went back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:52:04.79" data-timestamp="3124.79"> She thought they could keep doing virtual learning, but then they couldn't get into the online classroom. When the school called to check where the kids were, she explained why she didn't send them in. They reassured her that things were going well so far, and they asked if there was anything they could do to help get the kids into school.</p><p begin="00:52:21.17" data-timestamp="3141.17">When she told them it was hard to pick them up on Fridays, they said that was fine. They could keep the kids an extra half hour until their grandma got off work. This, plus the fact that there were no COVID cases those first few days, won over both Kierra and her mother.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kierra Leonard</h4><p begin="00:52:34.88" data-timestamp="3154.88"> And I guess she just seen how much they were willing to work with us. And she knows as well that they need to be in school.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:52:44.30" data-timestamp="3164.3"> The school was doing tons of calls like these, including to another mother, Jamela Williams, who also kept her son Tre home that first day. She had a lot of worries that would have seemed small, but suddenly seemed big.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamela Williams</h4><p begin="00:52:56.82" data-timestamp="3176.82"> I spoke to more than one person. I spoke to three or four people, actually.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:53:01.49" data-timestamp="3181.49"> So what were the types of things you wanted to know from them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamela Williams</h4><p begin="00:53:05.92" data-timestamp="3185.92"> I wanted to know more about bathroom breaks, because I know they go in groups. And I know some kids don't wash their hands. I know my child sometimes doesn't wash his hands. So I was wondering, how would they take care of that sort of thing?</p><p begin="00:53:24.51" data-timestamp="3204.51">And they told me that there would be frequent restroom breaks. The restrooms are cleaned. And I think it's after every section of kids go they thoroughly clean it. So that made me feel very good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:53:38.19" data-timestamp="3218.19"> She also worried about her seven-year-old feeling comfortable and safe in a classroom with plastic shields on the desks and everyone in face masks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamela Williams</h4><p begin="00:53:45.48" data-timestamp="3225.48"> Well, I didn't want them to be scared. And they reassured me. And I've seen pictures, and it looked fine to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:53:53.67" data-timestamp="3233.67"> She was touched that so many people-- Tre's teacher, the school counselor, and Mr. McGuire-- were willing to talk through her concerns. Even the tone of their voices, that they were confident and jovial, signaled to her that they felt good about reopening. So maybe she didn't have as much to be worried about.</p><p begin="00:54:10.45" data-timestamp="3250.45">It's a stunning amount of extra work for the school, convincing parents one by one for their kids to attend the school they're already enrolled in, but this is what it took in so many cases. By the end of that first week, the school tracked down all but three of the missing students. They convinced around 70 more kids to come in person, and another 40 or so decided to stay online. Jamela's son Tre went back to school that Tuesday. Kierra, the mom who had to convince her mother, she sent her kids on Thursday.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:54:39.51" data-timestamp="3279.51"> I just feel like you are having to make this decision that so many parents across the country are having to deal with right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kierra Leonard</h4><p begin="00:54:47.77" data-timestamp="3287.77"> Yes. I was hoping that the other parents would make the decision for me so that I can ride their coattail, see how it was working for them and then see if it would work for us. So, I mean, if it has to be the other way around, so be it. Everything's fine-- no cases, no sick children, no problems-- but still just week two, week one for us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Wang</h4><p begin="00:55:25.38" data-timestamp="3325.38"> This difficult decision of how kids should return to school in so many places has played out like this. The federal government left it to the states, the states left it to the schools, and the schools left it to the parents. And how are the parents supposed to know what the right answer is to any of this? No wonder it played out the way it did at Tindley.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:54.32" data-timestamp="3354.32"> Stephanie Wang, she's the bureau chief of Chalk Beat Indiana.

<h3>Act Five: The Leftovers</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:08.61" data-timestamp="3368.61"> Act Five, The Leftovers. Of course, the big fear at every school right now is that they're going to start up classes in person in the fall and then the virus will arrive and spread through the student and teacher population, endangering everybody, and, of course, forcing them to shut down again, go back to mostly virtual learning. That happened at the University of North Carolina this month. Exactly one week after classes began, with 177 confirmed cases at the time, the school ended in-person undergraduate instruction and told students to start moving out of the residence halls and go home.</p><p begin="00:56:40.86" data-timestamp="3400.86">Kids have taken a while to clear out. And as they have, clusters of coronavirus cases keep popping up around campus in dorms, and fraternities, and a sorority house. NPR staffers Lauren Migaki and Elissa Nadworny were on UNC's campus last Saturday and happened to be at the school paper, <i>The</i> <i>Daily</i> <i>Tar</i> <i>Heel,</i> when one of the paper's editors, Brandon Standley, got a text about the latest cluster, the school's eighth at that point, before the school announced it. It was in the dorm called Craige.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="00:57:06.94" data-timestamp="3426.94"> Oh, man. Craige just reported that it's about to have a cluster. So we got notification from a housing employee. I think that's all the high-rises and most of the first-year residence halls.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interviewer</h4><p begin="00:57:19.72" data-timestamp="3439.72"> And Craige is where you live.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="00:57:20.79" data-timestamp="3440.79"> Craige is where I live. So that's really not exciting to know via a text message. This is not good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:30.58" data-timestamp="3450.58"> That was this past Saturday. One of our producers Robyn Semien called Brandon four days later to see what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:57:37.80" data-timestamp="3457.8"> After Brandon heard his dorm, Craige, had a cluster, his mom called, who wanted him to leave school. He said, no, Mom. Then he and some of his friends started texting on a group chat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="00:57:49.29" data-timestamp="3469.29"> One of my coworkers said "what" in all caps. One of them said [BLEEP] me. One of them said, what if we've come into contact with those people? And they're going home and would potentially spread it to their communities.</p><p begin="00:58:01.45" data-timestamp="3481.45">One of them called us cluster Craige. One of them was scared about getting tested. So she said, if you see me having a panic attack getting tested, no, you didn't. I talked about how I was scared to get the COVID test too. I said, if you see me crying because that COVID test poked my brain, no, you didn't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:58:20.34" data-timestamp="3500.34"> Ultimately, in the evening, he went back to his dorm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="00:58:23.83" data-timestamp="3503.83"> And the parking lot outside the building was just completely full. And there was families moving out. There were students moving all their stuff. It was a lot of people in one tiny, little area.</p><p begin="00:58:35.52" data-timestamp="3515.52">And they were walking up and down the breezeway with fridges, and boxes, and things like that. And I had to walk straight into that, because it's really the clearest entrance to get to the building. So I had to walk straight through that and straight into the main area where people were taking the elevators up and down.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:58:51.73" data-timestamp="3531.73"> It sounds pretty crowded.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="00:58:53.38" data-timestamp="3533.38"> I would say it was. I felt nervous.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:58:56.37" data-timestamp="3536.37"> He beelined to his room on the third floor, talked to nobody.

UNC has said basically, we know we invited you back, but please leave.</p><p begin="00:59:11.58" data-timestamp="3551.58">Brandon is technically allowed to stay. He's paid to manage the dorm RAs, resident assistants, who clearly have fewer and fewer residents to assist. Brandon has a bathroom to himself now. It's kind of nice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="00:59:25.53" data-timestamp="3565.53"> Yeah, I'm hoping to stay, and I'm hoping to keep my job because this is my livelihood right now. This is how I make ends meet. This is how I put gas in my car and how I feed myself. And I'm really hoping that that doesn't disappear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="00:59:37.38" data-timestamp="3577.38"> As of now, Brandon and the 15 remaining RAs can stay, but he sees the problem. If the resident count gets too low, the university will terminate them and kick them out.</p><p begin="00:59:55.64" data-timestamp="3595.64">So Craige, a big, fairly empty dorm meant for about 650 people, a six-story building shaped like an X with an A, B, C, and D wing, lounges, and an elevator tower in the center, Brandon estimated on Wednesday there may be 90 residents left. I talked to Brandon in his dorm room. At a certain point, I ask him to please just walk into the hall for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:00:18.05" data-timestamp="3618.05"> Give me one second.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:00:19.37" data-timestamp="3619.37"> OK. I'm so curious if there's people out there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:00:24.18" data-timestamp="3624.18"> Yeah. Let me put on some shoes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:00:25.85" data-timestamp="3625.85"> And a mask.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:00:26.33" data-timestamp="3626.33"> And a mask. All right. Here we go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:00:32.49" data-timestamp="3632.49"> He leaves his room on the third floor.</p><p begin="01:00:34.83" data-timestamp="3634.83">[DOOR SHUTTING]</p><p begin="01:00:35.73" data-timestamp="3635.73">All the hallways are outdoors, breezeways.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:00:38.45" data-timestamp="3638.45"> But looking out, I can see up to the sixth floor and down to the ground. There's literally nobody in the breezeway, not a single person on the volleyball court. I thought I just heard a door open, but maybe I'm crazy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:00:52.01" data-timestamp="3652.01"> What about the lounge? Are you close to the lounge?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:00:54.52" data-timestamp="3654.52"> Yeah. Let me go to the lounge.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:00:55.48" data-timestamp="3655.48"> OK, let's go see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:00:57.74" data-timestamp="3657.74"> Nobody. It sounds so quiet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:01:00.70" data-timestamp="3660.7"> It is quiet there. The light is on. There is not a single person here. I'm walking into the basketball side now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:01:08.79" data-timestamp="3668.79"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:01:09.35" data-timestamp="3669.35"> Oh, there's a person.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:01:11.18" data-timestamp="3671.18"> Oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:01:11.68" data-timestamp="3671.68"> There's actually a person.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:01:13.36" data-timestamp="3673.36"> A student who was late and can't talk, one student.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:01:17.75" data-timestamp="3677.75"> I'm looking out now at the basketball side, doing the same thing that I was doing on the volleyball side. And I can see up to the sixth floor and down to the ground. And there's not a single person. Doesn't even look like the light is on in any of the rooms. And there's kind of just nobody.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:01:36.02" data-timestamp="3696.02"> He goes to the kitchen-- nobody. Does the entire fourth floor, too. Nobody.</p><p begin="01:01:48.41" data-timestamp="3708.41">In August, just before the school went online, <i>The</i> <i>Daily</i> <i>Tar</i> <i>Heel</i> ran a piece with the frustrated headline, "We All Saw This Coming." But not Brandon. He wasn't as skeptical of UNC's reopening plan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:02:01.09" data-timestamp="3721.09"> And I thought that if there was an outbreak on campus that the university would lock down the buildings, lock down the campus, force everyone to quarantine. It's kind of like a snowstorm. I just thought it was going to be just like that. It was going to be like two weeks worth of a snow day for everybody. And we were all going to be sick, and it was going to suck, but it was going to be OK enough, you know what I mean?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:02:24.86" data-timestamp="3744.86"> You really had confidence in their plan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:02:27.51" data-timestamp="3747.51"> I did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:02:28.77" data-timestamp="3748.77"> Two weeks of quarantine, that was Brandon's backup plan for the university. The university had no such backup plan for Brandon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Standley</h4><p begin="01:02:37.01" data-timestamp="3757.01"> They don't. I was stunned. I was shocked. I was like, are you serious? What was the point of touting the safety plans that you had in place if you had any sort of inkling that if there's an outbreak that you're going to send people home? I would love to be in the room where that happened and sit down and listen to them say, well, if there's 300 cases, we're just going to send everybody home. Because that's what they ended up doing, is there was a little over 300 cases reported within a week and a half, two weeks, and they sent everyone home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Robyn Semien</h4><p begin="01:03:12.13" data-timestamp="3792.13"> UNC did a survey over the summer, asking students if they'd go to parties this year. Over a quarter said yes. Maybe that's the only thing the university needed to know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="01:03:29.28" data-timestamp="3809.28"> Robyn Semien is one of the producers of our show.</p><p begin="01:04:03.21" data-timestamp="3843.21">Our program was produced today by Emanuele Berry and Diane Wu.
