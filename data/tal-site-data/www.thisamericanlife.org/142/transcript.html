<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.67" data-timestamp="0.67">People really were different back in the '60s. Here is something that it is impossible to imagine any politician saying today-- any successful, mainstream, big-time politician anyway. Listen to the President of the United States, June 4, 1965.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>President Lyndon Baines Johnson</h4><p begin="00:00:14.70" data-timestamp="14.7">Perhaps most important is the breakdown of the Negro family structure. For this, most of all white America must accept responsibility. It flows from centuries years of oppression and persecution of the Negro man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.11" data-timestamp="39.11">In 1965, black single mothers became a national political issue, a national symbol, for the very first time. And it was the Democrats who put the issue on the table. A young Assistant Secretary of Labor named Daniel Patrick Moynihan submitted a report to President Lyndon Johnson calling for national action, to do something about the large number of black single mothers.</p><p begin="00:01:00.19" data-timestamp="60.19">When large numbers of men grow up in homes without strong male authority, the report said, it leads to chaos, crime, violence, and unrest. Black single mothers, the report declared, were at the center of quote "a tangle of pathology in the black community." Black leaders, including the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior, did not take too kindly to all this. They said that all this talk of black pathology had unfortunate racist overtones, and the issue dropped from the national scene for years.</p><p begin="00:01:30.79" data-timestamp="90.79">Then the Republicans picked it up. Ronald Reagan talked about welfare queens. Dan Quayle said the LA riots happened mainly because of a breakdown in traditional family structure. For two decades, the entire national debate over welfare reform has often seemed like it's really just a referendum on inner city single mothers, which brings us to Barbara Clinkscales.</p><p begin="00:01:51.88" data-timestamp="111.88">We gave Barbara Clinkscales a cassette recorder. And for seven months, she taped her family's life. And the story we bring you today, her life in her own words, it isn't that it completely contradicts everything in the national debate over single mothers, though sometimes it does contradict that debate. It's more that when you hear her talk, the national policy discussion somehow seems irrelevant and off the point. It's as if the policymakers have no real picture of what a life like hers is really like.</p><p begin="00:02:23.98" data-timestamp="143.98">Today, we devote our entire program to her story. From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p></div> </div>
</div>
<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:39.05" data-timestamp="159.05">Like most African-American single mothers, like 77% of them, Barbara Clinkscales works for a living. She has a job in the new information economy as a data entry operator. And she's so committed to seeing that her kids graduate high school that when her son, Gerald, cut some classes, she started escorting him to class herself, telling his classmates, "My name is Barbara. I think we'll be seeing a lot of each other from now on."</p><p begin="00:03:03.63" data-timestamp="183.63">Before we start her story, some quick statistics to put all this in perspective. Barbara's family is not unusual at all. There has been a radical shift in American family structure. The number of children born to black single mothers has risen from 17% in 1950 to 70%, seven zero, in 1994. The number of white children born to single mothers has risen even faster, from 1.7% in 1950 to 25% in 1994. Here, then, is the story of one single mother told in her own words.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:03:38.94" data-timestamp="218.94">OK. Hi, I know we late. I'm sorry. Yeah, it's my fault this time.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:03:45.87" data-timestamp="225.87">Let me introduce myself. My name is Barbara.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman At High School</h4><p begin="00:03:48.39" data-timestamp="228.39">Good morning, Miss Clinkscales.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:03:49.74" data-timestamp="229.74">Hi baby, good morning.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:03:51.10" data-timestamp="231.1">I'm a single mom. I have three kids, Angie, Tess, and Gerald.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man At High School</h4><p begin="00:03:55.23" data-timestamp="235.23">Good morning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:03:55.44" data-timestamp="235.44">Good morning.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:03:56.77" data-timestamp="236.77">Angie's 25. Tess and Gerald are 17. They are twins. They're in high school, in the 11th grade.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:04:02.87" data-timestamp="242.87">Hi, my name is Barbara Clinkscales. Everybody knows me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Maybaum</h4><p begin="00:04:04.99" data-timestamp="244.99">Yeah, I know that name from somewhere, Clinkscales.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:04:06.79" data-timestamp="246.79">Yeah, I always bring him to school. And I stand here while he goes up to his locker, and he comes back.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:04:12.52" data-timestamp="252.52">Every morning, I take Gerald to school. If I don't take him to school, he'd get up, get dressed, and he'd just sit there. He won't go. In order to take him to school, I have to go a half hour out of my way in the opposite direction of my workplace. Then after I leave his school, it takes me another 50 minutes to an hour back past my house before I get to work. Altogether, it takes me an hour and a half to two hours to get to work in the morning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:04:42.01" data-timestamp="282.01">But I'm sorry, Mr. Maybaum.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Maybaum</h4><p begin="00:04:43.27" data-timestamp="283.27">That's OK, everyone's right out here. Last week, almost every afternoon-- I'm going to go get my book-- he did not come to my afternoon classes. Let me go get my book.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:04:52.27" data-timestamp="292.27">OK. Where were you? Where were you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gerald Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:04:59.73" data-timestamp="299.73">I was at school.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:00.74" data-timestamp="300.74">You stayed in school, but you just didn't go to his class?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Maybaum</h4><p begin="00:05:03.81" data-timestamp="303.81">That doesn't sound like it makes any sense, does it, Gerald? Where did you go if you stayed in school?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:10.17" data-timestamp="310.17">The twins don't go to school in the neighborhood we live in. I had to borrow my coworker's address to get them into Bogan High School because I feel Bogan High School is a real good school. They really care about the kids, and they work with you. Like Gerald's teacher, Mr. Maybaum. He cares about Gerald as if Gerald was his own child.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Maybaum</h4><p begin="00:05:29.07" data-timestamp="329.07">Where have you been going? Come on. You might as well tell us. No big, dark secret, is it? Where you been going?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:34.54" data-timestamp="334.54">Where did you go last week? Gerald, are those hickies on your neck?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Gerald Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:40.71" data-timestamp="340.71">No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:41.20" data-timestamp="341.2">Yes, they are. What a-- Turn around. You see that, Mr. Maybaum?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Maybaum</h4><p begin="00:05:45.88" data-timestamp="345.88">What's that?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:46.48" data-timestamp="346.48">That's what he's probably doing. Those are the love passion marks, hickies.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Maybaum</h4><p begin="00:05:50.82" data-timestamp="350.82">Could be. Could be.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:05:52.27" data-timestamp="352.27">If I hit you upside your head, you'll know what they are.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:06:01.64" data-timestamp="361.64">Right now, all I can focus on is the twins and getting them through high school. Get them through high school.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:06:10.80" data-timestamp="370.8">Now we're walking him down to the other end of the school to the counselor's office, Mr. Ware, where he'll have to reinstate Gerald because of those two cuts.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:06:24.47" data-timestamp="384.47">When I talk to them about graduating, I always tell them, when they walk across that stage, I'm going to do a cartwheel. And my best girlfriend, she says, she's going to do a split. And the twins look at us and laugh. And they say, they want to see this. And I say, well, I better start practicing because I know you guys are going to walk across that stage.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:06:47.18" data-timestamp="407.18">OK, what I was doing, that moment of silence, I was writing my name and the time, signing in, on the sign-in sheet in Room 102. I'm sitting here next to Gerald waiting.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:07:01.25" data-timestamp="421.25">I always dreamed about going on a prom, all the senior activities that the seniors do when they graduate from high school. I didn't get a chance to go on a prom because when I was graduating from high school, I had my own apartment. I had been out on my own ever since I was 16 years old. So I had to play grown-up. But I can live some of my dreams through them. That's why I feel the way that I feel, that nothing is going to get in my way, nothing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Barbara Clinkscales</h4><p begin="00:07:48.10" data-timestamp="468.1">You really think you're smart, Gerald, don't you?

Grantey is from Jamaica And he's been telling me about his nephew, Marvin, and Jamaica for a long, long time. He always told me that Marvin would be the perfect, perfect man for me. But I never paid him any attention. And one Sunday morning, Grantey called me around 7 o'clock in the morning, saying, he just got back from Jamaica, and he had pictures and a phone number, and his nephew wanted me to call him. And I laid in bed, and I tried to go back to sleep, but I couldn't.

My girls came and picked me up from the airport. And I haven't woke up from this dream yet. So maybe it's not a dream.</p><p begin="00:31:25.39" data-timestamp="1885.39">It's late. Let me look at the time. It's like 2:00 AM. So I've been laying here for about an hour and a half, thinking about the last 11 days of my life in Jamaica with Marvin. Marvin Malcolm Craig.</p><p begin="00:31:51.99" data-timestamp="1911.99">Marvin. He's 29 years old. Yes, and I'm 41. When I saw the movie <i>How</i> <i>Stella</i> <i>Got</i> <i>Her</i> <i>Groove</i> <i>Back,</i> I made my daughter Angie promise she wouldn't date over a certain age, and I wouldn't date under a certain age because we would never bump heads dating. And who breaks the promise? Me.</p><p begin="00:32:35.74" data-timestamp="1955.74">I can't believe it. My daughter will be 26 in November. And March-- let's see, November, December, January, February, March. So he's a year and four months older than my daughter. No, two years, four months. Oh boy. Well, I don't care.</p><p begin="00:33:08.39" data-timestamp="1988.39">On my way there, I was so nervous. I was so nervous. I was so scared. But soon I walked out of the airport, I went over there to him, and he just grabbed and hugged me. And that was the beginning of my new life. Oh my God, Barbara, what have you done?</p><p begin="00:33:41.53" data-timestamp="2021.53">He proposed to me, and I said, yes. He had one of his rings melted down, and made into an engagement ring, and asked me to marry him. And he inscribed "Love MC" and the date that he proposed. Oh God.</p><p begin="00:34:06.14" data-timestamp="2046.14">I am so lucky. God, thank you. I know. I used to write letters to God. And I would put them in a Bible, praying for a man because I was tired of the dating.</p><p begin="00:34:18.79" data-timestamp="2058.79">And every time I write a letter, God will give me what I wanted. And I said, oh Lord, I should have been more specific. I left out something. I got to think about this.</p><p begin="00:34:27.27" data-timestamp="2067.27">I got to think about this letter. OK, I don't want him to do drugs. OK, drink to be sociable. And my coworker, Doris Kelly, she said, "God will give you what you want. So if you want him to look a certain way, write it down there." I'm like, "Oh, I can do that?" She's like, "Yeah, it's OK."</p><p begin="00:34:46.19" data-timestamp="2086.19">OK, I wrote down there what I want him to look like. And I always would leave something out. And you know what I left out this time? I forget to put down, "God, please let him be in the same country. And God, can you let him be kind of close to my age?"</p><p begin="00:35:03.30" data-timestamp="2103.3">So ladies, when you write a letter to God, you can't leave anything out. And I always leave something out. But that's OK, Father. I'm up for this challenge.</p><p begin="00:35:22.63" data-timestamp="2122.63">There's so much. There's so much. Oh God. And the hardest thing was Marvin and I was laying in the bed. And I usually take my shower first. But Marvin took his shower first.</p><p begin="00:35:42.25" data-timestamp="2142.25">And he said, "Come, Barbara. Come get in the shower." I did not want to do that. Because I would not let him see me without my clothes on because I feel my body was so ugly, stretch marks from having kids, being a full-figured woman. I know, look at your beautiful body, breasts sit up all perfect. And I sat there, holding my stomach, holding my breath.</p><p begin="00:36:13.94" data-timestamp="2173.94">And he called me, "Are you coming, Barbara? What's wrong, honey? Honey, what's wrong?" I took a deep breath, and I undressed and got in the shower.</p><p begin="00:36:25.53" data-timestamp="2185.53">And he just took the towel, and he just soaped it up, and washed me. And I stared at him. I kept trying to see his face, see his eyes. And all my fears and insecurities went away. He took those fears away.</p><p begin="00:36:59.20" data-timestamp="2219.2">And I just keep asking myself, why me? And everyone like, Barbara, why not? Why not?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:21.70" data-timestamp="2241.7">Coming up, things take a turn for the worst in a minute from Public Radio International when our program continues.</p></div> </div>

I'm sitting in my bedroom on the end of my bed. I stayed at work 'til about 7:00, 7:30. I didn't want to come home. I just didn't want to deal with this problem, deal with this-- I was praying I didn't have to go through this.</p><p begin="00:39:11.66" data-timestamp="2351.66">So I'm just sitting here. Thought I'd just pick the mic up and talk about it. I'd call Gerald in, and we can talk about it. Tess called me, and she had Keisha on the phone, Gerald's girlfriend. And did Tess tell me she was pregnant, or did Keisha tell me she is pregnant? I think it was Tess said that Keisha was pregnant.</p><p begin="00:39:38.60" data-timestamp="2378.6">I can't remember. I went into shock. I didn't say anything for about 10 minutes 'til Tess got scared. And she kept saying, "Momma, momma, momma are you there? Momma, momma?" I went into shock. I went into total shock.</p><p begin="00:39:57.16" data-timestamp="2397.16">I felt sick and dizzy. And then I just started praying. And that's when I heard Tess say, "Momma."</p><p begin="00:40:15.24" data-timestamp="2415.24">How do this feel? I'm trying to sum it up in words. How do this feel? I want to cry. I want to scream. Oh God.</p><p begin="00:40:29.66" data-timestamp="2429.66">Last night, I went and picked Angie up from work. And on my way out the door, Gerald stopped me. And he was on the phone. And he said, "Momma, I have a friend, and he's named after his dad. If he have a son, would his son be the second or the third?"</p><p begin="00:40:49.49" data-timestamp="2449.49">So I used Gerald as an example. I said, "Well, Gerald, you're a junior. Your dad is senior. He's Gerald Louis Clinkscales, number one. You're number two. And if you had a child, your son would be Gerald Louis Clinkscales the third."</p><p begin="00:41:07.02" data-timestamp="2467.02">And I just walked my happy-go-lucky butt on down the steps, went out the door, got in the car. And I started up the car, and something said, I hope that fool haven't got some girl pregnant, and he was talking about himself. Then I look at the time, I'm like, oh Lord, it's 9:50, I better get out of here. And it left me. I haven't thought anything else about it until the phone call.</p><p begin="00:41:49.81" data-timestamp="2509.81">Oh my heart hurts so bad. My stomach hurts so bad. Oh Father, in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, I don't want to go through this.

What am I going to say? What am I going to say? Oh God, forgive me for this, but I don't want to deal with it. I want to act like it's not happening. Because I am so tired. I'm so tired of dealing with things.</p><p begin="00:42:50.42" data-timestamp="2570.42">OK, Barbara, take a deep breath. Blow it out. Call Gerald, and just say what the first thing on your mind.

And hear you, I'll be two weeks later, calling back. So that's it. It's messed up for me right now.</p><p begin="00:50:58.80" data-timestamp="3058.8">People are acting like they don't want to help nobody and stuff, acting all shisty. It's hot in here. It's 90, almost 100 degrees. Hot, sweaty, talking on microphones, stomach hurt, feel like I'm about to throw up. Talking to you about my personal life. I'm really messed up. But I messed up.
