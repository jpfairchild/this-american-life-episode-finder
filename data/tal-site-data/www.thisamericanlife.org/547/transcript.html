<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.56" data-timestamp="0.56">Hey there, everybody. If you're listening on our podcast or the internet, there are words in this episode that we have un-beeped. If you prefer a beeped version of the show, you could find that at our website, thisamericanlife.org. There are 9-1-1 calls where people are basically calling the cops on the cops. Lisa Mahon did that in September. She was on her way to the county hospital in Chicago. Her mom was dying and the hospital called, saying that she'd stopped breathing and had just been put on a ventilator. So Lisa had her two kids in the back and her friend Jamal was up front, and she was just about to pull into the expressway near Hammond, Indiana, near where she lives, when a police officer pulled her over for not wearing a seat belt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:00:37.87" data-timestamp="37.87">Now, the strange part about all of this is when he asked me for my license and insurance, usually, the police officer gets back in the car and runs the license plates, runs the license. He didn't do any of that. He put the information in his pocket and never took it out. What officer puts it in a pocket and not go to the police car?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:58.17" data-timestamp="58.17">And what's his manner like when he asked you for the license?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:01:00.71" data-timestamp="60.71">Oh my god. Well, first of all, he's moving from side to side. His body is not still. His eyes wasn't blinking. He was really acting kind of hyper. He wasn't acting professional. He wasn't acting like a police officer at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:15.10" data-timestamp="75.1">Lisa had been in law enforcement herself. She'd been a corrections officer. Her dad taught criminal justice. She's got no problem with cops at all. But this one was acting so weird, she says, she kept her window up.</p><p begin="00:01:25.04" data-timestamp="85.04">The officer, Lieutenant Patrick Fucari, didn't return our calls. According to Lisa and to a statement issued by the Hammond police, Lieutenant Fucari next asked for Jamal's ID. Jamal was sitting in the passenger seat and, Lisa says, wearing a seat belt, so it's not clear why this was necessary. Jamal didn't have his ID. According to the police statement, Jamal moved his hand below where the officer could see and the officer started fearing for his own safety. A second officer arrived. The interaction got weird enough that Lisa turned to her 14-year-old in the backseat and asked him to do what people do these days in this situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:01:57.79" data-timestamp="117.79">Jojo, get your phone out and videotape this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jojo</h4><p begin="00:02:00.38" data-timestamp="120.38">I'm already doing it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:01.60" data-timestamp="121.6">The officers asked Jamal to get out of the car. Jamal didn't want to get out, and through the window, he asked for what he called a white shirt, a supervisor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamal</h4><p begin="00:02:09.10" data-timestamp="129.1">Y'all got a white shirt?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Officer</h4><p begin="00:02:11.22" data-timestamp="131.22">Look at my shoulder, dumb ass. I got the bars.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:13.85" data-timestamp="133.85">"I got the bars." He is a supervisor. From the police perspective, Jamal is not complying. Jamal starts looking for a ticket that he'd gotten that could prove who he is. He reaches into his book bag.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:02:25.49" data-timestamp="145.49">As soon as he went inside the bag, that's when the two officers pulled the gun out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jamal</h4><p begin="00:02:29.75" data-timestamp="149.75">I got my kids in the car. You're drawing your weapon.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:32.40" data-timestamp="152.4">It continues like this. Lisa starts to feel like these cops are not acting the way cops should. Let's get some adults here. There must be somebody above these people, and she calls 9-1-1.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:02:41.35" data-timestamp="161.35">Hammond 9-1-1.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:02:43.03" data-timestamp="163.03">The police just pulled a gun on me. I'm sitting in my car. And then they're asking me to open the door. I am scared.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:49.98" data-timestamp="169.98">"The officer pulled a gun on me, I'm sitting in my car, they asked me to open the door, I'm scared," she says.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:02:55.31" data-timestamp="175.31">Calm down. Pulling out a gun-- are you opening-- are you getting-- are you following the officer's orders?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:01.61" data-timestamp="181.61">Now they're asking me to open the door. I'm scared to open the door.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:04.66" data-timestamp="184.66">Why are you scared to open the door?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:06.06" data-timestamp="186.06">Because he pulled a gun out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:07.78" data-timestamp="187.78">OK. If he's pulling a gun out, maybe because he is in fear of his life as well.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:11.59" data-timestamp="191.59">No. We don't have anything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:14.44" data-timestamp="194.44">Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:16.46" data-timestamp="196.46">Yes, yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:17.86" data-timestamp="197.86">He cannot see in your vehicle. You--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:19.58" data-timestamp="199.58">She said the officer can't see in the vehicle. I said, what do you mean he can't see in the window? I said it's broad daylight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:26.73" data-timestamp="206.73">All you need to do is follow the officer's orders.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:32.05" data-timestamp="212.05">I'm scared to open the door.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:34.10" data-timestamp="214.1">Do you think the dispatcher understood why you were afraid?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:38.06" data-timestamp="218.06">She didn't care. She didn't care. She never was helpful.</p><p begin="00:03:45.11" data-timestamp="225.11">Now I'm scared for my life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:46.76" data-timestamp="226.76">Why are you scared for your life? It's a police officer pulling you over for--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:48.83" data-timestamp="228.83">Because he pulled a gun on us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:03:50.30" data-timestamp="230.3">Are you going to-- are you going to stop screaming and listen?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:53.56" data-timestamp="233.56">Were you surprised at the tone she took with you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:03:56.34" data-timestamp="236.34">Oh, yes. It was unbelievable. I don't have no help. No one's going to help.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:04:02.00" data-timestamp="242">OK. Number one, if you're getting pulled over by an officer for not wearing your seat belt, if you cooperate, there would be no problem. You would already be at the hospital.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:11.50" data-timestamp="251.5">The Hammond police statement on this incident runs two pages but does not mention Officer Fucari drawing his gun. It does say that the officer was afraid that the passengers had a gun, though it doesn't say why this mom and her friend and two kids would make him think that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:25.26" data-timestamp="265.26">Can I ask you, do you think if it had been me who had been pulled over, do you think he would have treated me that way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:04:31.07" data-timestamp="271.07">Oh, absolutely not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:33.55" data-timestamp="273.55">Because I'm white?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Mahon</h4><p begin="00:04:34.91" data-timestamp="274.91">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:04:36.63" data-timestamp="276.63">Then you need to just get out of the car.

<h3>Act One: Act One</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:07:43.82" data-timestamp="463.82">When Chief Ed Flynn took over the Milwaukee police department in 2008, he was coming into one of the most segregated cities in America, a city that sends enormous numbers of black men to prison. Wisconsin sends the highest percentage of black men to prison of any state in the country, and in Milwaukee, that means more than half of black men in their 30s and early 40s have been to prison. And just to give you a sense of how bad relations got between black residents and police, in 2004, the city saw a brutal incident that some people call Milwaukee's Rodney King case, the beating of Frank Jude.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:08:16.53" data-timestamp="496.53">They're beating him up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:08:17.81" data-timestamp="497.81">OK. [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:08:19.20" data-timestamp="499.2">Jude was an exotic dancer. He did bachelorette parties. And one night after work, he ended up at a party full of off duty police officers. A group of about a dozen officers, all of whom were white and many of whom were drunk, surrounded Jude, who was black, and started beating him. They claimed he'd stolen one of their badges. Just like in the incident you heard about at the beginning of the show, one of the women who'd brought Frank Jude to the party decided to call 9-1-1 on the cops as they handcuffed Jude, cut his clothes off, and essentially tortured him-- kicked him repeatedly, bent his fingers back, shoved a pen in his ears, causing them to bleed. Even when the dispatcher sent on duty officers to the scene, one of them joined in the beating, stomping on Frank Jude's head while the other officers stood by.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:09:05.98" data-timestamp="545.98">They're kicking him, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:09:06.60" data-timestamp="546.6">You're saying that the two officers that just arrived in the squad got out and started beating your friend also?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:09:12.79" data-timestamp="552.79">Yeah. They're holding him down. They're beating-- [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:09:29.58" data-timestamp="569.58">Eventually, seven officers were fired, three were sentenced to over 15 years in prison, but before that, officers closed ranks. No one talked. No one knew anything. It showed the city how cops would turn the other way and protect their own even if they saw something truly terrible. The case hung over Milwaukee for years.</p><p begin="00:09:47.65" data-timestamp="587.65">So this was the climate Ed Flynn was walking into when he became chief. Flynn had been in law enforcement for 35 years. He'd led several small city departments-- Chelsea and Springfield in Massachusetts, and Arlington, Virginia. He'd served as Secretary of Public Safety for the whole state of Massachusetts. But when the job opened up in Milwaukee, it had a special appeal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:10:07.57" data-timestamp="607.57">One of the attractive things for Milwaukee for me was that it had a very significant crime problem, highly concentrated in communities that had an historical antipathy for their police department.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:19.63" data-timestamp="619.63">That's what was attractive to you, crime and antipathy for the police?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:10:23.50" data-timestamp="623.5">I mean, absolutely. I mean, to me, Milwaukee represented the crux of the challenge of American policing in the 21st century.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:30.42" data-timestamp="630.42">And as Chief Flynn sees it, that challenge is--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:10:33.48" data-timestamp="633.48">Those neighborhoods that need us the most and demand our services, when they get us, get mad at us. How do we bridge that?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:10:41.97" data-timestamp="641.97">Flynn says he's confronted this his whole career, all the way back to when he started out as a beat cop in the '70s in Jersey City.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:10:47.91" data-timestamp="647.91">I would go to street corners and there'd be, like, six black kids on a corner in an all black neighborhood. I would always end up with a call for service saying complaints about kids hanging on a corner. Go back to that corner. OK, kids you've got to move. You're just harassing us because we're black. OK, do you see anybody else in this neighborhood? Why do you think I'm picking on you? I said, somebody called. Well, who are they? We want to know. We have a right to stand here. Point is folks that were calling us up looked just like the people that were hanging on the corner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:11:17.95" data-timestamp="677.95">Flynn still sees this today in Milwaukee. Most of the city's crime victims are African American and they're the group that has the most animosity towards the police. That's not just in Milwaukee, obviously, but all around the country. So here's a problem people have been debating heatedly, especially since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, and here's a guy who's been trying to fix the problem, to mend the relationship between black residents and the police in his city for the last seven years. He's idealistic. He's smart. He can sound very professorial, especially when he talks about the history of poverty and crime and policing. He goes in front of residents and says things like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:11:54.56" data-timestamp="714.56">We in this police department and in the police profession know we have inherited a social history of which we can't always be proud. The police have often been in the middle of great conflict and not infrequently been agents of social control to preserve a status quo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:12:13.34" data-timestamp="733.34">By the way, he's not reading here. This is just how he talks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:12:15.92" data-timestamp="735.92">And certainly in Milwaukee in the last 40 years, you've have your own rich history, sometimes between the police and the community. So we've been working real hard in improving our relationship with neighborhoods so we had achieved some level of legitimacy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:12:30.94" data-timestamp="750.94">Flynn became police chief in 2008. So what's he done? How's it going? He didn't enact one single big reform. It was lots of smaller, sometimes boring stuff. He created a code of conduct, redrew the borders of police districts, shifted hundreds of officers from the citywide detective unit onto the streets, a move that wasn't popular in the department. He did a big push to work with dozens of community groups. He started this program with researchers at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee to go into schools and teach kids in high crime areas why police are stopping people more often in their neighborhoods, how they should behave during stops, and how officers should behave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Instructor</h4><p begin="00:13:09.73" data-timestamp="789.73">So how would you, as a kid, feel walking in this area, knowing what you know now, and the police stop you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:13:16.57" data-timestamp="796.57">I would be upset.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Instructor</h4><p begin="00:13:18.39" data-timestamp="798.39">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Student</h4><p begin="00:13:20.09" data-timestamp="800.09">But you should be appreciative and happy that they're doing something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:13:24.89" data-timestamp="804.89">As I spent time with members of the department, it was hard to pinpoint exactly what effect these changes have had, but I did get the sense that something had changed, even if it was sometimes intangible. For instance, I kept hearing certain words again and again. The most popular noun I heard, "community." The most popular verb?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 1</h4><p begin="00:13:42.09" data-timestamp="822.09">We're here to engage and have a conversation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 2</h4><p begin="00:13:44.43" data-timestamp="824.43">The officers should be marketing all the opportunities to engage with us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 3</h4><p begin="00:13:48.21" data-timestamp="828.21">It has helped us to become more engaged in the community.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 4</h4><p begin="00:13:51.52" data-timestamp="831.52">Our community engagement and the activities that we've been doing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 5</h4><p begin="00:13:54.49" data-timestamp="834.49">Building police legitimacy takes place when you directly engage.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:13:59.01" data-timestamp="839.01">Of course, police departments all over the country use these exact buzzwords-- say they're engaging more and doing community policing-- but it's hard to know what this actually means.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:14:07.68" data-timestamp="847.68">I'm sorry I threw "engagement" out there. I'm trying to get engaged.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:14:13.46" data-timestamp="853.46">No, it's all good.

She's been on the force seven years. She's worked juvenile crimes, auto thefts. She worked undercover. Now she's a supervisor and she says it's an entirely new police department.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dispatcher</h4><p begin="00:14:29.92" data-timestamp="869.92">10-4, thank you. Go ahead and respond to 3291 to the shots fired.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:14:34.51" data-timestamp="874.51">3217. I can respond to that as well.

At around six o'clock, she heads to a block where shots have been reported.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:14:48.06" data-timestamp="888.06">So now we're in the area. We're going to try and see what we can stir up.</p><p begin="00:14:54.56" data-timestamp="894.56">Do you see anything going on out here, bud?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:14:57.45" data-timestamp="897.45">Nothing out here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:14:59.71" data-timestamp="899.71">Janick talks through her window to a guy on the sidewalk. He says he's been out there like five minutes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:15:03.81" data-timestamp="903.81">You didn't hear anything?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:15:05.36" data-timestamp="905.36">Not five minutes ago.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:15:06.44" data-timestamp="906.44">About five minutes ago you heard something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:15:07.74" data-timestamp="907.74">No, no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:15:08.85" data-timestamp="908.85">It's worth noting that the gunshot Janick is responding to, she didn't learn about it from a 9-1-1 call. She learned about it from something called Shot Spotter. It's new technology that Chief Flynn and several other chiefs around the country have put in place that uses sensors around the city to detect when gunshots go off and tells the cops what block they happened on. What that means, though, is that even though Janick talks to several people who say, yeah, I heard a shot, not one of them called 9-1-1. No one in the neighborhood did. Sergeant Janick says this is common. When they installed Shot Spotter, the department found out that only 17% of all the shots fired were resulting in residents calling the police.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:15:47.08" data-timestamp="947.08">You heard it?

"Police members can be expected to make numerous contacts with the public on a daily basis. These contacts form the basis for the relationship between the department and the community." I rode on three shifts and watched a bunch of different officers, and one thing that struck me was how a single 9-1-1 call or just a single shot fired on Shot Spotter could quickly lead an officer to talking to a dozen people or more as they try to figure out what happened.</p><p begin="00:16:26.00" data-timestamp="986">With this shot fired, for instance, when I was out with Sergeant Janick, there was no conclusion. They didn't find a shooter or a bullet or a casing, but still, it was an excuse for Sergeant Janick to interact with at least seven people, and it was easy for those conversations to move beyond the gunshot she was there to look into, like with this woman who was coming out of her garage.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:16:45.35" data-timestamp="1005.35">Ma'am, did you hear anything out here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:16:47.27" data-timestamp="1007.27">You said did I hear anything?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:16:48.74" data-timestamp="1008.74">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:16:48.93" data-timestamp="1008.93">No, I didn't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Theresa Janick</h4><p begin="00:16:50.52" data-timestamp="1010.52">Nothing?

They updated the captain about a meeting they'd held with people who lived near the site of a recent homicide who had helped them identify 17 nuisance properties where criminal activity might be going on. They read aloud from emails a guy sent them with the license plate of cars he saw picking up suspected prostitutes, and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 6</h4><p begin="00:19:33.11" data-timestamp="1173.11">One more update.

They're going to get a landlord to replace some busted glass. Three years into Flynn's tenure, it was going pretty well. Violent crimes were down, homicides were down, citizen complaints against police were decreasing by quite a bit. Then in the summer of 2011, things took a bad turn, starting with the arrest of a man named Derek Williams. One night in July, officers responded to the scene of a robbery and found Williams. He was 22 years old, black. He ran. Officers chased him over a fence, caught him, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of a police car where a camera recorded what happened next.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Williams</h4><p begin="00:20:34.87" data-timestamp="1234.87">[INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 8</h4><p begin="00:20:35.33" data-timestamp="1235.33">What's your last name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Williams</h4><p begin="00:20:37.14" data-timestamp="1237.14">I can't breathe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 8</h4><p begin="00:20:39.37" data-timestamp="1239.37">You're breathing just fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Williams</h4><p begin="00:20:41.82" data-timestamp="1241.82">Believe me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 8</h4><p begin="00:20:44.27" data-timestamp="1244.27">What's your last name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek Williams</h4><p begin="00:20:47.71" data-timestamp="1247.71">I can't breathe, Sir.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Police Officer 8</h4><p begin="00:20:52.14" data-timestamp="1252.14">You're just playing games.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:20:57.59" data-timestamp="1257.59">The video is horrible to watch.

A few minutes later in the video, you see police administering CPR, but it was too late. Derek Williams died in the back of a squad car as he pleaded for medical help. It was Milwaukee's own Eric Garner video three years before it happened in New York. And through all the investigations, Chief Flynn defended the officers involved and they continued on active duty. People were furious. They protested, demanded that the state press criminal charges against the officers, demanded that the chief resign. Amazingly, Flynn says when he and other commanders first watched the video, they did not foresee that reaction.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:22:03.83" data-timestamp="1323.83">Our first thought when that tape was finished was breathing a sigh of relief. Well gosh, the cops didn't do anything to him. And of course, what we're completely missing is that an average person seeing that tape is perceiving absolutely uncaring, unfeeling officers who refused to do anything about a man in distress, and we missed it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:22:23.40" data-timestamp="1343.4">Flynn says part of the disconnect stemmed from the fact that the video camera was infrared, so people watching it after the fact could see Derek Williams in a way the officers couldn't in the moment because it was dark. But the biggest problem, he says, is that he took for granted that the public would understand his reasoning for not disciplining the officers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:22:41.12" data-timestamp="1361.12">You know, in hindsight, one recognizes it's difficult to explain the universe of police officers in crisis situations and how often an average officer encounters an arrested suspect who doesn't want to go to jail and wants to go to the hospital.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:23:00.73" data-timestamp="1380.73">That specific scenario happens a lot?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:23:02.76" data-timestamp="1382.76">Exactly. I can't breathe, I have something wrong with me, I have a pain. And after a while, it becomes just part of the noise of making an arrest and officers get a little inured to it. Now, that's not something the public wants to hear the police chief try to explain when a young man just dropped dead in the back of a car, and so the lesson that was clear to us is if you say you can't breathe, OK, we're calling an ambulance.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:23:27.27" data-timestamp="1407.27">You changed the policy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:23:28.14" data-timestamp="1408.14">We changed the policy. We made it mandatory.

You know, you look at this and it's kind of like, wouldn't it be basic human decency to respond to someone who's in distress like that or asking for help like that? And I wonder if you think that incident points to some kind of lack of empathy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:24:08.41" data-timestamp="1448.41">Cops start out empathetic or they wouldn't be doing this in the first place. You come to a police academy graduation, you talk to officers in training. They're dying to get out there and help people. But as the social net has frayed, cops are spending enormous amounts of time with the social problems that society's taken a walk on, and night after night after night, police officers go through the same problems for which there are no solutions.</p><p begin="00:24:36.33" data-timestamp="1476.33">The people that are police officers are regular people just like you, and they have faced the same kind of long term stresses on their equilibrium that anybody who is deployed year after year after year to Iraq and Afghanistan experiences. It happens more rapidly in a war zone, obviously, but the same dynamics are working on America's police officers every day on the streets of our cities, and they do harden themselves. They have to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:25:05.93" data-timestamp="1505.93">One thing Flynn says he's doing to try to rebuild empathy, he's trying to get cops on foot patrols at least an hour a shift so they can have friendly interactions with people who aren't in bad situations. Assistant Chief James Harpole says cynicism is especially dangerous to cops on third shift from midnight to 8:00 AM. He worked that shift for four years and he remembers the moment he realized he'd become jaded. It was when he got switched to second shift in the afternoons.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Harpole</h4><p begin="00:25:32.50" data-timestamp="1532.5">My first day working second shift was an eye opening experience for me. I'm driving down the street in the very same neighborhood I patrolled on third shift, and I see families, people pushing their babies, people waving at us as we were driving down the street. It shocked me. I was in shock. I had not experienced that. I realized at that very moment that the area that I was patrolling had an overwhelming majority of hardworking, outstanding individuals who wanted to have safe neighborhoods.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:26:06.89" data-timestamp="1566.89">That hadn't occurred to you before, for real?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Harpole</h4><p begin="00:26:08.68" data-timestamp="1568.68">Because I didn't deal with people like that. Before you even made it out of the station house, the dispatcher was sending you to the first fight and everybody was drunk and blood everywhere. So no, I hadn't even begun to think, is there anybody that's not like this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:26:29.85" data-timestamp="1589.85">Harpole says working second shift completely changed his mindset for dealing with people on the job. I asked Chief Flynn if they ever change people's shifts with this in mind, rotate cops to give them different perspectives on a neighborhood, and he said they can't because the union contract doesn't allow them to. I told him it seemed like, from Harpole's story, there might be value in it. He said, yeah, there'd be value in renegotiating the contract, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:00.41" data-timestamp="1620.41">Brian Reed.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:14.52" data-timestamp="1634.52">It's <i>This American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. This week and next on our show, "Cops See Things Differently," stories of policing and race. We're telling the story today of Chief Ed Flynn's tenure at the Milwaukee police department and how he's trying to improve relations between the police and black residents. One of the challenges he faced was he wanted to start a program that would basically be Milwaukee's version of the stop and frisk program, which is so controversial in New York City. Stop and frisk, of course, was policemen stopping pedestrians, but in Milwaukee, people drive, so lots of the stops were traffic stops. Again, here's Brian Reed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:27:47.27" data-timestamp="1667.27">When Chief Flynn looked at the data from Milwaukee, he saw that when officers pulled over people in high crime areas more frequently for minor violations like having a taillight out or running a stop sign, car thefts went down. Flynn believed more stops would mean fewer crimes, so he wanted to do more stops, but somehow without angering people or alienating them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:28:07.66" data-timestamp="1687.66">I also wanted to make sure we didn't accidentally enact a poor person's tax. If I'm going to put the cops on the hot spots and say enforce traffic laws because I really want to reduce robberies and car thefts, but I'm writing everybody tickets, how much good did I do myself? Maybe I'm going to reduce the number car thefts, but everybody hates us. So the order that implemented this policy said give warnings if you possibly can. The preferred outcome is a warning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:28:30.37" data-timestamp="1710.37">The number of traffic stops in Milwaukee almost quadrupled and the number of times officers stopped pedestrians tripled. And, like Flynn wanted, he says fewer than 20% of the traffic stops resulted in citation or arrest. Car thefts and robberies decreased, and Flynn saw an added benefit. Citizen complaints dropped, too. He thinks that's because more people were having good interactions with the cops, and there are numbers on this. A University of Wisconsin Milwaukee study that came out last month found that more than 60% of people who'd been approached by police during traffic stops said they were satisfied with how the officer handled the interaction.</p><p begin="00:29:09.27" data-timestamp="1749.27">But it was also during these traffic stops and pedestrian stops that one of the biggest scandals of Flynn's tenure as police chief happened. Dozens of people are now suing the department. One of them is Brandon Graham. Brandon is 25 years old. He says he started getting stopped back sometime in 2011, about three years into Flynn's push to increase stops. The way Brandon remembers it, one day he went back to a neighborhood he used to live in on the north side of Milwaukee, and his friends kept telling him how the cops in that district, district five, had been harassing them constantly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:29:40.92" data-timestamp="1780.92">I didn't really take it serious what they were saying. I'm thinking, like, you guys were doing something wrong to be stopped by the police. There's no police officer that's going to waste their time in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where there's a lot of crime, to stop you from walking down the street.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:29:57.60" data-timestamp="1797.6">Brandon's naivete lasted for all of two hours. Sure enough, he says, that very afternoon, the cops came by.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:30:03.62" data-timestamp="1803.62">We all stopped. I had no worries. I thought they were maybe looking for someone else, and I'm sure that it's not legal for the cops just to pull up and just pat you down with no probable cause. So we were all sitting there, and they asked me my name or whatever, asked me for my ID. I'm like, OK. I give them my ID or whatever. I'm like, is there any type of problems? They tell me to shut the F up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:30:26.85" data-timestamp="1826.85">A warning. This gets explicit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:30:28.76" data-timestamp="1828.76">He grabbed my pants and pulled them up to almost where I was on my tiptoes, and once he did that, he rubbed his hand from the front all the way to the back, from my testicles to my buttocks back and forth. So I'm like, what's going on? I'm not understanding why this is happening. It seemed as though they were trying their best to intimidate us, how they were talking to everyone end and not waiting for an answer. And like I said, it's only the first time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:31:03.23" data-timestamp="1863.23">Soon after, Brandon ended up moving back to that neighborhood, and the random stops continued in the same style as that first one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:31:09.63" data-timestamp="1869.63">So wait. How many times has this happened to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:31:12.39" data-timestamp="1872.39">It's happened almost every single day, like a couple years, every day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:31:18.85" data-timestamp="1878.85">One night, I spent time with Brandon and some of his friends back in district five. Brandon doesn't live there anymore, but they got to reminiscing about officers from the neighborhood, and listen to how well they knew them. It's like they're talking about old high school classmates or something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:31:32.64" data-timestamp="1892.64">You talking about the short, fat one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>P</h4><p begin="00:31:33.38" data-timestamp="1893.38">No, the little short white dude.

That's probably [INAUDIBLE] Letterman. Vag was probably in the green car that night. Because didn't Vag use to be in a white detail car?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>P</h4><p begin="00:31:52.09" data-timestamp="1912.09">Yeah. That's the car he pulled in the driveway in, my aunt's driveway.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:31:55.60" data-timestamp="1915.6">They're saying "Vag," short for Officer Michael Vagnini, the most notorious cop in the district at the time, and maybe all of Milwaukee. This is Brandon's friend P remembering the night officer Vagnini followed him into his aunt and uncle's driveway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>P</h4><p begin="00:32:09.32" data-timestamp="1929.32">[INAUDIBLE] walked all in her house. It's two something in the morning, walked all in the house, searched the house. Walked in my uncle's room. He's just getting out of the shower, butt ass naked. Oh yeah, man, put some clothes on. Fuck out of here, nigga. This ain't your motherfucking house. Get the fuck out. My uncle snapped, saying, do you got a search warrant? He said, let me put my clothes on. Let me call your sergeant and see if this is OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:32:33.88" data-timestamp="1953.88">It was this officer, Michael Vagnini, who Brandon says was responsible for the worst night of his life. He and some friends were in the car and a group of officers pulled them over. In court documents, the police say it was because they ran a stop sign and were missing a side mirror. They asked Brandon and his friends to get out of car. One officer patted Brandon down, then another. Again, Brandon's description is graphic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:32:55.48" data-timestamp="1975.48">Vagnini then was saying, I'm not a rookie, and then searched me. He stuck his hands in my boxers from the back first around my rectum area, and then reached around the front and kind of moved around my testicles. And the whole time, I'm having to hold my hands up, and every time I dropped my hands, he threatened me, you know, like if you drop your hands anymore, I'll kick you in the forehead. The whole time, I'm begging, please, Vag, you're touching my ass, you're touching my ass. You have your fingers around my butt hole. You're scratching me. You're lifting my testicles. It brought tears to my eyes because it's like, what can I do about this? When is it going to stop? The other officers are standing right there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:33:49.27" data-timestamp="2029.27">Brandon says Officer Vagnini then pulled out a knife and cut open the waistband of his pants, where Brandon had two bags of cocaine. The officers arrested Brandon. He plead guilty to a misdemeanor possession charge. In the criminal complaint, the police say that Brandon consented to a search of his person. There's no description of the search.</p><p begin="00:34:11.60" data-timestamp="2051.6">Almost a year later, in 2012, Chief Flynn and the district attorney announced that they were investigating a pattern of complaints from the previous couple years about illegal searches, including illegal strip searches and cavity searches. Flynn asked any residents with information or complaints to call Internal Affairs. Three officers eventually plead no contest to being party to the illegal searches and were given community service. One went to jail for 20 days.</p><p begin="00:34:37.71" data-timestamp="2077.71">Officer Vagnini plead no contest to four counts of illegal cavity searches and misconduct in public office. He was sentenced to a little more than two years in prison. For his sentencing, dozens of police officers wrote letters supporting him, saying his only crime was overzealousness in keeping the community safe from criminals. They called him exemplary, one of the best cops in the city, the kind of officer they wanted to be.</p><p begin="00:35:01.56" data-timestamp="2101.56">But Vagnini's trial wasn't the end of it. About 60 people are now suing the department claiming they were also illegally searched. They name at least 40 officers and allege that supervisors looked the other way or ignored complaints.</p><p begin="00:35:15.14" data-timestamp="2115.14">A Milwaukee civil rights attorney who represented Frank Jude told me he'd been getting calls complaining about illegal searches for years before the chief announced his investigation. Even though he believed many of them and started to notice patterns involving specific officers, he couldn't prove the claims. Safran says a man who contacted him 10 years ago about an illegal search called him recently and said I told you so. Safran says some of the people who reported this behavior are still in prison because of the searches they say were illegal.</p><p begin="00:35:50.01" data-timestamp="2150.01">It probably goes without saying that Brandon is one of the many black Milwaukeeans who has not been won over by Chief Flynn's campaign to build trust. I asked him and his friend Rex if they could picture a scenario in which they'd ever call the cops for help, if they got robbed at gunpoint, for instance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:36:05.02" data-timestamp="2165.02">You're asking if we're going to call the police?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:36:06.29" data-timestamp="2166.29">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:36:07.26" data-timestamp="2167.26">No. You would call the police, Rex?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rex</h4><p begin="00:36:08.78" data-timestamp="2168.78">Hell no. Hell motherfucking no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brandon Graham</h4><p begin="00:36:11.46" data-timestamp="2171.46">[INAUDIBLE] the police.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:36:14.77" data-timestamp="2174.77">Chief Flynn told me when he learned about the illegal searches and the cavity searches, he was furious and disappointed. He says this was a small, isolated group of officers who slipped into a game of getting the, quote, "bad guys" at all costs. But he also says he's skeptical of the people coming forward now claiming they were illegally searched and suing because of it. He called the lawsuits a cottage industry. He says the department only ever got three complaints and they were all from drug dealers who had been frequently arrested.</p><p begin="00:36:45.53" data-timestamp="2205.53">One thing that surprised me talking to Flynn, especially because he's such a student of history, was what he said when I asked him about the issue that's at the center of so many conversations about policing, race.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:36:56.75" data-timestamp="2216.75">At the level of cop working in the neighborhood, race is irrelevant. It's just people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:37:04.96" data-timestamp="2224.96">Flynn says that whenever there's an incident between a white officer and a black resident, people get upset and say it's racism, but he says they're missing the big picture. So for instance, in 2011, The <i>Milwaukee</i> <i>Journal</i> <i>Sentinel</i> did a story where a data reporter looked at police records and found that black drivers in the city were seven times more likely than white drivers to be stopped by police. In response, Flynn did a whole presentation for residents with maps and crime numbers where he told them the same thing he told me, that the disparity isn't because of officers' bias against black residents. It's just that the majority of crimes happen in neighborhoods that are overwhelmingly African American.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ed Flynn</h4><p begin="00:37:45.85" data-timestamp="2265.85">And people come and say, we're shocked, shocked to find out the police are intervening so much in this neighborhood. What? What? Of course our interventions are going to generate disparities. I mean, they're going to match the disparities of where our crimes and victims are.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:38:03.87" data-timestamp="2283.87">That may explain the statistics, but what I wanted to know was doesn't race play a role in those interventions? Only 17% of the Milwaukee police force is black in an incredibly segregated city. I told Flynn there's evidence that race can influence the way cops deal with black residents. Some of this we're going to talk about more in next week's show. There's research about people's implicit biases, subconscious racism that can affect officers' decisions.</p><p begin="00:38:30.57" data-timestamp="2310.57">But there's also evidence in Chief Flynn's own department, according to that <i>Journal</i> <i>Sentinel</i> story, which showed that the largest disparity between blacks and whites getting pulled over in Milwaukee didn't happen in high crime black areas of the city, but in the two lowest crime districts, both with predominantly white populations. The paper also found that once black drivers were pulled over, they were twice as likely as white drivers to have police search their cars, even though that didn't lead to finding more drugs or weapons.

And it's upsetting if you've just been shot at to have the police come and interrogate you like you're the criminal. And on top of that, there's the history, all the times the cops haven't treated people fairly or worse. That's always there, casting a shadow over every interaction.

On April 30 last year, a white Milwaukee police officer shot and killed a black man named Dontre Hamilton. He was sleeping in a plaza across from City Hall in the afternoon, and an employee from a nearby Starbucks called the police. Two officers checked on Hamilton and determined he wasn't doing anything wrong. Then a different cop, the beat cop for the area, Officer Christopher Manny, came and roused him and tried to pat him down. This led to some kind of altercation. According to officer Manny and some witnesses, Hamilton grabbed his baton and hit him in the neck with it. Manny says he feared for his life. He shot Hamilton 14 times. Hamilton was 31 years old and had suffered from schizophrenia.</p><p begin="00:51:05.88" data-timestamp="3065.88">And unlike after the death of Derek Williams, the man in the back of a squad car who couldn't breathe, Chief Flynn fired officer Manny, though he didn't fire him for killing Hamilton. He fired him for doing a pat down that was against department policy and not in line with his training. Flynn says Officer Manny could tell when he approached that Hamilton was in the midst of a mental health issue, which means he should have never tried to touch him. That's rule number one when dealing with someone in a mental health crisis. And by trying to pat him down, Flynn says, Manny created the situation in which he feared for his life and ended up killing Dontre Hamilton.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:51:40.32" data-timestamp="3100.32">It was [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:51:41.81" data-timestamp="3101.81">It was murder.

I was there. People packed into a senior center gymnasium. On the right, members of the police union, almost entirely white. On the left, Dontre Hamilton's family and supporters, largely black and brown.</p><p begin="00:52:10.18" data-timestamp="3130.18">For an hour, Chief Flynn and the commission sat silently on stage as supporters of Dontre Hamilton berated them. They were angry that Flynn had taken six months to make a decision about Manny's firing, that he'd announced it two days after Manny had filed for disability, which meant he could still get paid, and that under a new state law, what was supposed to be an independent investigation into Dontre Hamilton's death had been done by former Milwaukee police officers. On the other side, the police union members were furious that Flynn would even consider suspending Officer Manny, never mind firing him, for doing what union president Mike Crivello said any reasonable officer would do in that situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Crivello</h4><p begin="00:52:49.89" data-timestamp="3169.89">When the situation created the necessity for the use of a deadly force, PO Manny did what he had to.

We are saddened by the loss of Mr. Hamilton. We have compassion for the family.

They both wanted Chief Flynn gone. Dontre Hamilton's supporters had issued a demand for his resignation, and the union had recently held a no confidence vote, where 99% of the cops who showed up had voted against the chief. At one point during the public comments, Chief Flynn began to look down at his lap. He was checking this phone. People shouted at him, saying how dare he, saying he was being insensitive.

We are responsible for the things we get wrong and we take action. We've arrested cops, we've fired cops, and so on. But when you start getting yelled at for reading the updates of the kid that got shot, yeah, you take it personal, OK? Now no offense, but I'm going up there now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:55:51.11" data-timestamp="3351.11">If you're going to repair the relationship between African Americans and the police, at least the way Chief Flynn is trying to, it's going to happen in the course of thousands of encounters between cops and black residents, thousands of encounters that need to go well, and even if they do, each one still only brings you one small step closer to building trust. It's a game of inches.</p><p begin="00:56:13.84" data-timestamp="3373.84">Right now, according to that University of Wisconsin survey, 63% of black Milwaukeeans say they're satisfied with police, versus 83% of white Milwaukeeans. Remember Trina, the woman whose neighbor shot at her and her boyfriend? On paper, her case looks like a success for the Milwaukee police. They arrested the shooter, confiscated the gun, and on top of that, they helped Trina out, offered to stand guard while Trina and her boyfriend moved out of the apartment building that day to make sure the neighbor's cousins didn't do anything to them. Trina thanked the officers before they left, and still, when we talked about if she trusted the Milwaukee PD, she said--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trina</h4><p begin="00:56:52.51" data-timestamp="3412.51">I don't really. It's a 50/50 chance, you know what I'm saying? 50/50.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:56:58.37" data-timestamp="3418.37">50/50 chance of what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trina</h4><p begin="00:57:00.20" data-timestamp="3420.2">Like sometimes they help people, sometimes they wouldn't. You know what I'm saying? That was the grace of god that they found that gun.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:57:09.59" data-timestamp="3429.59">Sometimes they'll help you and sometimes they won't?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Trina</h4><p begin="00:57:11.36" data-timestamp="3431.36">Yeah. They won't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:57:20.93" data-timestamp="3440.93">Trina is not the only black Milwaukeean who said something like this to me. I asked one woman what she thought of the Milwaukee PD and she put it like this. You just don't know what to expect. That stayed with me. She wasn't saying all cops are racist or the whole force is corrupt. She was saying something much more measured, that the police are unpredictable, which means at least this woman felt that when you have an interaction with a cop, you can never be sure what you're going to get.</p></div> </div>
