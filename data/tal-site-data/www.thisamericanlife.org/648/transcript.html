<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.78" data-timestamp="0.78"> So, you may have heard that last week, Starbucks closed down all of their US stores so they could do this big racial bias training program for everybody who worked at Starbucks-- the same training at every store Starbucks owns, 8,000 stores, over 175,000 people-- a very eccentric corporate move that the company embarked on after an incident in Starbucks in Philadelphia in April that you probably heard about. Two African-American men were sitting there, calmly waiting for a friend. The manager called the police, who arrested them as customers asked why.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:30.31" data-timestamp="30.31"> Well, what did they do? What did they do? Someone tell me what they did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:00:33.99" data-timestamp="33.99"> They didn't do anything. I saw the entire thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:35.64" data-timestamp="35.64"> Here's what they did. They wanted to use the bathroom, but they hadn't bought anything. The manager said no. She asked them to leave. When they wouldn't leave, because they were there to meet somebody, the manager called the police.</p><p begin="00:00:49.77" data-timestamp="49.77">Two days after this, the company said that what happened was reprehensible, that calling the police was completely inappropriate, that the company stands firmly against racial profiling. And then it went further and announced this training, which would shut down the stores for half a day and cost them tens of millions of dollars. That is not what companies normally do. Normally, when this kind of thing happens, companies either deny they did anything wrong, or they accept they did something wrong, and then they move on. Like, they move on quickly. Moving on quickly is the key.</p><p begin="00:01:20.88" data-timestamp="80.88">But here, Starbucks was taking this incident that was bad press for them from the start and they decided to kind of own it and sit with it and live in it. And they more or less declared, we have a problem with racism in this country. And our answer to Philadelphia is that Starbucks is not only going to try to fix its own racism problem, it's going to try to help fix America's racism problem, too-- which, I have to say, is basically just inviting people from all sides to criticize them.</p><p begin="00:01:47.91" data-timestamp="107.91">And then the thing that they do is the biggest implicit bias training that's happened ever in all time. People argue about the effectiveness of implicit bias training anyway. I'm just trying to say, Starbucks made a very unusual choice.</p><p begin="00:02:01.22" data-timestamp="121.22">Well, Kelefa Sanneh has been examining that choice for us. And he went to attend the training itself, which we're going to get to. Our show is the only journalistic outfit that Starbucks allowed to attend one of these trainings, and we did record there. That's coming up.</p><p begin="00:02:13.42" data-timestamp="133.42">Kelefa is normally a staff writer for The New Yorker. Hey, Kelefa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:02:15.70" data-timestamp="135.7"> Hey, Ira.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:16.42" data-timestamp="136.42"> OK, so the thing that I personally wonder about is, OK, in a purely practical way, if Starbucks wanted their employees to not do racist stuff or racial profile anybody anymore, a training like this seems so, like, squishy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:02:28.98" data-timestamp="148.98"> Mhm, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:30.25" data-timestamp="150.25"> Who knows if this even works? Why not do the most old-fashioned thing out there? If they really care about this, why don't they just fire the manager, tell everybody else, OK, here's a new rule, do stuff like that, you lose your job, and then just call it a day?</p><p begin="00:02:43.65" data-timestamp="163.65">People were calling for them to fire the manager for a while. They were protests demanding that. And they didn't do it. Why do this experimental, weird thing instead? Why not just fire the racists?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:02:54.35" data-timestamp="174.35"> So I talked to Howard Schultz. He's the guy who built Starbucks-- basically the Steve Jobs of Starbucks-- about why they didn't do the simple thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:03:01.56" data-timestamp="181.56"> Well, I think if you're asking, would it have been easier to fire the manager on the spot, I guess it would have been easier. But it's just not the way we view the culture and values of Starbucks.</p><p begin="00:03:12.98" data-timestamp="192.98">I felt strongly that this was not a time to blame one individual, that the policy was too much in a gray area. And we had not given the proper tools and resources for the manager to make the right decision. And ultimately, we were responsible, the company and myself. And that's the position we've taken.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:35.56" data-timestamp="215.56"> And just to be clear, the manager, at this point, is not working for Starbucks, though they will not say whether or not they fired her. The company said-- and this is a quote-- that it was a mutual decision for her to go. So when this happens, they don't make a show of firing her and setting new rules.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:03:50.61" data-timestamp="230.61"> No. Instead, the company says it's going to help lead this national conversation about race that we always hear about. I talked to Howard Schultz about this plan, this idealistic, optimistic vision of racial healing and progress. And actually, he got kind of defensive about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:04.81" data-timestamp="244.81"> Really?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:04:05.99" data-timestamp="245.99"> Yeah. Like, when I asked him what seemed like a pretty obvious question about the Philadelphia thing-- I asked him, how often does this kind of thing happen in your stores? And he didn't know. He said Starbucks doesn't keep track.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:04:16.35" data-timestamp="256.35"> If we're going to spend time on this call talking about how often police are called to Starbucks, I think it's not what we should be talking about. We should be talking about, what kind of country do we want to live in? And what can we do as a company, what can we do as citizens, to enhance the lives of all Americans? And I think it's a courageous step on our part to talk about a difficult subject.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:04:42.73" data-timestamp="282.73"> Howard Schultz loves these big, dramatic gestures. You might remember in 2008, during the Obama-McCain presidential race, Starbucks buys this ad on Saturday Night Live saying, if you vote, you can come into Starbucks, get a free cup of coffee.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:55.44" data-timestamp="295.44"> Yeah, I kind of vaguely remember that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:04:57.28" data-timestamp="297.28"> Yeah, he has a term for initiatives like these. He calls them "brand sparks."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:01.01" data-timestamp="301.01"> Brand sparks?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:05:02.87" data-timestamp="302.87"> Yeah. He defines it in one of his books. He says brand sparks are "subtle, surprising, and rare marketing events usually linked to cultural or humanitarian issues and devoid of a self-serving sales pitch."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:14.64" data-timestamp="314.64"> Oh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:05:15.52" data-timestamp="315.52"> That election ad, he said it worked. He said it generated goodwill for Starbucks. He said it gave the brand a halo. But this-- he said that this racism initiative-- he said this was different.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:05:25.08" data-timestamp="325.08"> But this has nothing to do with 2008. So I don't know why you keep going back to the brand spark.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:05:29.00" data-timestamp="329"> Well, I--</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:05:29.72" data-timestamp="329.72"> Yeah. When I suggested this to Howard, that this racial bias training thing had something to do with marketing Starbucks, he didn't go for it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:05:38.96" data-timestamp="338.96"> Certainly, our customers are going to notice that our stores are closed. And there's been a fair amount of press about it. But it's not anything that we are promoting to send a message.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:05:51.70" data-timestamp="351.7"> I want to make sure I understand this. You say this is not a marketing event. And obviously, to some people, anything that a company does kind of looks like marketing. How is this different from a marketing event?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:06:04.65" data-timestamp="364.65"> This is the antithesis of a marketing event. It's not something that is-- it has nothing to do with trying to sell anything. Marketing is about creating awareness and selling your product. This is not-- we're not trying to sell anything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:06:21.74" data-timestamp="381.74"> This conversation with Howard Schultz, it happened right before the training. That's where I was supposed to go after our interview, which was supposed to last, like, half an hour.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:06:30.52" data-timestamp="390.52"> What does--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:06:31.62" data-timestamp="391.62"> Are we almost done?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:06:32.74" data-timestamp="392.74"> What's that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Howard Schultz</h4><p begin="00:06:34.23" data-timestamp="394.23"> I think we're almost done.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:06:36.26" data-timestamp="396.26"> I think we're at-- we're at 15 minutes, right?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:06:38.98" data-timestamp="398.98"> So, he didn't hang up on me. We kept talking. But once we were done, my producer and I, we get a call from a Starbucks PR rep saying, basically, look, if this is going to be some sort of gotcha piece about how this whole thing is a big marketing event, we might not be interested in participating.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:57.02" data-timestamp="417.02"> Well, it's weird, because there's nothing wrong with marketing. Like, they're doing a thing. They want people to know. Marketing is what companies do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:07:02.46" data-timestamp="422.46"> Sure. They never really stop doing it, right? Marketing is sort of just a word for anything that a company does to tell the world about who it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:09.45" data-timestamp="429.45"> OK. All right, here's the theory. Is it possible that he is so insistent that there's no marketing in it because, yeah, he knows that anything his company does publicly affects how the public sees his brand. Like, of course doing anything like this is a kind of marketing.</p><p begin="00:07:23.41" data-timestamp="443.41">But he doesn't want to admit it because actually, underneath it, he actually is trying to do a good thing. He's trying to actually address racism. He thinks America is too racist. He wants to do something about it. And he just feels like, oh, if we start admitting that there's some marketing, or we get some brand halo from this, that's just going to muddy the message.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:07:41.38" data-timestamp="461.38"> Yeah, although what's weird is, this isn't the first time Starbucks has tried to do a good thing, right? They've had environmental initiatives. They had this voting thing, which he was happy to say the voting thing was good marketing. So in a sense, this isn't new for Starbucks.</p><p begin="00:07:54.31" data-timestamp="474.31">But what is new is that this is a racism initiative. And I think he has a sense that racism is so incendiary, so sensitive, that it can't have anything to do with marketing. Like, if there's any sense that this has anything to do with marketing Starbucks, people are going to tune it out or maybe worse, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:11.26" data-timestamp="491.26"> Right, because it would be offensive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:08:12.78" data-timestamp="492.78"> Yeah, this idea, like, you're taking America's national sin of racism and using that to sell coffee. People might consider that offensive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:20.92" data-timestamp="500.92"> OK, but if he really is trying to do something good here, then to put this thing together, he worked with-- I read this in the paper, the people who you would turn to if you were serious about doing a big anti-bias training. There's, like, Bryan Stevenson--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:08:32.25" data-timestamp="512.25"> Yeah, Bryan Stevenson from the Equal Justice Initiative.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:34.81" data-timestamp="514.81"> Sherrilyn Iffil, I read.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:08:35.91" data-timestamp="515.91"> Yeah, she runs the Legal Defense Fund at the NAACP.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:38.92" data-timestamp="518.92"> And then, less than a week after this big training, this other thing happens-- Howard Schultz quits his job at Starbucks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:08:45.64" data-timestamp="525.64"> Right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:46.15" data-timestamp="526.15"> And there's all this speculation. Is he going run for president? And he doesn't deny whether or not he's going to run for President. He's just like, I'm going to do public service.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:08:53.56" data-timestamp="533.56"> Howard Schultz for president, right?

<div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:37.17" data-timestamp="577.17"> Act One, All the Caffeine in the World Doesn't Make You Woke. So when Starbucks gave us permission to record at their big national training last week, they did put conditions on this-- all kinds of conditions. They would not let us record the training at one of their stores. It had to be at their corporate headquarters. They would select the participants.</p><p begin="00:09:58.20" data-timestamp="598.2">So this is not going to be typical in a lot of ways. But we will get to see what the training actually is and to see whether it had any kind of impact on the group of people who we figured, given the circumstances, would be a group of employees predisposed to be into this. We figured, if this training didn't do much for them, what kind of chance was it that it was going to be any better out in the stores? And if it did work for them, well then, maybe that would be interesting in some way, also.</p><p begin="00:10:23.26" data-timestamp="623.26">We honestly did not know what to expect. But we wanted to understand, OK, here's this big company that says it's trying to do this idealistic thing, take on all racial relations in America. And OK, let's take them at their word and try to understand. What did it look like when they tried to do that?</p><p begin="00:10:38.31" data-timestamp="638.31">The employees at this particular training were not big, like, vice presidents, not the people in charge of the company. These were mostly mid-level managers from the supply chain, and operations, and human resources parts of the company. And most of them used to work in the stores as baristas. Kelefa now explains what he saw at that training.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:10:55.40" data-timestamp="655.4"> This was happening in 8,000 stores. And they couldn't hire 8,000 racial bias experts to lead the sessions.

But the only time the materials mentioned the incident itself was to explain why the training was happening. Instead, the training zoomed way out, tackling racial bias and discrimination more generally.

It feels rude to sit down with someone and jump into race, as if that's what's on your mind, as if that's how you see them. But there's a training for that, and we're at it.</p><p begin="00:14:53.47" data-timestamp="893.47">So here's how it worked. It was basically broken into three sections. This format was created with help from the Perception Institute, a group that does this kind of anti-bias work. There are three sections of the training. First, acknowledging that we're all different and talking about what it takes to make everyone feel like they belong.</p><p begin="00:15:11.53" data-timestamp="911.53">Second, recognizing bias in ourselves. Here's how they defined it-- implicit bias, that's the automatic stereotyping we do. Structural bias, that's the way systems and institutions perpetuate inequality.</p><p begin="00:15:25.64" data-timestamp="925.64">Third, Starbucks policies. This was more about the nuts and bolts of actually running a coffee shop. In response to Philadelphia, the company made some changes, like the bathroom policy. Now, everyone can use the bathroom at Starbucks. You don't have to buy anything.</p><p begin="00:15:43.04" data-timestamp="943.04">Parts of the training felt generic, like a run-of-the-mill corporate diversity seminar. And some parts were super specific to Starbucks, tackling forms of bias that no one outside Starbucks has ever considered. Here's a scenario from one of the videos.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:15:56.38" data-timestamp="956.38"> But we always knew that in our store, about 3:10 PM, we would get a huge rush of high school students right when school would let out. And then we always had the one person on the floor that kind of turned and looked, and was like, oh, great, here it comes, frappuccino happy hour. And so as these kids were in the store, yeah, they're a little bit rambunctious. But you start taking their orders.</p><p begin="00:16:19.44" data-timestamp="979.44">You come to realize that it's like you made a huge assumption. Not every drink's a frappuccino. Somebody is ordering a hot chocolate. Somebody is getting a caramel macchiato. Somebody likes passion tea with, like, 10 pumps classic. Like, there's just--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:16:29.49" data-timestamp="989.49"> I guess that's an example of beverage bias, or maybe frappuccino shaming. There were also videos about baristas assuming patrons were homeless. One was about gender identity. One was about a barista who suspected that a group of black kids was plotting to steal the tip jar. One was about a guy with an accent so thick that the barista couldn't spell his name on his cup.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:16:51.62" data-timestamp="1011.62"> --about it, and said, I'm just going to call you Bob.

And despite the uneasiness at first, there actually was some blunt talk about race in the group discussions, mainly because there was one person there who seemed totally comfortable talking about it. Her name was Adrienne. She's an engineer working on the global supply chain.</p><p begin="00:17:56.52" data-timestamp="1076.52">She's African-American, grew up in Atlanta, moved to Seattle six years ago to work at Starbucks. And she admitted that for her, Starbucks wasn't always a super comfortable place to be. At one point, everyone broke up into small groups and talked about the company.

My--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:20:55.79" data-timestamp="1255.79"> There weren't a lot of moments like this, where people chimed in, added to each other's stories. Generally, everyone listened respectfully but quietly, like when Adrienne asked the group, why do white people care so much about black people's hair? Everyone laughed, but no one gave her an answer. In this group, it seemed like Adrienne was the only person trying to answer questions like that.</p><p begin="00:21:28.82" data-timestamp="1288.82">The closest they got to really discussing the Philadelphia incident was near the end. They were talking not about Philadelphia, but about something else-- something less charged, but kind of similar, that happened in one of the stores. There was a video of a store manager telling a story that sounded kind of like a confession.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manager</h4><p begin="00:21:45.56" data-timestamp="1305.56"> One day, in my store, I was on the register, and I was helping customers. And a couple of weeks prior to that, my manager had told me about the return policy, that customers needed a receipt, and it had to be within the last 60 days. This older black man came up to the register with a pound of coffee and he asked to return it. And I asked him if he got a receipt, and he said no.</p><p begin="00:22:05.88" data-timestamp="1325.88">Now, I'd seen other partners in the store accept returns without a receipt in the past. And I'd even done that before, as well. But for some reason, I just really stuck to the policy and leveraged the policy as the reason why I couldn't give him money back or make an exchange without a receipt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adrienne</h4><p begin="00:22:21.65" data-timestamp="1341.65"> I think what bothers me is that this guy we're talking about with the coffee said he had broken the rules before. For some reason, he didn't do it for an older black man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:22:32.32" data-timestamp="1352.32"> This is Adrienne again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adrienne</h4><p begin="00:22:33.51" data-timestamp="1353.51"> That's what bothers me, is that you purposefully was like, there's a black guy that came in here. I'm not going to do it this time. This is the one time I'm going to let the rules work for me. That's the type of stuff that I just don't understand.</p><p begin="00:22:48.78" data-timestamp="1368.78">It's just like, what in the world did this black person do to you to make you just-- I don't know. It's weird when you grow up, and you wonder, like, why do these people hate me so much? And I literally have done nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:23:02.89" data-timestamp="1382.89"> The training manual had talked about unconscious bias. But Adrienne thought that what this guy did, it sounded more like conscious bias, an intentionally racist act. Whitney, the white operations manager-- she wasn't so sure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Whitney</h4><p begin="00:23:17.40" data-timestamp="1397.4"> I think it can be truly unconscious, though.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:23:20.86" data-timestamp="1400.86"> And she suggested, very politely, that Adrienne might be wrong about this guy-- that maybe this guy didn't realize in the moment what he was doing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Whitney</h4><p begin="00:23:29.19" data-timestamp="1409.19"> Sounds to me like, in retrospect, that person was like, yeah, I don't know why I dug my heels in so hard. But I think about it even as a parent, why-- like, sometimes I'll let certain things be fine. And other times, I like-- like, I'll look back later and go like, why was I so insistent on following the house rule on this one?</p><p begin="00:23:55.60" data-timestamp="1435.6">I think, probably, his thought process in the moment wasn't, I'm going to say no because this is a black person. But in retrospect, was like, why was that the time that I chose-- hm, well, I don't like what that says about me. That feels gross.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:24:12.27" data-timestamp="1452.27"> Then Rodney joined the conversation, even though he wasn't really sure how he felt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney</h4><p begin="00:24:17.72" data-timestamp="1457.72"> But it is-- for that scenario, I listened to you, and then I listened to you. And it's interesting to hear a black woman's response and a white woman's response, because what I heard from you was that there was intent. And there was knowing decision-- this is a black guy. I'm not going to take this.</p><p begin="00:24:31.46" data-timestamp="1471.46">And you want to give them the benefit of the doubt. And I'm torn. We don't know. And to be honest, I don't know what we do with that, as a company. I mean, like--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:24:38.39" data-timestamp="1478.39"> Rodney really believes in Starbucks. But at this moment, it felt like he was bumping up against the limits of this corporate initiative, like maybe he had finally encountered a problem that wasn't going to be solved by a friendly, non-judgmental listening session.</p><p begin="00:24:57.66" data-timestamp="1497.66">In practice, this epic social experiment, this attempt to lead a national conversation about race, this grandiose parting shot from Howard Schultz as he left this company that he built, did it help? It's hard to tell. Starbucks said it wasn't measuring outcomes. But in this one conference room in Seattle, it seemed sincere, maybe even helpful. It felt like Starbucks was trying to give people what they say they want after an incident like this-- accept responsibility, change your corporate culture, fight systemic racism all at once. And if it was kind of unwieldy, kind of incoherent, with a couple of moments of insight, what do you expect? It's a weird assignment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney</h4><p begin="00:25:38.21" data-timestamp="1538.21"> We're done?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Whitney</h4><p begin="00:25:39.51" data-timestamp="1539.51"> This is the last page. Want me to read it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rodney</h4><p begin="00:25:41.97" data-timestamp="1541.97"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Whitney</h4><p begin="00:25:42.54" data-timestamp="1542.54"> Today was a start. It was not perfect, because we are all human, and we are all learning.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kelefa Sanneh</h4><p begin="00:25:54.06" data-timestamp="1554.06"> The day of the training, May 29, while the group had been impaneled, the national conversation about race had been proceeding in the real world, although not in a way they would have predicted. While they were watching their videos and filling out their workbooks, Roseanne Barr, unbeknownst to them, was being condemned for a tweet in which she compared an African-American woman to an ape.</p><p begin="00:26:17.44" data-timestamp="1577.44">So by the time the session in Seattle was finished, Roseanne, not Starbucks, was the biggest story in the country. ABC did what Starbucks didn't do. They fired Roseanne, they issued a brief statement, and they tried to move on as quickly as possible. Starbucks, having hoped to harness one viral moment, had found its careful plans overshadowed by a different one.</p><p begin="00:26:39.74" data-timestamp="1599.74">On Twitter, people joked about how Roseanne could use some of that Starbucks sensitivity training. The company's big, idealistic vision became a punchline after someone else's racial screw-up. There are going to be more trainings for Starbucks employees over the next year, but the stores aren't going to shut down for them.</p><p begin="00:26:57.52" data-timestamp="1617.52">Starbucks has gone back to selling coffee. Wherever you are, chances are, there's one nearby. Go there right now if you want. Order a frappuccino. They'll try not to judge you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:10.69" data-timestamp="1630.69"> Kelefa Sanneh-- he's a staff writer for The New Yorker.

<h3>Act Two: Throw the Book at Them</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:25.97" data-timestamp="1645.97"> This American Life-- I'm Ira Glass. Today's program, "Unteachable Moment," stories about people who are supposed to learn some stuff that is really hard to learn, and then what happens instead of learning. We've arrived at Act Two of our show-- Act Two, Throw the Book at Them.</p><p begin="00:27:41.05" data-timestamp="1661.05">In New Orleans, the district attorney prosecutes a ton of kids as adults. Between 2011 and 2015, for instance, he sent approximately 80% of 15- and 16-year-olds into the adult criminal justice system in cases where he had the option of charging them as juveniles. That's according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p><p begin="00:27:57.70" data-timestamp="1677.7">These kids end up at the Orleans Justice Center, which is the jail that any adult in New Orleans Parish is held while waiting for trial. And in part because there are so many kids, and in part because some of them are in jail for so long, waiting for their court dates, they decided to open up a high school in the jail back last year in August. It's a real school, actually part of the New Orleans School District. You can get a real high school diploma there. And it looks like nearly any high school, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher</h4><p begin="00:28:22.81" data-timestamp="1702.81"> So gentlemen, I'm about to hand you these note cards. These are the--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:26.00" data-timestamp="1706"> In the hallway, there are motivational posters and student essays on the theme of power posted. There's a "Where are they now?" display with former students' pictures and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s mugshot from when he was in jail. But one big difference from regular school? The students are all in orange jumpsuits, stamped "INMATE" in all caps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher</h4><p begin="00:28:42.98" data-timestamp="1722.98"> What do parallel lines tell us?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Student</h4><p begin="00:28:44.97" data-timestamp="1724.97"> What you mean, what they tell us?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher</h4><p begin="00:28:47.36" data-timestamp="1727.36"> There's some information we can take from parallel lines, that we love about parallel lines.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:51.32" data-timestamp="1731.32"> At any given time, there are about 50 students enrolled in the school, which is named the Travis Hill School after a local musician who was incarcerated himself as a teenager. I should say that some of the students are 18 or over. So technically, they are adults.</p><p begin="00:29:05.35" data-timestamp="1745.35">But Travis Hill is different from schools in juvenile detention facilities because these kids, all of them, are charged as adults. They're all facing adult sentences, lots of them really long-- 10, 15, 25, 40 years-- and a lifelong criminal record. And all this raises a very particular problem for this school. Eli Hager, who reports on criminal justice issues at the Marshall Project, has been visiting the school.</p><p begin="00:29:28.28" data-timestamp="1768.28">Quick warning that we have un-beeped a few words here in the podcast version of the program. A beeped version is at our website. Here's Eli.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:29:33.86" data-timestamp="1773.86"> The problem is, being a student and being an inmate are opposites. Everything about adult jail is telling you to be hopeless, that you have no future and no worth, which makes school feel utterly beside the point. Of course, there are always kids in the back row of any classroom asking the question, when will we ever use this in real life? Especially in places where there truly isn't much opportunity, like at the mostly black schools that the kids at Travis Hill all came from.</p><p begin="00:29:59.67" data-timestamp="1799.67">But it's just more vivid here, the students' sense of the senselessness of school-- more total and more justified. Take this one kid, Ju'ron. He's 17 years old, and he's facing 15 to 104 years in prison for allegedly stealing a cell phone from a woman and firing a gun in the air. He says he didn't do it.</p><p begin="00:30:18.25" data-timestamp="1818.25">His mom can't afford bail. So until his trial, he's stuck in a place that's not safe. The death rate at the Orleans Justice Center is four times the national average for jails. Ju'ron calls his mom every day, but in-person visits aren't allowed here.</p><p begin="00:30:31.90" data-timestamp="1831.9">Sometimes, he gets locked in his cell for 23 hours a day and gets his feed up, as the guards call it, through a slot. He goes to sleep on a hard slab. And one day, on his way to art class, he walked past the man charged with killing his father just a few months earlier.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:30:45.86" data-timestamp="1845.86"> I was scared. He'd killed a man that looked like me. So I was glad he didn't see me. But I saw him. Now I know to keep an eye out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:30:55.71" data-timestamp="1855.71"> Do you remember how you were feeling when you were sitting in class after having just seen that person?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:31:04.43" data-timestamp="1864.43"> I was thinking, just thinking. I wasn't going nowhere-- in my head, no, no, no. I was like, am I tripping? I gotta get the fuck out of here. I can't do this no more. There's all type of stuff coming with jail, man. I can't do it.</p><p begin="00:31:18.30" data-timestamp="1878.3">School's not helping me. I mean, they're doing their thing. They're trying to help. They're trying hard. You know, I give school their prop, but it's not helping. What, I'm gonna face that by using math? Really?</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:31:31.35" data-timestamp="1891.35"> So last summer, the experiment began at Orleans Justice Center. Could a violent adult jail contain an aspirational school? Every day, its students, all of whom are black, would grapple with whether they're defined by their classroom or their cell.</p><p begin="00:31:48.27" data-timestamp="1908.27">In the first year of Travis Hill's existence, there were two moments in particular that illustrated how the kids there deal with this bewildering code switch-- inmate to student, student to inmate. The first was this story that kept coming up in almost every interview I did. It was about this kid, Quincy, also 17 years old-- the kind of legendary kid who everyone at a high school still talks about, even though he's no longer there. Ju'ron lived on the same tier of the jail with him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:32:12.04" data-timestamp="1932.04"> Everybody knew Quincy, you know? Quincy, he was just that person. He was just the type of dude, when you come on the tier, he'll try to talk to you, try to jose with you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:32:26.19" data-timestamp="1946.19"> Jose is slang in Louisiana. It sort of means joke, like mess around. Though Quincy didn't really do much school work himself, he'd stand up in class and imitate motivational speakers from YouTube, telling the other kids to do their work. That kind of thing left a big impression on the staff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 1</h4><p begin="00:32:42.08" data-timestamp="1962.08"> He was a calm and cool kid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 2</h4><p begin="00:32:44.17" data-timestamp="1964.17"> He was very, very intelligent. Very intelligent. Very, very intelligent-- just, sorry, I had to stress that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 3</h4><p begin="00:32:51.75" data-timestamp="1971.75"> Well, he just had a charisma about him where he's like, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 1</h4><p begin="00:32:54.15" data-timestamp="1974.15"> He was a leader of the tier.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teacher 2</h4><p begin="00:32:56.65" data-timestamp="1976.65"> If somebody new comes on the unit, somebody wants to go pick on this person or that, Quincy may say, hey, nah, leave that man alone. That man chilling.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:33:05.10" data-timestamp="1985.1"> Quincy wasn't at the jail anymore by the time I visited, so you're not going to hear from him. Part of the reason everyone knew him so well was that he'd been waiting behind bars for two years to get a trial. When he was 15, he was charged as an adult with attempted murder for shooting a gun at state troopers in an unmarked car, along with a group of other teens.</p><p begin="00:33:24.56" data-timestamp="2004.56">Every time he had a court date, he got a ride over to the courthouse in a van. The older kids have to take a school bus, of all vehicles, even though it's only like 500 feet away from the jail. He'd wait in the van in shackles to be called into the courtroom, only to have his case continued again. And then he'd just roll back to school and try to do trigonometry, or whatever.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenneth Dorsey</h4><p begin="00:33:43.71" data-timestamp="2023.71"> Quincy was in a situation with his case that kept getting put off, and put off, and put off, and put off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:33:48.90" data-timestamp="2028.9"> This is Travis Hill's dean of students, Kenneth Dorsey.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenneth Dorsey</h4><p begin="00:33:52.48" data-timestamp="2032.48"> So there's a lot of-- he wasn't interested in doing school. He came, he did a little bit, but then he's off doing something else mentally. And I got to believe it has to do with the fact of what the case was doing to him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:34:09.48" data-timestamp="2049.48"> The day that Quincy finally got to stand in front of a judge was a major event for the entire student body. There had been so much buildup. And in the group claustrophobia of a school in jail, one student's court date feels like everybody's court date. Ju'ron told me and my producer, Sean Cole, what it was like on the juvenile tier beforehand.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:34:27.08" data-timestamp="2067.08"> Everybody, we all got in a circle. We were praying he got good news, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:34:30.56" data-timestamp="2070.56"> You got in a circle and prayed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:34:32.60" data-timestamp="2072.6"> Yeah, we always do that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:34:33.70" data-timestamp="2073.7"> Every time somebody has a big court situation coming up, you do that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:34:38.11" data-timestamp="2078.11"> Yeah, we pray.

So he was like, man, I'm going home tomorrow.</p><p begin="00:34:47.02" data-timestamp="2087.02">It was like, yeah, you going home tomorrow. We were not trying to jinx it. Then he came back, threw his food on the table.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:34:53.13" data-timestamp="2093.13"> Quincy had come back from court and just threw his food on the table.

In the days before Quincy got sent off, even though this goes against the whole point of their school, the teachers decided that he was facing too bleak a future to try to get him to study.

Then we're black. They don't got no white people on our tier.</p><p begin="00:37:34.16" data-timestamp="2254.16">It just looked like we was out for failure. Everybody makes mistakes. That's why I was depressed. I felt like nobody was safe.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:37:41.48" data-timestamp="2261.48"> And you felt like they were basically saying that his life didn't have any worth, because they were just-- he was only 17 years old, and they were giving him 25 years. Is that kind of what it felt like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:37:52.68" data-timestamp="2272.68"> I think so. Yeah, basically.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:37:54.35" data-timestamp="2274.35"> But you're saying that his life did have a lot of worth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:37:59.02" data-timestamp="2279.02"> Yeah, his life had a lot of worth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:38:00.80" data-timestamp="2280.8"> Why does his life and your life have worth?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ju'ron</h4><p begin="00:38:04.89" data-timestamp="2284.89"> Because we're young. We ain't even turned 18 yet. We have still a lot of growing to do. We got changes we can make, you know? Stuff that we can do to change our life, and all that. But once you mess up for once, it's going to cost you the rest of your life. I ain't saying he got life in jail, but 25 years, that's a lot. That's more than a lot.</p><p begin="00:38:31.74" data-timestamp="2311.74">After that, I don't know. That really killed me. When Quincy got sent 25 years, that killed my hopes of getting out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:38:38.98" data-timestamp="2318.98"> A lot of the other kids felt the same way. The math teacher, Ms. Burr, and the other teachers, say that even months later, their students still haven't fully come to terms with Quincy's departure. They still bring him up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Burr</h4><p begin="00:38:50.86" data-timestamp="2330.86"> Literally, I think on Monday, they asked about him, and brought him up, and talked about him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:38:54.45" data-timestamp="2334.45"> And what did they say to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Burr</h4><p begin="00:38:56.27" data-timestamp="2336.27"> What they said was, well, what if I got time like Quincy? What's the point of this education if I'm getting time like him? Then this is a waste of my time. There's no point, because in 25 years-- that's 25 years. I'm not using this.</p><p begin="00:39:12.07" data-timestamp="2352.07">And so then I brought up the way that Quincy left, and how he was like, I know education is important. I want to pursue my education. And they were like, wait, really? He said that? And I was like, yeah, he said that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:39:21.76" data-timestamp="2361.76"> I was at the jail visiting around the time Quincy and another student were sentenced. And I sat in on this one science class where their friends were downright despondent. One was walking around the room, groaning and knocking his head against the door.</p><p begin="00:39:37.25" data-timestamp="2377.25">The teacher was trying to teach a lesson about the properties of living organisms. A living organism needs light, she said, and energy. A living organism needs to live within a community. A living organism responds to stimuli or messages from the environment around it. A living organism has the capacity to grow.</p><p begin="00:40:02.70" data-timestamp="2402.7">When Quincy was shipped upstate, it was probably the lowest moment for the kids. Their most hopeful moment came just a month later. It had to do with another student who nearly everyone at the school talked about and another first at Travis Hill, but of a very different kind.</p><p begin="00:40:15.64" data-timestamp="2415.64">It was the first graduation-- a graduation ceremony for one, one student. A whole ceremony was held for him. The graduate was a kid named Tristion. But people don't call him Tristion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:40:27.11" data-timestamp="2427.11"> I have everybody call me Fireman.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:40:29.24" data-timestamp="2429.24"> OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:40:30.72" data-timestamp="2430.72"> You know, jail give you nicknames. Like, call me Fireman. That's my childhood dream.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:40:34.76" data-timestamp="2434.76"> Oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:40:35.59" data-timestamp="2435.59"> So I think it was in school, you know, we had to sing a song, "Firetrucks are Red," R-E-D. And then I look. I'm liking it. I'm liking what it's looking like.</p><p begin="00:40:46.21" data-timestamp="2446.21">Then every Halloween, from young to a certain age limit, I dressed as a firefighter.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:40:52.79" data-timestamp="2452.79"> You were a fireman every single Halloween?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:40:54.74" data-timestamp="2454.74"> Every single Halloween.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:40:55.69" data-timestamp="2455.69"> That's good. You're consistent.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:40:56.86" data-timestamp="2456.86"> Tristion has the word "fireman" written in Sharpie on the collar of his orange jumpsuit and down its leg. In addition to fighting fires, he wants to start a storm evacuation business. He grew up in the Lower Ninth Ward. And like most of the kids at Travis Hill, he's one of the babies of Hurricane Katrina.</p><p begin="00:41:13.36" data-timestamp="2473.36">Like Ju'ron, he fled to Texas until the water went down. He says his high school class was going to be the first to graduate from a brand new school building that had just been built. But then he came to jail.</p><p begin="00:41:24.39" data-timestamp="2484.39">When Tristion was a juvenile, he coerced underage girls online to send him naked photos. He says he knew it was wrong when he was doing it and that he stopped about a year before he was arrested, at age 18. Tristion is not at all the typical student at Travis Hill. He came to jail before the school existed and was already studying to get his GED, already motivated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:41:44.53" data-timestamp="2504.53"> But then Travis Hill came along. Woo! It was a big game changer. We had classes-- like, real periods. The transitioning, the time up, time to switch and stuff, really gave me that feeling, like I was really in school. I'm like, man, I think I'm going to love this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:42:03.93" data-timestamp="2523.93"> Tristion said school was like having a huge breakfast waiting for him in the morning, with eggs, and grits, and biscuits, and sausage, and orange juice. Meanwhile, his actual breakfast the first morning of school was cereal. It was cereal the next morning, too, and the next.</p><p begin="00:42:20.13" data-timestamp="2540.13">Jail is dispiriting like that, demotivating. And Tristion was bent on staying motivated. So instead of fixating on being in jail, he takes another approach.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:42:28.71" data-timestamp="2548.71"> I try to put that "I'm in a jail facility" to the side.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:42:33.08" data-timestamp="2553.08"> How do you do that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Tristion</h4><p begin="00:42:34.79" data-timestamp="2554.79"> I do it mentally, of course. I look, and I just picture myself in a real class setting. Even though I have to go back to the tier, I don't look at going back to the tier as going home. I look at going back to the tier as, like, you know, just going to this park.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:42:54.66" data-timestamp="2574.66"> A park-- like a city park?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:42:58.39" data-timestamp="2578.39"> Yes, like a city park. You're around a bunch of people you don't really know. You don't know why they're there. But you just know you're surrounded by a bunch of random people.</p><p begin="00:43:10.03" data-timestamp="2590.03">And another thing I programmed in my head, because I want to go to the military also-- I said, by us having all of the same color on, this is boot camp. This is training. This is a training facility.</p><p begin="00:43:23.83" data-timestamp="2603.83">It's not a jail facility. This is a training facility. This is training me to handle being away from family and to be able to better myself. And another way to look at it, if that don't work, I look at it like a hurricane shelter.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:43:36.98" data-timestamp="2616.98"> A hurricane shelter?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:43:38.65" data-timestamp="2618.65"> A hurricane shelter. There's been a bad storm. Everybody's been separated from their people. We're all around, like I said, a bunch of people that you do not know. But you have to survive, and they have the-- they provide the food for you. They come check on you, make sure you follow the rules. Sounds what a hurricane shelter is to me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:44:00.08" data-timestamp="2640.08"> This is the way that Tristion deals with going to school in jail-- by pretending he's not in jail. Some of the other students engage in a similar kind of useful delusion, especially during what one teacher calls the honeymoon phase of jail, when the kids are still telling themselves, and anyone who will listen, that they're getting out tomorrow or next week, against all evidence to the contrary.</p><p begin="00:44:21.39" data-timestamp="2661.39">The school does it, too, by having intentionally condensed units and semesters, with award ceremonies at the end of each one, to at least give the students a feeling of accomplishment or completion.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:44:31.07" data-timestamp="2671.07"> Do you ever get-- do you ever get really down? I mean, it seems like you're very positive. Do you ever get real down?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:44:37.19" data-timestamp="2677.19"> I kid you not, only for one minute. I said, man, this ain't no boot camp. This isn't a hurricane-- this is a real jail. Man. But I say, you know what?</p><p begin="00:44:49.84" data-timestamp="2689.84">And I say this to myself all the time-- I'll be talking to myself and I'll be like, jail is not a bad place. Jail is a place to get you to get right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:45:01.01" data-timestamp="2701.01"> Do you ever think, wait, this isn't actually a school, this is a jail?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:45:06.14" data-timestamp="2706.14"> This is always a school. The only difference is, you have a deputy just standing there, just watching you. And I'm not used to being watched like that. But like I say, the boot camp-- that's my ranking officer. He's making it so I do everything right, make it so I don't mess up, make it so I do this right, just in case I have to go into combat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:45:29.91" data-timestamp="2729.91"> Tristion is obviously a pretty enthusiastic guy in general. But when I asked him about his graduation, he talked for seven minutes straight--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:45:36.75" data-timestamp="2736.75"> Ooh. Man, big day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:45:38.60" data-timestamp="2738.6"> --not just about the event itself, but the moments leading up to it, acting out every part like he was in a one-man show, from getting ready in the morning--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:45:47.43" data-timestamp="2747.43"> Lotion, baby powder, brushing my teeth twice, brushing my hair, smelling good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:45:53.82" data-timestamp="2753.82"> --to the lunch break that day, hours before the ceremony.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:45:57.76" data-timestamp="2757.76"> I eat my food. Let me see, did I eat my food? I did not eat my food, because what we had was not so good. So I just ate the cookies. I sent it back out-- blech, take it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:46:08.58" data-timestamp="2768.58"> And he didn't have to do any fantasizing at all when it came to the ceremony itself. It was the real deal, with balloons, speeches. His family was there. All of his classmates were in attendance. And unlike them, instead of orange, Tristion was decked out in a dark green cap and gown.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:46:24.86" data-timestamp="2784.86"> We tried to figure out, which side does the tassel go on? And here we go.</p><p begin="00:46:29.92" data-timestamp="2789.92">[HUMMING "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"]</p><p begin="00:46:35.47" data-timestamp="2795.47">And just that feeling of everybody looking, smiling. I'm just-- got my little military walk going on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:42.75" data-timestamp="2802.75"> You're saluting?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:46:44.61" data-timestamp="2804.61"> Saluting. I see my grandfather and my mother in the front. And I'm just like, man, this is really big. I get up and do my speech.</p><p begin="00:46:54.33" data-timestamp="2814.33">All right, all right. This selection I selected is about mistakes and consequences, and reads as follows. "While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of these actions. Consequences are governed by natural law. They are out in the circle of--"</p><p begin="00:47:13.02" data-timestamp="2833.02">I glance at my mom. I see the little teardrop right here. She tried to wipe it, but I caught it before she wiped it. I'm like, ah, I seen you. I thought I was going to have-- I thought I was going to cry, which I did later on. My fellow classmates, they were like, man, that's big, son. I want to graduate now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:47:29.24" data-timestamp="2849.24"> Ms. Burr, the math teacher, said she heard the same thing from the students.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Burr</h4><p begin="00:47:33.91" data-timestamp="2853.91"> It was just like, wait, I can actually get a diploma in here. Like, that's a real thing. And so I think sometimes they think we're just saying stuff. And so seeing those moments, they're just like, wow, this actually is a real place.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:47:44.27" data-timestamp="2864.27"> It's almost like they--</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:47:45.74" data-timestamp="2865.74"> It took this kid, who lives in an imaginary version of jail, to make the school inside of the jail feel real. But after Tristion's graduation, he had to go back to his cell, diploma in hand. His family had gone home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tristion</h4><p begin="00:47:58.37" data-timestamp="2878.37"> I went back to the dorm. It came, that one minute. Came that one minute of sadness-- like, the feeling of them leaving, and I'm not able to leave with them or follow right behind them. That really took a little chunk out of me. I'm like-- I'm so used to my mama saying, follow me.</p><p begin="00:48:26.33" data-timestamp="2906.33">And for them to walk out the door, that's the last time I'm seeing them until I get out. And I know I can't walk behind them. That was big. And I'm laying down in my bed. I'm like, here I am, back on the tier, graduated.</p><p begin="00:48:45.20" data-timestamp="2925.2">I say, no, I'm not about to do this. I'm not going to do this. I graduated. I'm going to be home soon.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Eli Hager</h4><p begin="00:48:53.05" data-timestamp="2933.05"> Tristion was sentenced the very next day after his graduation. Last year, he'd asked the court to delay his sentencing until he finished his degree. Now he's at another facility and will be incarcerated until 2021, according to the Louisiana Department of Corrections.</p><p begin="00:49:10.20" data-timestamp="2950.2">One of Travis Hill's staff members, Alexi Gaddis, told the students during a, quote unquote, "life skills" class this spring, that it's already not easy for human beings to dream. It's already a vulnerable thing to believe in yourself, given all the ways the world can crush that. Getting these particular kids to give dreaming another chance, absurd as it can feel in some ways, given what this country thinks of them-- in the end, that's the core curriculum of this school.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:40.98" data-timestamp="2980.98"> Eli Hager-- he's a reporter for the Marshall Project. Since his visit to the Travis Hill school, two more students have graduated in the jail. One of them said seeing Tristion graduate really inspired him.

My picture of it is, like, how glamorous. Are you kidding me? Like, suddenly, their game is elevated. And it's not just a neighborhood game. Now it's like, look, this is just like we're on the radio, which is just like-- that's the same they do for the World Cup.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:26.01" data-timestamp="3146.01"> Daniel's dad would also make up games-- like, whole professional games. Like, all the players, both sides, all the action-- starting, Daniel says, when he was 10 or 11. He would do it just for himself, as a thing to do, though the whole family knew he could do this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Daniel Alarcon</h4><p begin="00:52:42.59" data-timestamp="3162.59"> And if, for example, on a Sunday afternoon, after everyone's had lunch, my father would start to be the entertainment for the adults. Hey, Renato, can you make up a game for us? Make it a good one. And he would just describe a game. And it's a completely made-up game, but when a goal would be scored, inevitably, the adults would cheer. And like, that was great. That was a great game. And he got really good at this.</p><p begin="00:53:11.51" data-timestamp="3191.51">Eventually, he was-- he was-- one of my great uncles had a little theater in a town called Mollendo on the beach-- a beach town in southern Peru.

And I think, at that point, he was like 12 or 13. He goes out on stage, 300 people in the theater. And he's nervous. But what he does is essentially make up a game. So Melgar is the club from Arequipa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:51.09" data-timestamp="3231.09"> They're the local favorite from the province.
