<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.20" data-timestamp="1.2">There's the part of you that's healthy, and there's the part of you that's sick. And sometimes the healthy part doesn't want to admit there's a sick part. Well, back in 1945, Walt Strommer was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge. He was permanently blinded, sent home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walt Strommer</h4><p begin="00:00:15.93" data-timestamp="15.93">For the next year or so, when I was back home going to college, I would dream that I was driving a car. And then in the dream I would think, "You shouldn't be doing this. You're blind."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:26.99" data-timestamp="26.99">In fact, he realized, in his dream, he was always able to see. And even to this day, over 50 years later, he still has these dreams from time to time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walt Strommer</h4><p begin="00:00:35.95" data-timestamp="35.95">Sometimes I will dream of myself as I was as a teenager. And those dreams are almost completely as I would have been then, seeing. Or occasionally, I will still, in dreams, see a page of a book and read it, and absolutely clearly, and I may even remember a sentence or two when I wake up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:02.09" data-timestamp="62.09">Mr. Strommer says it took 10 or 15 years of blindness before he showed up in his own dreams as a blind person. And at some point, he started to wonder, "Why the delay?" He wrote a letter to a publication called <i>Paraplegia</i> <i></i> <i>News</i> asking if anybody else had the same experience. He got a handful of letters from people who had.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walt Strommer</h4><p begin="00:01:21.86" data-timestamp="81.86">Some of them started seeing themselves as in wheelchairs or paralyzed-- whatever-- within a few months. Others it was years before it was incorporated. And I think almost all of them say it's inconsistent. Sometimes they will see themselves as in a wheelchair, the next time not. I think one of the more amusing ones was the man who said he would go along in his wheelchair and he gets to a curb that the chair won't get up on. So he gets out of the chair, lifts it up on the curb, and then he gets back in and goes on his way. Or one woman wrote about she will dream that she's walking with her husband, and he's pushing her wheelchair. And then he sees somebody coming. He says, "Quick, get back in your wheelchair. People are coming."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:29.72" data-timestamp="149.72">Here's a letter that you were sent. An older man writes, "I've been in a wheelchair since October 6, 1966. And during the dream state, I've never visualized myself in a wheelchair. I've been impotent since 1962, but in dreams, I see myself as a stud that can go out with any of the cute, young things."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Walt Strommer</h4><p begin="00:02:46.61" data-timestamp="166.61">Yes. That comes through in a couple of the letters. And as I recall, one of the people wrote-- I guess I had raised the question, why doesn't the dreaming brain catch up and show you the reality? And she said, "Why should it? Why should it be in a hurry to show us the unpleasant side of life? Maybe part of the function of dreams is to give us a few minutes of respite and happiness so we can come out of it and say, 'Hey, that felt pretty good.'"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:24.65" data-timestamp="204.65">One man, a wheelchair user, wrote, "This is better than just a harmless fantasy. It means I can re-experience walking and running temporarily. I wake up mentally refreshed, at ease." Mr. Strommer was a college professor, and he spent some time researching why our subconscious minds would take so long to absorb the new facts about our lives, why his brain took a decade to admit to itself in dreams that he was blind. He says nobody really knows why. It might be chemical, or it might simply be that it's common for us all to see ourselves one way when in reality we're not that way at all.</p><p begin="00:04:07.37" data-timestamp="247.37">Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it is <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, Defying Sickness. Act One, Road Trip. A father and a son go on a long car ride to figure out what parts of the father's brain have not been lost yet to Alzheimer's disease and to try to jump-start his memories. Act Two, My World Record, a hemophiliac's adventures at motocross racing and at setting another world's record. Act Three-- well, just stay tuned for Act Three. We'll launch Act One after some music.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Road Trip</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:17.22" data-timestamp="377.22">Act One, Road Trip. Joel Meyerowitz is a photographer, grew up in New York City. But for the last two decades, his parents have lived in Florida. Joel would see them, visit for a few days at a time. But over the past 10 years, Joel's father, Hy, developed Alzheimer's. Before he retired, Hy was a salesman for 40 years and did a few years as a comic in a vaudeville act before that. He was a boxer, won his weight class in the very first Golden Gloves competition. But now that he had Alzheimer's, the doctor said that he should stay inside, avoid a lot of stimulation. His son Joel thought, "What if we try, just for a brief time, something different?"</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:06:54.72" data-timestamp="414.72">I was visiting my father. We were driving someplace and he was babbling on, as he does. His great skill is that he can talk. And in the middle of one of these riffs, he turned to me with a look of panic, really, and he said, "The trouble with me is I never get to the point where I get to the point." And that was so pungent an observation about his predicament that it entered my consciousness in a way that made me say, now. That's it. I'm going to make a film about him. He's at a place in this disease where, before he's completely gone and while he has some consciousness about his situation, I'm going to take him out into the world again and see what happens to him and how he handles himself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:45.48" data-timestamp="465.48">They got a camera and went on a three-week trip, driving from Ft. Lauderdale back to New York City. Joel Meyerowitz's son Sasha did most of the filming. You hear his voice only a few times in the footage I'm about to play you. When they set out on the trip, Sasha was 27, Joel was 57, Hy was 87.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:08.98" data-timestamp="488.98">Do you know what ocean this is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:12.32" data-timestamp="492.32">Well, I'll be honest with you, Joel. I don't remember. Not the Catskills Ocean--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:18.64" data-timestamp="498.64">The Catskills are mountains. This is an ocean. Which one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:23.42" data-timestamp="503.42">Well, I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:25.70" data-timestamp="505.7">Is it the Pacific or the Atlantic?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:27.84" data-timestamp="507.84">I will take that as Pacific.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:29.74" data-timestamp="509.74">Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:30.22" data-timestamp="510.22">Wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:31.17" data-timestamp="511.17">Wrong?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:34.42" data-timestamp="514.42">Yeah, wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:35.27" data-timestamp="515.27">So which one is it then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:36.89" data-timestamp="516.89">It's the permiss- permission of--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:38.92" data-timestamp="518.92">The Permishic. Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:39.85" data-timestamp="519.85">The Permishic!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:40.58" data-timestamp="520.58">The Farshimmelt. The Farshimmelt Ocean.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:42.29" data-timestamp="522.29">I am a bissel farshimmelt! What are you asking me so early in the morning a question like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:55.68" data-timestamp="535.68">Where were you born?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:08:56.92" data-timestamp="536.92">1-0-9-2-- 1-0-9-2-0-7-- no. 1-5-9-0-5-9 East--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:09:12.07" data-timestamp="552.07">Well, it was East 100th Street, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:09:13.83" data-timestamp="553.83">Yeah. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Joel Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:09:26.29" data-timestamp="566.29">He taught me all the street-smart things. He set up a punching bag for me. And he taught me how to fight, how to take my stance, how to throw a punch, how to put your body behind it. He had me work out on a light bag too, like this. He always felt that if you got into a scrape in the neighborhood that you shouldn't run away. His motto was, "Step in and deliver the first blow." And he said, "Take the biggest guy down."</p><p begin="00:10:01.66" data-timestamp="601.66">And that was his attitude. He wouldn't stop and run away from anything. On Morrison Avenue, the block we lived on, he was considered the mayor of the block. Anytime there was a dispute that had to be settled, they would actually come and ask him, "What do you think, Hy?" Or if there were strangers coming through the neighborhood and they needed to be told to get out of there, they'd get him. And the scenes I remember of it, people would gather in front of our window, and they'd yell, "Hymie? Hey, Hymie?" And he'd come to the window and he would adjudicate from the window. He would say, "No, no. You shouldn't do that. And he should do this. And you get that. Let him alone." And it was like <i>The</i> <i>Judge.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hy Meyerowitz</h4><p begin="00:10:47.75" data-timestamp="647.75">Here we come, baby.

John buried his head in his hands.</p><p begin="00:44:48.36" data-timestamp="2688.36">"I'm going to feed him," my mother said.</p><p begin="00:44:51.17" data-timestamp="2691.17">"No way," I said. For a second I forgot to clap, then caught myself and reestablished my rhythm.</p><p begin="00:45:01.39" data-timestamp="2701.39">"We'll have a large mushroom and pepperoni," my mother said, "and I'd like a glass of iced tea. What do you want to drink?"</p><p begin="00:45:08.77" data-timestamp="2708.77">"I want a Coke," John said.</p><p begin="00:45:11.65" data-timestamp="2711.65">"Root beer," I said.</p><p begin="00:45:14.11" data-timestamp="2714.11">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:45:22.10" data-timestamp="2722.1">There are times in the last minutes before I am allowed-- or allow myself-- more codeine when the pain inside the joint simplifies me utterly. I feel myself descending some kind of evolutionary ladder until I become as crude and guileless as an amoeba. The pain is not personal. I am incidental to it. It is like faith, the believer eclipsed by something immense.</p><p begin="00:45:52.83" data-timestamp="2752.83">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:45:59.12" data-timestamp="2759.12">After the waitress left, my mother lectured me about not participating in events we scheduled on John's off days, days when he wasn't on the dialysis machine. "You've known for a week that we were coming here. You could have picked another day for this clapping business." She said this in front of John, who grimaced and began looking around the room.</p><p begin="00:46:20.68" data-timestamp="2780.68">My argument was that just being there at Pizza Hut while I was in the crucial early hours of breaking a world record was sufficient participation, and that sipping a little root beer under the circumstances put me solidly in the off-day spirit of things. She didn't see it that way.</p><p begin="00:46:41.57" data-timestamp="2801.57">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:46:46.76" data-timestamp="2806.76">What surprised me was how easy it was to keep a precise and consistent rhythm. Two hours into the record, I felt as if my hands, like the legs of runners who have broken through the wall, could hammer away at themselves effortlessly and indefinitely. At that point, I knew I would not start a bleed. I had no doubt. And yet my hands kept hammering at themselves, hammering.</p><p begin="00:47:14.68" data-timestamp="2834.68">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:47:20.79" data-timestamp="2840.79">"Nixon's problem is he's not eating right," my mother said. "It's as plain as day. Anyone can see it. Just look at the man." It was 5:30 PM and I was still at it, 120 claps per minute.</p><p begin="00:47:36.19" data-timestamp="2856.19">"Care for a drink?" my father said to himself. "Don't mind if I do. Thank you for asking."</p><p begin="00:47:41.62" data-timestamp="2861.62">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:47:49.70" data-timestamp="2869.7">For a long time, I asked John to come and watch me race. Again and again, he refused. Finally, he agreed to come to a race at Hidden Hills Raceway in Gallipolis, Ohio-- to shut me up, I think, as much as to satisfy his curiosity about his hemophiliac brother racing a motorcycle across the gouged wilderness. I knew John would have to wear a plastic bag over his shunt arm to keep the dust out. We were lucky it rained. Dust usually billowed wildly after the start of a race, a huge rolling wave breaking over the hills and shrouding the spectators. Rain would keep the dirt moist and on the track.</p><p begin="00:48:36.77" data-timestamp="2916.77">Midway through the practice sessions, however, the rain stopped. By the time of the first 125 moto, dust forced John into the cab of the pickup. That is the image that attacks me now-- John in the truck, windows rolled up, reading a book to pass the time while I kicked up the dust all around him.</p><p begin="00:49:05.33" data-timestamp="2945.33">Random symmetries. Days when John's shunt clotted and he required I forget how many cc's of heparin to get his blood to stop coagulating. Meanwhile, I'd start a bleed and would need cryoprecipitate or factor VIII to get my blood to clot.</p><p begin="00:49:34.28" data-timestamp="2974.28">More x-rays. I've stopped bleeding into the spinal muscles. Soon enough, my hematologist says my body will loosen and break down and absorb the hardened blood surrounding the spine, as it had been doing in my leg. There has been no intraspinal bleeding, no bleeding into the kidney or liver. I look at Carrie. I look at my mother and father. We are inside a sudden, astonishing calm. I seem to levitate and hover over the white sheets.</p><p begin="00:50:11.91" data-timestamp="3011.91">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:50:15.74" data-timestamp="3015.74">Once when John was dialyzing, I tripped into the machine and jerked a tube clean out of its socket. John's blood pumped and sprayed into the air, splattering across the carpet and splotching our skin and clothes. My mother worked frantically to reconnect the tube and to stabilize John's blood pressure. Later, I noticed that some of the blood had seeped inside a picture frame in the wall besides the dialysis chair. The frame held a photograph of John and me. We were wading in the Kanawha River, staring hard at the gray water.</p><p begin="00:50:55.56" data-timestamp="3055.56">[CLAPPING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:14.46" data-timestamp="3074.46">Excerpts from Tom Andrews' prose poem "Codeine Diary."

<h3>Act Three: Iron Man</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:56.99" data-timestamp="3116.99">Act Three, Iron Man. All of our stories today have been at one level about yearning briefly fulfilled. And we thought this last story would be a perfect way to end this show. Mark O'Brien is a writer living in California, but because of a childhood case of polio, he lives most of each day in an iron lung, on his back. He's the subject of the documentary film <i>Breathing</i> <i>Lessons</i> by Jessica Yu. The film is remarkable because it's about a guy in an iron long, but it is completely unsentimental. There are even parts where it's funny.</p><p begin="00:52:25.73" data-timestamp="3145.73">This is a brief scene from the film. Because he's in the iron lung, Mark O'Brien has attendants. They cook and they help him out during the day. And during the film, he explains that nowadays he always has men do this job. Because back when he had women do the job, he kept falling in love with these women, and the love was never reciprocated. He wrote about one of these women, "Her pale, perfect skin, her strong, fleshy legs drove me to ecstasies of despair. See, she talked to me as a human instead of her savagely crippled employer."</p><p begin="00:52:55.64" data-timestamp="3175.64">A quick warning before I play this very brief scene. It contains mild sexual content that may not be suitable for every listener.</p><p begin="00:53:04.15" data-timestamp="3184.15">[IRON LUNG RESPIRATION]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark O'brien</h4><p begin="00:53:13.44" data-timestamp="3193.44">I hired a sex-surrogate in-- '87 or '86. I forget when. I just-- felt very crazy. I was-- angry at all women for not falling in love-- with me, because I had fallen in love with several-- attendants. And they-- all said it was a business rela-- tionship.</p><p begin="00:53:40.78" data-timestamp="3220.78">A sex surrogate's a person who has some of psychological training that-- works with their body, having sex with a client who's recruited by a therapist. The surrogate had this big mirror and she-- saw me naked and aroused. And-- at the time, I thought I was the ugliest man in the world. I looked just like something someone-- wouldn't want to have sex with.</p><p begin="00:54:10.33" data-timestamp="3250.33">And Cheryl was very kind to me. She kissed me on the chest after-- we had intercourse. I felt my-- chest was very unattractive, but-- she kissed me right there. And-- the intercourse was so quick, it just-- I hate to say it, but it was wham, bam, thank you ma'am. And it-- wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but-- being naked in a bed with a woman who's being extremely friendly was the-- most fun I've ever had. I think I'd like to do it again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:09.12" data-timestamp="3309.12">Usually Mark O'Brien can't be outside of his iron lung for more than 45 minutes. But when the sex surrogate was with him, he was outside his tube for longer than that, longer than he almost every goes out. And he didn't even use his portable respirator.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark O'brien</h4><p begin="00:55:23.08" data-timestamp="3323.08">I didn't need it for an hour. I went for-- an hour without it. It makes you think of sex as respiratory-- therapy. Maybe Medi-Cal would pay for it. About a year after I last saw her, I just felt terribly depressed. I expected somehow that seeing the surrogate would change my life. I had started wearing cologne. And I thought everyone would be able to tell if I was sexy and handsome.</p><p begin="00:55:54.92" data-timestamp="3354.92">Nothing happened. They tell us to think of ourselves as-- sexual and beautiful, but it doesn't do any good-- unless someone else sees us as sexual and beautiful. You just can't demand love. You-- have to be lovable, and-- I'm still trying to figure out how to do that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:24.18" data-timestamp="3384.18">Mark O'Brien in Jessica Yu's film, <i>Breathing</i> <i>Lessons.</i> O'Brien has a new book of poems called <i>The</i> <i>Man</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>Iron</i> <i>Lung</i> published by the Lemonade Factory in Berkeley.</p></div> </div>
