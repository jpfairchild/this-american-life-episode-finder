<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.41" data-timestamp="0.41">Alex spoke Russian, lived in Russia for a year, worked with Russian refugees in Chicago for two years. And his Russian teacher thought that he only needed one thing to make his life complete.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:00:09.70" data-timestamp="9.7">She thought I needed a Russian girlfriend. She thought that only Russians would be able to stand up to me the way that I needed to be stood up to, or something. I don't know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:17.12" data-timestamp="17.12">Our American women are just too soft.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:00:19.97" data-timestamp="19.97">I don't know what you-- I truly don't know. But anyway, that's the thought she had.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:24.05" data-timestamp="24.05">So she kept trying to fix him up with Russian women. And this one night, she had him come out with a whole bunch of people, including this woman Elena, who was going to be his date.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:00:32.75" data-timestamp="32.75">And so I meet them for dinner. And we're at the sushi restaurant, and we're all eating, and everybody's telling stories, funny stories. And I'm sitting across from my date. And my Russian teacher is turning to me and saying, you know, tell them this story! Tell them that story! And so then I tell them this story and that story, and everybody's laughing, except for my date.</p><p begin="00:00:50.18" data-timestamp="50.18">And so we leave the sushi restaurant and we go to this club. And we're all dancing. Like, my Russian teacher's dancing, and all of her friends are dancing, and everybody's sort of like, you know, exchanging partners, and it's sort of this fun scene. And everybody's dancing except for my date, who's just sitting at the table and sort of nursing a drink.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:09.11" data-timestamp="69.11">And looking--?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:01:10.03" data-timestamp="70.03">And looking bored. Really bored.</p><p begin="00:01:13.77" data-timestamp="73.77">And so, you know, I keep on coming back from the dance floor, and saying, are you sure you don't want to dance? You want to dance? And then she will sort of smile bitterly, and just shake her head, and-- and so then somebody else will drag me out.</p><p begin="00:01:28.14" data-timestamp="88.14">So finally I come back and I sit down, and I'm sitting next to her, and I'm trying to strike up a conversation. And you know, something about like, I guess you don't like dancing, or something like that. And she sort of looks out at the floor, and there's people having a great time all around. And she sort of like nods her chin towards the floor and she's like, "This is an American dance number."</p><p begin="00:01:57.50" data-timestamp="117.5">And I drove away thinking, well, that was a horrible date. Like, neither of us enjoyed each other. And that was a disaster, pretty much. Like, we were not going to be seeing each other again.</p><p begin="00:02:08.30" data-timestamp="128.3">I get to Russian class the next week, and my Russian teacher says, "hey, so are you going to call Elena? She said she had a great time." And I was like, I was floored by that. I was trying to figure out what that could possibly have meant, right?</p><p begin="00:02:28.67" data-timestamp="148.67">And so I was like sort of mulling it over in my head, because it was really fascinating to me. And I realized that I have a very sort of like clear and perhaps culturally informed idea of what a great date is. And it has to do with the idea of, like, what it means to fall in love. And I realized that in my head, what I think about as a great date is what sort of you see in the movies. Like sort of the "falling in love" montage of the movies.</p><p begin="00:02:58.15" data-timestamp="178.15">You know, you go on a great date. It often involves a boardwalk. There's a great deal of sort of like, throwing your heads back in laughter. You might chase each other around a tree.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:10.99" data-timestamp="190.99">There's the splashing of water.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:03:12.55" data-timestamp="192.55">Splashing of water is almost always involved.</p><p begin="00:03:18.67" data-timestamp="198.67">And I think for her, and this is something that I always noticed when I was in Russia, I think that for her, it's totally different thing. In Russia, and in Russian literature, there's a lot of talk about the soul and soulmates. And I think for her, like, falling in love means finding the one person on the planet who understands the misery of life as deeply and fully as you do. And they can talk to you about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:56.06" data-timestamp="236.06">And so when she acted all depressed on their date, she was not actually blowing Alex off like he thought at the time. She was flirting.</p><p begin="00:04:05.83" data-timestamp="245.83">So Alex decides to ask his Russian teacher about this theory, that Americans and Russians have completely different views of what it means to fall in love. And I have to say, he's a little bit nervous to try this out on her, because he's worried that maybe it's insulting or stereotyping Russians. But he explains the theory to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:04:21.22" data-timestamp="261.22">And she totally agreed. She was like, that's absolutely right. You're right. And and then she just went on a rant about Americans. And she was like, Americans, they have no understanding of what it's like to fall in love. And like, Americans, I never understand, why do you say, "he makes me laugh?" Why is that so important? "He makes me laugh?" Every American I've ever met, all they say, when you ask them how the relationship is, and they say "he makes me laugh" as if that's the greatest thing in the world? What's so great about "he makes me laugh?"</p><p begin="00:04:50.00" data-timestamp="290">She just, you know, went off on like, something that I have actually said many times. Like, I just want somebody who makes me laugh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:07.79" data-timestamp="307.79">Some days seems like every story in the world is the story of cultural misunderstanding. Between people of different countries, Muslims and Christians, blacks and whites, Republicans and Democrats, men and women, Spanish speakers and Anglos, adults and children, rich people and poor people. And so today, in this era of misunderstandings abroad and at home, we bring you an hour of stories about what gets lost in translation.</p><p begin="00:05:31.20" data-timestamp="331.2">From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Our program today in three culture-bridging acts.</p><p begin="00:05:39.73" data-timestamp="339.73">Act One, The Chasm Between Comedy and Music. In that act, two brave people step into that chasm. Drop into that chasm. However you put it.</p><p begin="00:05:51.21" data-timestamp="351.21">Act Two, Star of Bethlehem. We bring you the story of the most important, most respected newsman on television in the town of Bethlehem, who does a program that is unlike any news show that you have ever seen.</p><p begin="00:06:04.44" data-timestamp="364.44">Act Three. Translating For the Very, Very, Very, Very, Very Tall. In which we have, for a change, on our program a story that gets us close to someone so famous that you may have actually heard of him if you follow pro basketball in the tiniest way. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: The Chasm Between Comedy And Music</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:24.38" data-timestamp="384.38"> Act One. The Chasm Between Comedy and Music.</p><p begin="00:06:27.93" data-timestamp="387.93">Well, we start today's program about translation with a story about karaoke. In karaoke, after all, you are the interpreter. You are the translator. You stand there with the words of the song appearing on a little TV monitor and you try to render a life-size performance-- a translation of the original hit, if you will-- rendered in the musical language of you.</p><p begin="00:06:48.30" data-timestamp="408.3">And in a way, it's surprising that the only karaoke we have is for music. Why not karaoke of the "I Have a Dream" speech, or the "You talking to me?" from <i>Taxi</i> <i>Driver.</i> Recently Jonathan Goldstein and Starlee Kine, you hear them both on our program from time to time, heard about a karaoke bar which not only had songs, but comedy routines that you could perform onstage. They decided to find out for themselves how stand up comedy translates to the karaoke stage.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:07:16.15" data-timestamp="436.15">Starlee and I talk quite a bit about chops. Comedic chops. Pacing, placement of the zinger. When to employ whimsy and when to employ wit. Chops.</p><p begin="00:07:26.31" data-timestamp="446.31">Back when we worked in adjoining cubicles, we'd kill time by arguing over what was funny and what wasn't. Blowing cigar smoke in a baby's face? Not funny. A baby smoking a cigar? Funny.</p><p begin="00:07:39.72" data-timestamp="459.72">We were like Borscht Belt comedians without the borscht, the belt, or the audience. But the fact that we weren't knocking them dead at Grossinger's every night didn't keep us from coming up with titles for our showbiz bios. Starlee's book was going to be called <i>The</i> <i>Woman</i> <i>Behind</i> <i>the</i> <i>Chops,</i> while I intended to call mine <i>Sir</i> <i>Chops-a-Lot.</i></p><p begin="00:08:03.48" data-timestamp="483.48">Why, just the other day, I was giving young Starlee a quiz. What's the most important thing in comedy? I asked her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:08:10.29" data-timestamp="490.29">I have to say--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:08:11.57" data-timestamp="491.57">Timing.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:12.93" data-timestamp="492.93">Chops.</p><p begin="00:08:23.52" data-timestamp="503.52">So finally, Starlee and I, after years of talking about comedy, actually decided to go out and create comedy. We were going to take it to the stage and tell jokes for an audience at this karaoke bar. We were going to exchange the tweed vestments of the armchair humorologist for the rainbow-striped suspenders of the practitioner. We wanted to see if we had what it took.</p><p begin="00:08:48.33" data-timestamp="528.33">The karaoke bar is called The Hidden Cove, and it had catalogs of different comedy routines, all from the late '80s, early '90s. Starlee had already looked through them. She decided she was going to do a man-bashing routine called "Men are Perfect-- Jerks."

At the office where Starlee and I used to work together, people whose names she didn't even know would seek her out, bringing her homemade bread, presenting her with souvenirs from their vacations, and even setting aside her favorite caramel taffies from the communal office candy dish. I, on the other hand, had made the effort to learn the names of their children, grandchildren, and in one case, their pet hamster, Mr. Jinglepot. For all of this, I got nothing.</p><p begin="00:09:58.81" data-timestamp="598.81">Starlee had concerns about the caliber of the jokes on the karaoke machine at the bar, how stale they might be. I explained to her that the material, no matter how cliched or boorish, did not matter. A true humorist, I said, could stand on stage and get laughs while reading an eviction notice. It was all in the delivery. It was all about chops.</p><p begin="00:10:24.52" data-timestamp="624.52">When we showed up, we learned that The Hidden Cove is a very popular and beloved karaoke bar and it was filled with patrons who came there every week to sing. This was the first week of the Iraq war, and the regulars, just like everyone else, had wanted some diversion, a night away from the news. They took their karaoke very seriously, too. One man was hunched over a tattered notebook that he brought from home in which he had neatly penciled the code numbers of his favorite karaoke songs, row after row of them.</p><p begin="00:10:51.83" data-timestamp="651.83">As people got on the stage to sing and dance, there was a general feeling of warmth and beery encouragement in the air. Everyone seemed to know everyone else. And when we asked them about the comedy routines on the karaoke machine, no one could recall ever having seen them done. Even the owners of the bar weren't quite sure what we were talking about.</p><p begin="00:11:09.56" data-timestamp="669.56">We finally found a lone page of comedy karaoke material and we signed up to go on.

It just keeps scrolling down at the same pace. This means that sometimes you have to wait for a punchline to a joke for several awkward moments after having delivered the setup. It was messing up my chops.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:12:12.08" data-timestamp="732.08">When I got lost, a cop helped me to look for my parents.

It was like they just didn't know what else to do. Perhaps they were booing the sheer extraordinary coincidence at all.

<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:59.64" data-timestamp="1139.64"> Act Two. Star of Bethlehem.</p><p begin="00:19:02.50" data-timestamp="1142.5">OK, now these possibly helpful geopolitical facts. Most Palestinians don't speak Hebrew. Most Israelis don't speak Arabic. Where Palestinians live, in a place like Bethlehem on the West Bank, Israeli newspapers aren't even for sale. Checkpoints block the passage of civilians from one side to another. All of this to say, each side has very little daily knowledge what the other side is thinking and talking about.</p><p begin="00:19:25.72" data-timestamp="1165.72">But for the last three and a half years, since the beginning of the current intifada, a Palestinian journalist in Bethlehem had a nightly news program on Bethlehem TV where he translates the Israeli nightly news broadcasts into Arabic, live, in real time. He also translates and summarizes articles from the Israeli newspapers and internet sites. The show is popular in Bethlehem, but it is very complicated speaking your enemy's language. Nancy Updike tells the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:19:52.01" data-timestamp="1192.01">Because he's translating, Nasser Laham is reporting things that have never been reported in the territories before. Things that in the normal course of events are not even talked about in public.</p><p begin="00:20:02.26" data-timestamp="1202.26">When Yasser Arafat slapped the former head of security for the West Bank, stuck a gun in his face, and said, "I'm going to kill you," Nasser's translation of an Israeli TV report was the only Arabic language broadcast to mention the incident. When an Israeli newspaper published an expose about corruption in the top leadership in Bethlehem, Nasser was the only one who picked the story up, and he broadcast his translation in spite of a flurry of increasingly threatening phone calls from the leaders involved. Soon after, they were all ousted.</p><p begin="00:20:31.42" data-timestamp="1231.42">And even though the story came from a newspaper in Jerusalem, which is only 15 minutes away from Bethlehem, most likely, no one would have heard about it if Nasser hadn't told the story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasser Laham</h4><p begin="00:20:41.27" data-timestamp="1241.27">There is no comparing between the Palestinian newspapers and the Israeli newspapers. Because our newspapers are, I mean, very bad. It's hard. It's hard to take the truth from your enemies, on the Israeli side. Not from the Palestinian leadership.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:21:01.00" data-timestamp="1261">All Palestinian media-- newspapers, radio, television, except for private television stations like Bethlehem TV-- are tightly controlled by the Palestinian Authority.

But they didn't understand what they are talking in the television with the Hebrew. This is my work. To translate emotions, facts, numbers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:23:41.89" data-timestamp="1421.89">In fact, plenty of the details Nasser translates have got to stir outrage rather than sympathy. Nasser's producer told me that one of the reasons Bethlehem TV decided it was important to follow Israel's continuous coverage after a suicide attack is that Israelis speak then without filters. Politicians openly called for what's known as "transfer"-- the removal of all Palestinians from the territories. Ordinary Israelis call for revenge, say the peace process is hopeless because Palestinians are all terrorists.</p><p begin="00:24:11.71" data-timestamp="1451.71">Nasser translates it all without hedging. Palestinians never use the words "terrorist" or "suicide bomber." They say "shahid"-- "martyr." But when Israel TV says terrorist, Nasser does too.</p><p begin="00:24:33.16" data-timestamp="1473.16">I'd wanted to meet Nasser ever since I saw this book he published about Arafat, which is so strange and provocative that it's not in any Palestinian political category so much as orbiting all of them. The cover of the book is red with a picture of Arafat smiling, and the title is <i>The</i> <i>Truth,</i> <i>the</i> <i>Whole</i> <i>Truth</i> <i>About</i> <i>Yasir</i> <i>Arafat,</i> <i>The</i> <i>Man</i> <i>Who's</i> <i>Led</i> <i>Fatah</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>PLO</i> <i>for</i> <i>37</i> <i>Years.</i> On the back it says, "In this book, I put between the hands of the reader what has never been said before about the man who led one of the greatest and longest liberation movements in the world. With all modesty, I present the reader with information in opposition to what Palestinian, Arabic, Islamic, Western, and Israeli research and study have determined about this man.</p><p begin="00:25:17.22" data-timestamp="1517.22">When you open the book, it's empty. All the pages are blank, except the very first page, where Nasser invites the readers to fill the book with their own opinions. "I'm confident that you'll have something to write," he says "because every person views President Arafat as he wishes."</p><p begin="00:25:34.00" data-timestamp="1534">Half the Palestinians I show the book to get really angry. The other half burst out laughing, at least in part due to shock. You just don't see this kind of joke-- an absurdist prank-- in the Territories, where the situation is so dire, where everyone feels like the entire world is against them and their leader.</p><p begin="00:25:52.97" data-timestamp="1552.97">In general, Nasser's sense of humor is pretty dark. One time, he was telling me how much the Arab world hates Israel's Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon He offered this prescription for fighting al-Qaeda and achieving world peace.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nasser Laham</h4><p begin="00:26:05.91" data-timestamp="1565.91">If Sharon supported al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, maybe all the Middle East will be against al-Qaeda. It's a good idea. Try that.</p><p begin="00:26:25.01" data-timestamp="1585.01">Nasser drives to work in the morning in his beat up '84 Opel hatchback, a car so crappy it's like a giant neon sign saying, I am not on the take. He turns on the TV and Israeli army radio and starts looking at the breaking news in Israel over the internet.</p><p begin="00:26:40.22" data-timestamp="1600.22">He lights a cigarette. He smokes all the time and in this way that makes you feel like everyone else who smokes is just messing around. With every drag, he takes all the smoke in in a big gulp. He smokes each one down into the filter is about to melt. I've never seen him eat.</p><p begin="00:26:58.58" data-timestamp="1618.58">Nasser taught himself Hebrew in prison from an Arabic Hebrew dictionary he asked his parents to send him. I should mention that so many Palestinian men have been to prison that it's almost a given, especially men around Nasser's age, 36, who were young activists at university during the first intifada.</p><p begin="00:27:15.99" data-timestamp="1635.99">As soon as he learned Hebrew, he started teaching other prisoners. He's taught it ever since-- to friends, relatives, students, businessmen. It's sort of a compulsion.</p><p begin="00:27:26.46" data-timestamp="1646.46">His crusade to teach and translate Hebrew raises a question. What good is it, in a violent conflict that's been going on for decades, to speak your enemy's language? What can it change?</p><p begin="00:27:37.72" data-timestamp="1657.72">Nasser reads and enjoys Israeli novels. He listens to Israeli pop, has Israeli friends, mostly journalists. He's an idealist. He believes that learning the language of the other side can be the first step toward understanding them, toward peace.</p><p begin="00:27:52.49" data-timestamp="1672.49">A 28 year old named Mohammed with a big, sad face, a guy Nasser taught Hebrew to, tells me this story about being in an Israeli hospital, in a room full of Israeli kids, when he was 16. Mohammed asked the kid in the bed next to him, in Hebrew, "So what are you in for?" "Car accident," the kid said. "And you?" Mohammed said, "I was shot in the leg by an Israeli soldier."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mohammed</h4><p begin="00:28:16.15" data-timestamp="1696.15">They asked me, why they shot you?

Most businesses are dead or on the ropes. No parks, no pools. In the summer, people often have running water only once a week, or even every two weeks. Israeli army vehicles roll through practically every day, sometimes to demolish a house, and the neighbors pull chairs onto their roofs and sit watching the destruction, since most don't have jobs.

And that's a situation you never see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:48:09.94" data-timestamp="2889.94">Yeah. We're going to go to Burger King right now. Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:48:13.11" data-timestamp="2893.11">Where's his dad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:48:15.49" data-timestamp="2895.49">I don't know. Here, talk to Yao Ming. I'm going crazy here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:48:19.60" data-timestamp="2899.6">Here's what most of my cousin's glamorous job looks like up close. Usually he and Yao are nowhere near a basketball court. Usually he's not even translating. Right here, Colin is trying to get Yao to the DMV so he can take his driver's test. It's part of Colin's job to be Yao's driving instructor.</p><p begin="00:48:36.37" data-timestamp="2916.37">The problem today is, a <i>National</i> <i>Geographic</i> film crew wants to tag along. Colin can't find Yao's dad, who's also taking the test, and Yao is hungry. Colin literally can't go 10 minutes without having his cell phone ring, and it's never for him. Yao's agents, people from the Rockets, from the press, from the companies Yao endorses, even Yao's parents-- they all get to him through Colin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:48:59.91" data-timestamp="2939.91">Hey Angie, it's Colin. I just wanted to find, when is a good time? When am I going to be able to give you this stuff? After the game, or? Like, the tea, and I have something I need to give you, and I think I have a check from Yao Ming or his mother--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:49:15.22" data-timestamp="2955.22">Here's something else. Colin lives with Yao in a huge house, in a gated community, in a Houston suburb, together with Yao's mother and father, who keep a tight leash on their 22 year old son. Originally, Colin was supposed have his own place, but the Yaos invited him into the house early in the season. He thought about it and decided it made sense, since he'd be spending almost every minute with Yao anyway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:49:38.98" data-timestamp="2978.98">It also felt like, you know, they were being very nice in offering, and I thought I didn't want to offend them by turning them down. But it made sense. It just made a lot of sense.</p><p begin="00:49:49.93" data-timestamp="2989.93">But I mean, I'm 29, and I'm not accustomed to living with a family. Sometimes I think that his mom looks at me as a little kid. I know she worries if I don't eat enough, or you know. And it's really sweet. It's nice. But it's a little strange.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:50:11.30" data-timestamp="3011.3">It'd be strange to move back in with your own family at 29, let alone a Chinese family you just met, which doesn't speak English, and whose shortest member, Yao's mom, is a half foot taller than you.</p><p begin="00:50:23.20" data-timestamp="3023.2">Colin doesn't like talking about his home life with the Yaos. That's private. So private that he never has anyone over to visit, friends or family. He can't even invite me in for a beer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:50:36.79" data-timestamp="3036.79">No, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:50:41.79" data-timestamp="3041.79">Two days after Yao passes his driving test, I tag along with him and Colin as they head home from practice. They sing along to the radio together. They finish each other's sentences and tease each other in a mixture of English and Chinese.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yao Ming</h4><p begin="00:50:56.25" data-timestamp="3056.25">You know, before I met him, I think Colin is maybe 40 years old people. When I saw them, I think, oh, my God. It's a young boy. Maybe younger than me. But I ask him, he say 28. I said, 28? He looks very young!</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:51:16.57" data-timestamp="3076.57">Does Colin have any annoying traits? Does he not clean up his room anything? Does he hog the Nintendo?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:51:22.73" data-timestamp="3082.73">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yao Ming</h4><p begin="00:51:28.49" data-timestamp="3088.49">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:51:32.38" data-timestamp="3092.38">He can't beat me, so I'm the one who's always hogging it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:51:36.52" data-timestamp="3096.52">Their bond has been formed through an intense mutual experience. The world of the NBA is foreign to both of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:51:42.59" data-timestamp="3102.59">There were lots of times, especially on the road, you know, we'd have dinner in a hotel room, and we'd talk. And we'd say-- I would get stressed out over a press conference or something, and I'd tell him, you know, this is why I'm stressed. And he'd do his best to help me after that.</p><p begin="00:52:01.40" data-timestamp="3121.4">And it was harder for me to help him, because you know, the pressure on him was so much greater. I mean, for instance, was it the second Laker game in LA? We lost in overtime, and he fouled out. And he was really upset. And I did my-- I said, if you hadn't-- he had a great game, though. And I said, if you hadn't played well, we probably wouldn't have gotten here. Gone into overtime.</p><p begin="00:52:32.89" data-timestamp="3152.89">The only thing I can do is just be an ear. Be somebody, you know, who says, I understand. And then mean it. Because I got to see it firsthand.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:52:51.19" data-timestamp="3171.19">Three fourths of the way through the basketball season, I catch a Rockets game at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It's a packed house, despite the fact the New York team, the Knicks, suck.</p><p begin="00:53:02.05" data-timestamp="3182.05">Almost a third of the crowd is Chinese, many of them attending their first NBA game. They're here because of Yao, who's now a full-fledged phenomenon. He's only been in the US for four months, but he's already the new face of Apple Computer, Gatorade, and Visa.</p><p begin="00:53:16.87" data-timestamp="3196.87">To the surprise of the normal Knicks crowd, Yao's army comes ready to scream, and many have made homemade signs proclaiming their love of Yao.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 3</h4><p begin="00:53:24.56" data-timestamp="3204.56">What's your sign say here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan</h4><p begin="00:53:26.40" data-timestamp="3206.4">Yao Ming, The Next Big Thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 3</h4><p begin="00:53:28.95" data-timestamp="3208.95">What's so exciting about him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan</h4><p begin="00:53:30.78" data-timestamp="3210.78">Honestly, I feel very proud. I plan on opening a basketball camp in Pakistan in the future because of this.

Pakistan. This is the power of Yao Ming. He's united the Asian mainland with the Indian subcontinent.</p><p begin="00:53:48.58" data-timestamp="3228.58">Just to see how far his celebrity extends, I ask this 22 year old fan about my cousin.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:53:53.88" data-timestamp="3233.88">He's got a translator. What do you think of that job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 2</h4><p begin="00:53:56.16" data-timestamp="3236.16">Well, I actually have a sign for him right there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:53:59.20" data-timestamp="3239.2">What does it say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 2</h4><p begin="00:53:59.82" data-timestamp="3239.82">Right here. "Move over Batman and Robin. We have some new heroes in town, Yao Ming and Colin Pine. Citizens of Houston have no fear. Ming and Pine are here."</p><p begin="00:54:10.07" data-timestamp="3250.07">I'm just a huge fan. Colin Pine-- he's Yao's right hand man right now. I mean, he's the one that's doing all the talking for Yao in English. So we get Yao's word through him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:54:21.23" data-timestamp="3261.23">Is he a celebrity?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 2</h4><p begin="00:54:22.50" data-timestamp="3262.5">Oh, definitely. When you're anyone around Yao, it's a celebrity. I'll tell you that much.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:54:27.11" data-timestamp="3267.11">I'm floored by this. And my question of the night becomes, who's Colin Pine?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:54:31.42" data-timestamp="3271.42">You guys know who Colin Pine is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 3</h4><p begin="00:54:33.34" data-timestamp="3273.34">The interpreter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 4</h4><p begin="00:54:34.96" data-timestamp="3274.96">Yao Ming's translator.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 5</h4><p begin="00:54:36.67" data-timestamp="3276.67">We actually ran into Colin Pine in Chinatown in Houston at a tiny karaoke bar. Colin Pine was singing perfect Mandarin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:54:46.18" data-timestamp="3286.18">One woman knows so much about him, that she could have written this story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 6</h4><p begin="00:54:49.20" data-timestamp="3289.2">Well, he worked in the State Department, and he applied online and didn't think he would get the job, and was shocked when they called, and basically he was told he had to be here like yesterday. And he was excited because he was a huge Steve Francis fan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 7</h4><p begin="00:55:02.95" data-timestamp="3302.95">Before I think he was translating documents with the US government. He must be the luckiest man in the world right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 8</h4><p begin="00:55:08.33" data-timestamp="3308.33">That guy's got the best job in the world.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Fan 9</h4><p begin="00:55:10.03" data-timestamp="3310.03">I'd like to have his job.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:55:13.06" data-timestamp="3313.06">In my very informal survey, 50% of the crowd knows my cousin my name. One Chinese-American coed who carries a sign saying, "I'm single and bilingual-- hey Yao, you and me, let's mingle" tells me my cousin's hot. Colin's heard it before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:55:28.57" data-timestamp="3328.57">I've had girls pass me cards. Not often. It's not like-- the players get it all the time, I'm sure. But consciously and subconsciously, there's part of me that is really wary of the whole thing. You know, I want somebody to like me for the witty, intelligent, charming person that I am.</p><p begin="00:55:52.57" data-timestamp="3352.57">My friends are like, this job is so wasted on you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:55:57.36" data-timestamp="3357.36">You're up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Colin Pine</h4><p begin="00:55:58.30" data-timestamp="3358.3">Oh, it's me again.</p><p begin="00:56:00.58" data-timestamp="3360.58">[SINGING IN CHINESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jesse Hardman</h4><p begin="00:56:11.92" data-timestamp="3371.92">On a warm spring night, Yao, Colin, and I are out at a Chinese karaoke bar.

He's out of the house and his parents aren't around.</p><p begin="00:56:26.11" data-timestamp="3386.11">The club sits in a stucco Chinese mini mall in a cookie cutter Houston suburb between a nail salon and a takeout place called The Fancy Noodle.
