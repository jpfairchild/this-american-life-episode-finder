<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.70" data-timestamp="0.7">Hi, it's Ira Glass. Today's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> was first broadcast back in 2002, which actually explains the premise of the show, which was to do an entire program based on the classifieds section of the newspaper. Now, of course, Craigslist has taken the place of a lot of this classified advertising, putting the entire newspaper business in peril. So in just seven years, this has turned into a look at what once was. Here's the show.</p><p begin="00:00:23.83" data-timestamp="23.83">Marilyn Tanious has been working in the classifieds for 27 years at five different newspapers. And when she reads the ads, she sees things that you and I don't. The other day, she was sitting in her office at the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Sun-Times</i> with two of her colleagues and with me, flipping through the paper and telling stories. She talked about the gun ads that Timothy McVeigh used to take out in the <i>Arizona</i> <i>Republic</i>, back when she worked there, long before he blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma. Or there was the time that Marilyn's own mother caught a thief when some stuff that had been stolen from one of their neighbors showed up in the For Sale ads. Then Marilyn turned the page and spotted this ad in the used car section.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marilyn Tanious</h4><p begin="00:01:01.39" data-timestamp="61.39">OK, here's an ad. Here's an ad that tells me something. OK, I'm going to read this ad to you. And I'm going to see, what do you think it tells you. OK. "Volvo, '92, a four-door sedan, automatic, mint condition in and out, 37K, Texas car, exclamation point, properly maintained and serviced, mechanically perfect, needs nothing. Must see to believe, respect, and appreciate, $5,850," and the phone number.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:27.57" data-timestamp="87.57">She looks at the three of us like, well, isn't it obvious? Then she points at the ad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marilyn Tanious</h4><p begin="00:01:33.74" data-timestamp="93.74">This line, "must see to believe, respect, and appreciate," this person doesn't want to sell this car. Someone has forced him to sell this car. It's either his wife, they had a baby, they have to get a minivan. I can tell he doesn't want to sell the car. He's upset. Respect it. You must see to respect?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:00.19" data-timestamp="120.19">Marilyn says that, when you read your newspaper, you've got the news part of up front, which gives you the public life of the city.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marilyn Tanious</h4><p begin="00:02:05.58" data-timestamp="125.58">You have the sports. You have the entertainment. You have politics. But if you read the classifieds, it's really about individual, personal lives.</p><p begin="00:02:13.06" data-timestamp="133.06">It's, "My children are grown up, do I really need the piano anymore?" It's, "I'm really broke. I have to sell my possessions to live." I think you really get a sense of people's personal lives.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:28.79" data-timestamp="148.79">With that in mind, a few weeks ago, we the staff of this radio program, took one Sunday edition of the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Sun-Times</i>, and that same week's edition of the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Reader</i>, which is this weekly paper that we wanted to use, because of the musicians classifieds and the personal ads that they run. And then we hit the streets, tracking down the ads. For instance, "New, never worn wedding dress, tulle beaded bodice, $750 or best offer." There are several wedding dresses and a bunch of wedding rings for sale in the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Sun-Times.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:02:58.74" data-timestamp="178.74">Well, the bottom line was he didn't want to marry me anymore. And I'll never get out of the dress what I put into it. I know I'm not going to get the money, but I would like it to find a good home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:09.87" data-timestamp="189.87">This is the woman who's selling this old-fashioned-looking dress. Before she broke off the engagement, like in any relationship gone bad, every little thing seemed symbolic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:03:18.52" data-timestamp="198.52">I collected this Classic Pooh. You know, Disney has this line of Winnie the Pooh stuff. And he bought me Mickey Mouse. And I'm looking at it, going, "Why did you buy this?" And he said, "Well, they didn't have Classic Pooh." I'm like, "But I don't collect Mickey Mouse." It was just, I don't know. You know me, but you don't care.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:49.03" data-timestamp="229.03">The same weekend, two hours after talking to her, we followed up on this ad, "Agoraphobics In Motion, A-I-M, meets weekly in Lakeview East. Call for more details." Agoraphobics, you may or may not know, are people who fear going out into public, being around other people. And come Saturday at noon, when the meeting takes place, it's at a restaurant. And guess what? Only one person has the courage to show up there. Apparently, this is par for the course.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:04:16.76" data-timestamp="256.76">The nature of your fear is that you don't want to join groups. But you have to join a group to get help for the problem. So it turns into a little bit of a vicious circle.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:28.45" data-timestamp="268.45">Three hours later, a short drive away, there's this ad to answer. "House sale, featuring vintage furniture, linens, jewelry, books, postcards, and a steamer trunk. Same owner for over 80 years."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:04:40.12" data-timestamp="280.12">OK, we're trying to sell all the contents to help her pay for her nursing home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:45.43" data-timestamp="285.43">Kathy Gemperle and Pam Ball are running this house sale for a woman named Frances, who's lived here since 1919, but is not present today to see strangers pick through everything that she has ever owned. She saved everything and organized her pen pal correspondences, carbon copies of letters, old birthday cards, all in plastic bags. As a librarian, she had a big collection of children's books. And she'd write in the front of her books where she bought them, under what circumstances. And not only that--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:05:10.77" data-timestamp="310.77">She would write in a lot of these books, "Given to me by my dear brother." Well, he'd been dead for 30 years. So she would gift herself books and then write in the frontispiece that it was from them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 1</h4><p begin="00:05:26.27" data-timestamp="326.27">This is a book, and Frances wrote in it, "From my brothers Victor and Laurie in heaven, because I've always wanted this book. To Frances on Thanksgiving." And then it's dated November 21, 1980.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 2</h4><p begin="00:05:46.33" data-timestamp="346.33">I mean, the inscriptions in these, "There was a vacant spot in my heart. Now it's filled with a great love, a love that's everlasting, my love for Frances." Her mother.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:04.01" data-timestamp="364.01">In this one day of classifieds, there are all the people trying to adopt babies, and all the formerly adopted babies who are now adults looking for their parents. There's a church selling off all its furniture, and the death notice placed by Local 17 of the Heat and Frost Insulators Union for one of its members. There are those weird ads that say "I am not responsible for the debts of so-and-so." And, this is a real ad, [? "Dan Earler, ?] if your belongings are not removed from 6123 South Archer Road, they will be discarded." And there are prayers. There are lots of prayers, every day in the newspaper.</p><p begin="00:06:37.62" data-timestamp="397.62">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, distributed by Public Radio International. Today on our program, something we have never tried before, and we're not sure anybody has ever tried this before. We bring you an entire hour of stories found from one day's classifieds. We use the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Sun-Times</i> from Sunday, August 25, and the same week's edition of the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Reader.</i> The classifieds are a public space where intensely private thoughts are being expressed all the time, much like this radio program. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Lost And Found Ads</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:12.73" data-timestamp="432.73">OK, maybe this is a cheap move, but we're going to start our radio program today with the most poignant possible elements for any story. They are the lost and found column and a puppy. Here's the ad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:07:25.57" data-timestamp="445.57">Stolen dog, black, toy poodle named Isis. Stolen 7/27/02 from the Armitage-Kinzie area. Call 312-719-3669.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:36.10" data-timestamp="456.1">The production manager for our show, Todd Bachmann, who normally is not on the air, but who helps us get our show on the air, wanted to get in on the action this week. And he was the one to check out this ad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Todd Bachmann</h4><p begin="00:07:46.74" data-timestamp="466.74">When I saw this ad, the thing that hooked me was the word "stolen." The toy poodle wasn't lost, like most missing dogs are, but abducted. Leo, the author of this ad, was working in his garage while Isis played in the fenced yard just outside. When he came out, Isis was gone.</p><p begin="00:08:03.22" data-timestamp="483.22">His best guess about what happened is sort of incredible. Leo thinks Isis was taken by a puppy mill for breeding. Some neighborhood kids say they saw a woman come into Leo's yard and chase Isis around and around until she finally caught the toy poodle and ran off, kind of like a scene from <i>101 Dalmatians.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:08:19.52" data-timestamp="499.52">So when I asked the kids, then everything hit the rotary oscillator. I don't know. Being a locksmith, there's a right and a wrong. And what's mine is mine, and what's yours is yours. And I like to keep the status quo. OK? That's why I'm in the profession, to help keep that status quo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Todd Bachmann</h4><p begin="00:08:49.03" data-timestamp="529.03">Leo misses Isis, and says his older dog, a 13-year-old Shih Tzu named Button, misses her, too. Leo had big plans for Isis.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:08:56.70" data-timestamp="536.7">What I wanted to do was mate her with Button for puppies. Yeah, Shih Tzu and poodle, a shidoodle.

According to Leo, this family just didn't get Isis at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:09:36.82" data-timestamp="576.82">They called her Amber. The dog is jet black, all black, gloss black, curly hair, except for the little red in the mustache. And they called her Amber. I have no clue why anybody would call a black dog Amber.</p><p begin="00:09:52.75" data-timestamp="592.75">And once her face was shaved, immediately I thought of a black granite statue of the Egyptian goddess, Isis. And when I said Isis, she just perked up her years. And her hair stood on end. You could just see that, her face cocked and everything, she liked that word. So that was her name.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Todd Bachmann</h4><p begin="00:10:23.52" data-timestamp="623.52">I spent a few hours with Leo, running around in his minivan on his quest to rescue Isis.

The flyers also offer a reward of $20.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leo</h4><p begin="00:10:44.50" data-timestamp="644.5">I'm a small guy. And I could offer the $100 reward or something. But I don't want the people to think that they can just steal a dog and get a lot of reward. I want them to realize also that the person that they stole the dog from doesn't have much, that that's not wealthy.

<h3>Act Three: Musicians Classifieds</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:35.10" data-timestamp="1355.1">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. If you're just tuning in, all this hour, we're bringing you stories that we got from the classified ads that appeared on just one day, August 25, in the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Sun-Times,</i> and in the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Reader</i> that same week. Often with the classifieds, you'll come across an ad where somebody is looking for something. And then, practically right alongside that ad, there is somebody else who is offering the very thing that that person is seeking. You've seen this?</p><p begin="00:23:00.49" data-timestamp="1380.49">This seems to be especially true in the musicians classifieds. You'll see guitarist looking for drummer. And then right there, you'll see drummer looking for guitarist, right on the same page. It's kind of heartbreaking, really.</p><p begin="00:23:12.39" data-timestamp="1392.39">So we got to thinking, what if somebody were to play matchmaker for all of those people and do what all of us think when we see those ads? Well, our producer Starlee Kine recruited Jon Langford of the Mekons to do just that, to go through the classifieds and create a band, a band culled entirely from the classifieds, to play together for exactly one day, long enough to gather together in a recording studio to record their one and only song. Starlee?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:23:37.47" data-timestamp="1417.47">Jon's never had to turn to the classifieds for bandmates. His band, the Three Johns, were such close friends that all three of them slept in the same bed while on tour. His country punk band, the Waco Brothers, was started at a club one night as a way to get free beer. And the Mekons, who have been together for 25 years, is mostly people he went to school with in Leeds.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jon Langford</h4><p begin="00:23:54.61" data-timestamp="1434.61">We have never really decided to form a band. They've just kind of appeared. It's like, you'd be sitting around in the pub and saying, "Well, we need to be in a band. Everybody else is in a band. Why don't we have one?" And it's been people pretty close to yourself, and with similar tastes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:24:10.88" data-timestamp="1450.88">We chose seven different musicians. The only thing they had in common was that no two of them would have played together under any other imaginable circumstance. Ad number one, "Indie rock bassist and drummer available with practice bass in suburbs. Influences include Shellac, Fugazi, Mogwai, and Blonde Redhead. Contact Ben." This is from their demo.</p><p begin="00:24:30.48" data-timestamp="1470.48">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:24:37.70" data-timestamp="1477.7">Ad number two, "Smooth, sultry, soulful female vocalist seeks jazz musicians for band."</p><p begin="00:24:44.71" data-timestamp="1484.71">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:24:54.39" data-timestamp="1494.39">Ad three, an acid funk percussionist named Steve.

People's hearts are right there on the page. Our producer, Jonathan Goldstein, decided to look into one enigmatic personal ad that we saw in the paper. It read--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken</h4><p begin="00:38:25.76" data-timestamp="2305.76">Joyce, I don't want another housekeeper.

She broke contact with me after going out for approximately three, four months. There isn't a great deal to tell. Enjoyed food, drink, music, the typical things that people do. She was just a tremendous influence in my life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:39:04.25" data-timestamp="2344.25">So wait, about the house cleaning thing. Can you explain that?

I found out what she did for a living, which is something that was part of her mystique as I was going out with her. Some allusions were made to being something like a secretary. And it was something that I probably should have tried to make more sense out of. And I found out that she was a sexual surrogate.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:40:09.00" data-timestamp="2409">How do you mean? What is that?

I gave her a call. And she said to me, this changes everything, doesn't it?</p><p begin="00:40:38.92" data-timestamp="2438.92">And I was kind of caught off guard. I didn't know exactly what to say. So I just said that, like everything else, it changes everything, and it changes nothing. We're still who we are. But before I had a chance to say anything else, she said she didn't want me to call her again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:41:03.31" data-timestamp="2463.31">So the next time that you called her--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken</h4><p begin="00:41:05.99" data-timestamp="2465.99">That number was no longer functioning with her behind it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:41:16.41" data-timestamp="2476.41">So how hopeful were you when you put the ad in the paper that she would actually somehow see it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken</h4><p begin="00:41:21.89" data-timestamp="2481.89">It's just a shot in the dark, just an absolute shot in the dark. There's a Chinese poem. I forget who the poet was. But it's real simple and short.</p><p begin="00:41:38.80" data-timestamp="2498.8">And let's see if I can quote it correctly.

Do you have a lot of experience raising German shepherds?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:27.72" data-timestamp="2787.72">Yeah, but not around kids, really.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:29.72" data-timestamp="2789.72">No?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:30.53" data-timestamp="2790.53">No, not around kids.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:31.63" data-timestamp="2791.63">What do you think about them around kids?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:34.07" data-timestamp="2794.07">Well, they should be good, because when I was small, I had one. He was always [INAUDIBLE]. But you know what happened the other day?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:40.19" data-timestamp="2800.19">No, what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:46:41.00" data-timestamp="2801">Look, I'm normal, right? And then in August, three weeks ago, I got a makeover. And I changed my hair color. I put on perfume. I never put on perfume. And I changed everything, my clothes.</p><p begin="00:46:56.44" data-timestamp="2816.44">And there's this one dog, one of the German shepherd's, and she's a real mean bitch. And I hadn't been there in two weeks until last week. And then I went in there to the yard. You know what she did to me?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:47:07.17" data-timestamp="2827.17">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:07.67" data-timestamp="2827.67">She bit me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:47:12.54" data-timestamp="2832.54">What do you mean you had a makeover? You mean you changed the way you look? Now I'm curious.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:18.24" data-timestamp="2838.24">Yeah, I felt a little bit depressed and everything. So I changed everything. I changed my clothes. I changed everything. And I started going to a gym and everything. And I lost 10 pounds in, I don't know, in a month. And I don't know, I must have looked totally different for her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:47:30.55" data-timestamp="2850.55">That's funny. One of the reasons I'm looking for a dog is my life has changed a lot, too. My marriage has broken up, and I'm living by myself. And the kids are there a lot, but I'm thinking about getting a dog to make it more homey.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:44.23" data-timestamp="2864.23">Ah, cool. Cool. Yeah, well, they would be great around them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:47:49.43" data-timestamp="2869.43">What was your German shepherd like when you were a little kid?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:52.58" data-timestamp="2872.58">Oh, she was super-nice. She was nice. She slept in my room. And she slept on my bed also. Yeah, because I was very lonely.</p><p begin="00:48:03.31" data-timestamp="2883.31">I'm a very-- I don't talk to a lot of people. I'm more of a lonesome person. I don't know. I just slept with her, and I talked to her.</p><p begin="00:48:13.10" data-timestamp="2893.1">I've never told anybody. But yeah, I have, when I was sleeping, I used to hug her and everything. And she was like my older sister.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:48:23.27" data-timestamp="2903.27">Were your mom and dad together?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:48:25.78" data-timestamp="2905.78">They've always been together. But my dad, he's like this-- he's not mean. He's not mean. But he has this way of being. He never talks to us. He never hugs us or tells us things. So I was [UNINTELLIGIBLE] with a dog.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:48:40.81" data-timestamp="2920.81">Do you think you'll always have a dog?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:48:43.04" data-timestamp="2923.04">Yeah. I think I need a little friend. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:48:52.19" data-timestamp="2932.19">What would you like a dog to be like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:48:56.98" data-timestamp="2936.98">Playful-ish, cuddly, soft, and stuff like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:49:07.83" data-timestamp="2947.83">What kind of dog do you think I should call about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:49:10.60" data-timestamp="2950.6">One that stays small. I don't want a big one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:49:15.63" data-timestamp="2955.63">Like what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:49:16.57" data-timestamp="2956.57">I don't know. No, one of the little ones that Britney Spears has and Mariah Carey has. They're this big, and they're so cute.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:49:24.90" data-timestamp="2964.9">And that means you can carry them around with them like little babies, is that the idea?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:49:29.69" data-timestamp="2969.69">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:49:32.32" data-timestamp="2972.32">I don't want to do that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:49:33.45" data-timestamp="2973.45">Well, I don't want a big one that, like, ugh.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:49:39.89" data-timestamp="2979.89">How about a beagle? What do you think of beagles?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Son</h4><p begin="00:49:42.86" data-timestamp="2982.86">I love beagles!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:49:44.45" data-timestamp="2984.45">I love them!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:49:45.43" data-timestamp="2985.43">Oh, I want a beagle.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:49:50.95" data-timestamp="2990.95">Hello?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:49:52.37" data-timestamp="2992.37">Hi there.

They're very friendly. They're very lovable. They demand love. And they demand passion from their owner.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:50:10.90" data-timestamp="3010.9">How do they demand it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:13.29" data-timestamp="3013.29">By following you around, wanting to hug on you, and wanting to jump up on you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:50:19.40" data-timestamp="3019.4">Do you think a dog can love you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:21.66" data-timestamp="3021.66">Oh, yes. I've got a dog that's a poodle that's particularly mine. And I have a bad heart. And every time that I go in the hospital, she's lost. She'll sit and scratch at every door in the house. She'll go to the window and scratch. She'll sit and look for me every place in the house. If I'm in bed, she'll stay in bed with me until I get up to make sure that I'm getting up. If I lay back down in bed, she'll get back in bed.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:50:54.12" data-timestamp="3054.12">So she just sticks with you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:55.47" data-timestamp="3055.47">Yeah. We love our dogs. Yeah, I need a heart.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:03.12" data-timestamp="3063.12">It's down to that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:04.04" data-timestamp="3064.04">Oh, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:06.60" data-timestamp="3066.6">Are you on a waiting list?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:08.27" data-timestamp="3068.27">Nope.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:10.30" data-timestamp="3070.3">How's that going to work, then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:13.00" data-timestamp="3073">You live with your life as you can. Maybe I'll come back as a dog.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:51:26.40" data-timestamp="3086.4">I think you should get one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:28.99" data-timestamp="3088.99">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:51:30.20" data-timestamp="3090.2">Because, then when we're not here, you'll have someone to keep you company, and someone to take care of when we're not here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:36.76" data-timestamp="3096.76">You think I'm lonely?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:51:40.22" data-timestamp="3100.22">I'm sure sometimes you get lonely. Everyone gets lonely sometimes.</p><p begin="00:51:44.93" data-timestamp="3104.93">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:52:04.45" data-timestamp="3124.45">It's 4:00 AM. I'm in the bedroom. A dog explains those extraneous noises of an empty house. It breathes the same air with you. It needs an occasional conversation, a hand on the back, more so than a cockatiel or a python, anyway. It stays with you, even in the middle of the night, at 4:00 AM, when you've woken with a harsh taste in your mouth, and you're writing on a yellow legal pad in the dim light, and only the crickets and the wind outside, like now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:52:45.89" data-timestamp="3165.89">The only pets I have now, and one of them is-- I have three kids. They're five, 10, and 15. And we have a snake that belongs to my son, who's 10. And we have a cockatiel. But a dog would be a big jump from a snake and a bird.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:53:03.01" data-timestamp="3183.01">Yeah. But you get a lot more affection from the dog than you would a bird and a snake.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:53:09.29" data-timestamp="3189.29">That's right. That's right. And I think sometimes my kids worry that I'm lonely in the house by myself. I think they'd like me to have a dog, because they would think that it would keep me company.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:53:19.37" data-timestamp="3199.37">Oh, I'm sure. They're always waiting for you. They're always happy to see you, no matter what happens.</p><p begin="00:53:27.17" data-timestamp="3207.17">I mean, I lived with a man that beat me and held a gun on me. And I'd go to bed at night and wonder if that was the night was going to be my last night on earth. And I don't know. I just have such peace and happiness with the dogs.</p><p begin="00:53:47.15" data-timestamp="3227.15">And to spend a day-- I said, if the Lord, if I knew the last day I had on earth, I would just want to be totally away from human beings and just let me brush my dogs, and clean my dogs. And I enjoy grooming those dogs. I can totally get lost. Just give me a dog, a brush, and a table, and forget you know me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:22.22" data-timestamp="3262.22">So we haven't decided on a dog yet. I'm dropping by the pound, just to see. Really, the fellowship of looking for a dog seems to help. Everybody in their lives has holes to fill. And they're even willing to talk about it, when you are. And that's good for now. The kids and I have plenty of time to get a dog.</p><p begin="00:54:47.51" data-timestamp="3287.51">By the way, here's the rest of the list of things I put in this house. Electric fans, a gas stove with visible flame for heat. New pictures of the kids in frames. Lots of old kerosene lanterns, good for parties, good for storms.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:04.07" data-timestamp="3304.07">One thing I went nuts buying was old kerosene lanterns. What do you think of that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:55:08.44" data-timestamp="3308.44">Yeah, no kidding. I think it's cheesy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:11.21" data-timestamp="3311.21">Cheesy? Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:55:12.17" data-timestamp="3312.17">Because you have one hanging from every tree in the backyard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:15.95" data-timestamp="3315.95">Don't you think it's cozy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:55:17.53" data-timestamp="3317.53">No, I don't. Sometimes. You just have a special soft spot for them, because you had them when you were living in West Virginia.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:26.64" data-timestamp="3326.64">I've started a collection of rocks taken from places we visit, and kitchen knives, old carbon steel ones, scooters, and helmets, a camera.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:55:37.73" data-timestamp="3337.73">Photograph us. Daddy. Here we are. Take a picture. We look cute.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:46.61" data-timestamp="3346.61">Walkie talkies, colorful flannel sheets for the kids, and a gun. And the first thing, the first thing I got when I moved in, was rugs to soften everything, to mute the empty sound, rugs on the floor of my house when I moved in, so I could circle three times and lie down, like a dog.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:56:19.61" data-timestamp="3379.61">Is there anything else I should get for this house to make it seem homier?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:56:24.04" data-timestamp="3384.04">Wall-to-wall carpeting.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:56:26.53" data-timestamp="3386.53">Wall-to-wall carpeting in this old house?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:56:28.95" data-timestamp="3388.95">Yeah. It would be so much cozier in this house if you had wall-to-wall carpeting.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:56:34.08" data-timestamp="3394.08">But when I first moved in here, do you remember how many rugs I got?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jay Allison's Daughter</h4><p begin="00:56:37.24" data-timestamp="3397.24">Yeah, but rug, schmug.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:41.89" data-timestamp="3401.89">Jay Allison, he never did get that dog for the kids. They are now 12, 17, and 21, though Jay recently remarried. And last month, he and his wife had an incredibly cute son. His radio story got support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, for the Open Studio Project. And you can hear more of Jay's work at transom.org.</p></div> </div>
