<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.56" data-timestamp="0.56">For years, David liked playing this not so well-known board game, called Diplomacy, where he would get to do things and act in ways that he would never do in his regular life. He describes the game as a cross between Risk, poker, and the television show, <i>Survivor.</i> Basically, there's a map of Europe, you're assigned a country, and you're trying to take over the world.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:00:22.05" data-timestamp="22.05">There's no dice. There's no element of chance.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:25.25" data-timestamp="25.25">And so is it about, like, bluffing and alliances, and stuff?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:00:28.04" data-timestamp="28.04">Yeah. There's a lot. Alliances are key to the game, because you play with seven players. The only way for anybody to sort of overtake anyone else is for two people to team up against one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:37.70" data-timestamp="37.7">Team up and attack, that is. Before each turn, there's 15 minutes where everybody negotiates with everybody else about who's going to work with whom. And then everybody goes off and writes down on pieces of paper who it is that they're going to attack. And then all the papers are read out loud, and everybody finds out who is aligned with who and who double-crossed whom. People stab each other in the back so much in this game, they don't even take the time to say the full phrase-- "stabbed in the back." Everybody just calls it "stabbing."</p><p begin="00:01:04.36" data-timestamp="64.36">David played with a group of guys, his buddies, always by email. Once a week, they would email each other the next moves, which meant that the game would take months. David thought he knew what he was doing, but his friends wondered about him sometimes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:01:17.53" data-timestamp="77.53">You know, there was a time when I made, like, a pornographic Photoshop of this one player with his phone number and his social security number on it, and I told him that I was going to post it on the internet if he didn't cooperate with me. And you know, I think that some of the people in the game felt like that was-- that had crossed the line, like, that was out of bounds.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:41.37" data-timestamp="101.37">Wait. You took Photoshop, and you basically took his head, or face, and put it into a porno image with his social security number and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:01:50.54" data-timestamp="110.54">--his phone number, and I think I put where he worked.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:53.51" data-timestamp="113.51">And you threatened to put that online. And you were serious?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:01:58.37" data-timestamp="118.37">I don't know. I figured it would work, so I didn't know if I was bluffing or not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:03.02" data-timestamp="123.02">Wait, and so the people who you were playing with thought that that crossed the line. Why doesn't that cross the line?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:02:09.17" data-timestamp="129.17">It's definitely crossing the line. But the thing about diplomacy, I think, is kind of sick is that people will tell you nothing is out of bounds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:17.93" data-timestamp="137.93">Well, maybe not nothing. But it's a game with a certain amount of yelling and bullying and psychological manipulation. And the boundary line is not always so clear on what you should be doing. Another time that it seemed like David might not be perceiving where that line is the same way that his opponents did. It came at the very first game that he played with other people, in person-- like not on email. He had wanted to play, in person, for years, but his buddies weren't into that. And so finally he got his chance when a friend invited him to an informal tournament in Connecticut.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:02:46.97" data-timestamp="166.97">And I was sure that I would love it. And I rode out there with him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:51.26" data-timestamp="171.26">And so where was it? How many people?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:02:53.55" data-timestamp="173.55">It was in this weird mansion on the coast of Connecticut. And I don't know, there might have been--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:59.93" data-timestamp="179.93">Of course it was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:00.89" data-timestamp="180.89">There might have been like 50 people there, and the people were like camped out in the yard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:03.44" data-timestamp="183.44">Mhm. It was at midnight, and the wind was howling, and the lightning was striking. And--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:07.46" data-timestamp="187.46">It was, like, on a cliff overlooking-- it was like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:09.26" data-timestamp="189.26">Is this true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:09.74" data-timestamp="189.74">This is true. It was just some sort of rich family that loved Diplomacy. And so they would host people at their home. It was definitely a weird scene. It was like-- it was this really fancy house, and people all, sort of-- there were boards all over the house and out in the yard. People were all, sort of, playing Diplomacy. And the first game that I played, I was really digging it. You know, I thought, this feels good, and I feel like I can hang with these guys, and I was playing well and totally didn't feel out of my element.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:41.27" data-timestamp="221.27">Did you win?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:42.08" data-timestamp="222.08">I did not win. In fact, I stabbed a guy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:46.97" data-timestamp="226.97">Stabbed a guy-- he double-crossed him. They were allies, but then David saw a way to take some of his territories, and he teamed up with a different guy against him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:03:55.67" data-timestamp="235.67">And after the move was over, the guy that I stabbed wanted to talk to me. And he pulled me aside, and he says, why did you do that? And I was, like, I'm sorry, man. I didn't really think that I could work with you. I wanted to work with this other guy. And he goes, you can go fuck yourself. And he puts his finger in my face. And I said, what?</p><p begin="00:04:16.70" data-timestamp="256.7">And he storms over to the board and, like, knocks his stuff over and says, I quit. I'm done with this asshole. Fuck this guy. And he is storming around the house, making this big scene. Everybody in the tournament is, like, watching us.</p><p begin="00:04:30.80" data-timestamp="270.8">And I'm freaking out. I'm like, is this serious? Is he serious about this? And he's like, this fucking guy, and he's pointing at me and yelling. And then I watch him go around the house to every board, and like, tell the story of what just happened to his friends.</p><p begin="00:04:44.39" data-timestamp="284.39">And like, I can see him pointing at me. I asked the people on the board-- I said, I, don't understand what's going on, you know? Why is he doing this? I don't get what this is about. Like, all I did was stab him. And they're like, uh, you know, you were a little bit out of line. You were a little bit rude.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:58.35" data-timestamp="298.35">Or maybe he had not been rude. Maybe he did nothing wrong. Maybe this guy was just pretending to be mad to mess with David's head, pretending to be a hothead, because that image could be useful with all of the other opponents in the coming rounds of the tournament. David had no idea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:05:13.35" data-timestamp="313.35">So I'm like looking around the room, and I'm realizing, I don't know anybody here. Like, I really felt at that point like I couldn't trust anybody. Then the people in my game who were throwing their arm around me, and be like-- he's just messing with your head, don't worry, come over here and talk to me. You know, I was like-- I don't know how to process this. And I also felt like-- this is too intense. I can't handle this, and I feel so uncomfortable. So I just got up and left and left the tournament.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:37.46" data-timestamp="337.46">You left?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:05:38.16" data-timestamp="338.16">Yeah. And I never played Diplomacy again after that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:42.54" data-timestamp="342.54">Years passed. And then he saw that the world Diplomacy championship was going to be in the United States this year. And he thought, maybe he would try to play it one more time and record it for our program. David's a reporter. His full name is David Hill. He usually writes about sports for the website Grantland. And he vowed that this time, playing Diplomacy was going to be different.</p><p begin="00:06:02.19" data-timestamp="362.19">He knew that he needed a new approach to the game, right, because he couldn't even figure out why other players were reacting to his moves the way that they were. Like, this was a game where you're supposed to stab people in the back, but the way that he was doing it, people were just freaking out. He lacked diplomacy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:06:16.95" data-timestamp="376.95">Well, this time, I figured what I really needed was somebody who could teach me tactics, like diplomatic tactics-- you know, the tactics of diplomacy-- so that I could go into the game confident that I was playing correctly, that I wasn't making any mistakes. So I found somebody who could sort of be my coach.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:36.63" data-timestamp="396.63">And that person was not a gamer. That person was a diplomat, an actual real life diplomat-- in fact, one that you may have heard of, Dennis Ross, probably best known as President Clinton's Middle East envoy.

And in case you're wondering how this man, who's not just brokered international deals, but done it in some of the most contentious conflicts in the world, responded when he was asked to use his expertise and give advice to somebody at the world championship for the board game Diplomacy, well, once it was explained to him what the board game is, his answer was-- sure, sounds like fun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:07:22.24" data-timestamp="442.24">Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Ross</h4><p begin="00:07:22.69" data-timestamp="442.69">Hey.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:07:23.15" data-timestamp="443.15">Nice to meet you.

Most of them were middle aged men. All of them were nerds-- and not the Chris Hardwick, Olivia Munn, kind of nerd, homespun nerds-- the real deal-- nerds from all over the world, in a prototypical nerd setting, a basement-- in this case, the dim basement of a dorm at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p><p begin="00:08:57.05" data-timestamp="537.05">I strutted into that dorm with diplomat Dennis Ross by my side. I was worried about intimidating the other players. I didn't need to worry. Nobody was scared-- amused maybe. Only one person in this room had counseled four presidents, and everyone's reaction was-- meh. In fact, the tournament director felt he had to rig the game in our favor by assigning me Russia, the strongest of the seven countries on the board. When they announced the assignments, people actually laughed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman Diplomacy Announcer</h4><p begin="00:09:27.54" data-timestamp="567.54">David Hill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:09:28.52" data-timestamp="568.52">Russia.</p><p begin="00:09:29.25" data-timestamp="569.25">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man Diplomacy Announcer</h4><p begin="00:09:30.44" data-timestamp="570.44">So what I want you to do--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:09:31.68" data-timestamp="571.68">I quickly lost my confidence.

He's doing it in a way where it doesn't look like he's trying to ask you to do things, when he actually is asking you to do something. And the Turkish player, I think, is the one guy who is committed to you in a way that, I think, is most convincing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:12:26.52" data-timestamp="746.52">Dennis said that Turkey reminded him of someone, someone named Sergey Tereshchenko. Tereshchenko was the Soviet Foreign Minister's Chief Assistant.

And the way he said it to me made me feel like it wasn't a manipulation. The way he said it was almost exactly the way the person who is playing Turkey conveyed-- I'm going to be there. Even the inflection was the same. I mean, for me, it's like I had this memory, sort of, flash before me, as I listened to him say it and the way he said it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:13:16.44" data-timestamp="796.44">Sold. I allied with Turkey. This turned out to be smart. Later in the game, there were plenty of moments where I simply had no idea what the hell was going on. But Turkey knew what he was doing, and he had an interest in keeping me alive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Turkey</h4><p begin="00:13:30.12" data-timestamp="810.12">Since you're my number one ally, I'll just tell you, if you go down, I go down.

Italy was one of the best players on the board, a former world champion, named Chris Martin. But saying yes to Italy meant turning against Turkey, and Turkey had been a loyal ally. So Dennis said no. It's like they say. You've got to dance with the one that brung you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Ross</h4><p begin="00:14:33.00" data-timestamp="873">I still think that, even though Italy is clearly the stronger player, Turkey is a more reliable player.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:14:42.03" data-timestamp="882.03">I was still so nervous, I kept out of the fighting for as long as I could. I watched Germany and England turn on France and eliminate him from the game. I couldn't stall forever. I knew that eventually I'd have to go to war. I just didn't know who I should fight. But Dennis watched me talking to Germany, who bears a more than passing resemblance to Jason Statham. I was so anxious, you could hear me tapping my lapel mic with a pen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Germany</h4><p begin="00:15:06.18" data-timestamp="906.18">All right.

This is just what I wanted to hear. My experience with playing cutthroat, like, when I blackmailed my friend or got cussed out in that creepy mansion, always ended badly.

So were the other people in my alliance.</p><p begin="00:17:05.92" data-timestamp="1025.92">But the other side wanted more points. More points would give them a better shot at winning the world championship. So they pulled each person from my side into the hall, one by one.

So maybe that's why I'm tired of people telling me that I fucked the game up or that I should play differently, when maybe, you should play differently, and you should diplome better.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:21:15.05" data-timestamp="1275.05">Eventually my ally, a high school math teacher named Brian, ended up stabbing me. He watched me go to the mat with the other players to defend him, then he chopped me out of the game for a few extra points. I was incredulous. I pulled him aside and asked him why he sold me out. He said, I guess I'm just a hard motherfucker like that, and turned and walked away.</p><p begin="00:21:37.76" data-timestamp="1297.76">I am not a hard motherfucker, not even in a game. I really wanted to play the game of diplomacy using actual diplomacy, being respectful and truthful, and it didn't work. I felt frustrated and angry. And my only consolation was-- at least Dennis Ross thought I'd make a good diplomat. I mean, that's what he told me, so who cares what these nerds think.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Ross</h4><p begin="00:22:00.13" data-timestamp="1320.13">Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:22:01.55" data-timestamp="1321.55">I didn't win the tournament, Ambassador Ross.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dennis Ross</h4><p begin="00:22:05.15" data-timestamp="1325.15">You know, I didn't bet the house on you doing that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Hill</h4><p begin="00:22:09.77" data-timestamp="1329.77">After I got back home, I called Dennis Ross.

Act 2, "By the Waters of Haggle-On." You may have heard this audio on the internet. A guy named Ryan Block called Comcast to cancel his internet service. He wanted to change to a different provider.

At this point, 5 million people have listened to this online. And I think that it is so popular because so many of us have been in some situation like this, where against some company, we feel totally powerless. Well, every other week in The Haggler column in <i>The</i> <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i>, people write in with their unsolvable consumer problems. And then reporter David Segal steps in and takes their side. He has their back. He publicly approaches the company and tries to get them to do the right thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:25:26.71" data-timestamp="1526.71">I work on behalf of people who have been driven insane by indifference, insane by the experience of knocking on a door, knowing that someone is on the other side of that door, and they will not respond. If you can get those people behind the door to respond, it's like a magic trick. It feels like a magic trick to the reader.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:46.44" data-timestamp="1546.44">A while back, David Segal stepped in for a guy-- he said that he had signed up for a free trial of e-greeting cards from a company called Blue Mountain Greeting Cards. The company required his credit card info to give him the free trial, and so he did that, and then he clicked some buttons. And then the next thing he knew, they told him that he was a monthly subscriber. So he tried to cancel, right? This is from his email to David Segal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:26:08.98" data-timestamp="1568.98">I went back to the Cancel page. But it just said-- we are sorry, but we are unable to process your cancellation request, right now-- end quote. Funny, isn't it, that once you've paid, you can't cancel. I'm out $19.99. Can you get it back? William Potash, Brookline, Mass. So I got in touch with Blue Mountain, and they fixed this problem really quickly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:32.75" data-timestamp="1592.75">So good news, right? David tried to reach the consumer, which he always does for the column. And suddenly, this guy who had been emailing him back and forth for days stopped returning his emails. His column deadline approached. David got a little more frantic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:26:45.82" data-timestamp="1605.82">And so I just went all out. I was like-- I got research to find his mother in New Jersey. I tried to find out where he worked, just to like, get this information. I need to speak to you. Finally, like late on Thursday night, I get a call from a guy named Phil Potash. And he's like, hey, I understand you're trying to get in touch with me. And I said, yeah, you wrote to me-- William Potash? He said, oh no, I'm not William Potash, I'm Phil Potash. I'm like, who's William Potash? He said, that's my 10-year-old son.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:17.90" data-timestamp="1637.9">Oh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:27:18.55" data-timestamp="1638.55">It was a boy who had written me, completely convincingly as an adult. It was this completely-- you know, credit card-- it was written, like, just deadpan as an adult. And I think the kid decided-- I don't want to get on the phone with this guy, because he's going to hear that I'm a 10-year-old boy. I remember sitting with friends saying, like, what could explain why William Potash won't call me back? Let's rack our brains. What could explain this? Please, like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:45.93" data-timestamp="1665.93">And what was your theory?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:27:47.26" data-timestamp="1667.26">I had no idea. I remember being completely stunned. And it turned out, he's 10 years old. He doesn't want to talk to me, because he hasn't hit puberty.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:03.13" data-timestamp="1683.13">When you write a column like this, of course, tons of people get in touch, wanting you to take their side and get their backs. And the overwhelming majority, David Segal says, he simply cannot help. Like 95 out of 100, he cannot help, because he says these customers, they're not in their right. They are--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:28:20.98" data-timestamp="1700.98">People who don't have a legitimate beef. And this is most common with warranties. So they bought something five years ago. It had a three year warranty, The Haggler should step in and get a refund.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:34.15" data-timestamp="1714.15">Wait, and they understand that? They understand that the warranty ran out two years ago?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Segal</h4><p begin="00:28:37.72" data-timestamp="1717.72">Yeah. There's a fair amount of that. Here's someone who wanted something from a camera store. And they said, we don't have it. We don't have it in stock anymore. So let's refund your money. And he's like, I don't want a refund, I want the thing that I ordered. And they're like, well, we don't have the thing you ordered, so let us send you your money back. And he writes to me, and is like, can you make them send me the thing that I want? And I'm like, no, they don't have it. Like, what am I supposed to do?</p><p begin="00:29:07.42" data-timestamp="1747.42">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:29:09.38" data-timestamp="1749.38">I don't really understand how I can help at all.

<h3>Act Three: One Woman Show</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:59.39" data-timestamp="1859.39">One Woman Show. There's this woman named, Hamida Gulistani. She advocates for women's rights in Afghanistan, helping women who are being beaten by their husbands or forced into terrible arranged marriages. And doing this work in Afghanistan is just as hard a job as whatever it is that you're imagining when I say those words. And for a few years, when the US presence in the country was at its greatest, she did feel like somebody had her back. She felt safer. She saw some progress.</p><p begin="00:31:25.55" data-timestamp="1885.55">But now with the US pulling out, her situation is changing. It's gotten way more dangerous already. We do not have her back in the same way at all. For two and a half years, Kevin Sieff has been the Bureau Chief for <i>The</i> <i>Washington</i> <i>Post</i> in Afghanistan, and he has this story about the change that she is facing. A quick trigger warning, for anybody who needs a trigger warning, that this story does include descriptions of incidents of violence against women. Here's Kevin Sieff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:31:51.51" data-timestamp="1911.51">Before the US was there as her ally, Hamida was pretty much on her own, doing a job she invented for herself out of nothing. She had no role models. She completely made the whole thing up. She started doing this in 2005.</p><p begin="00:32:04.50" data-timestamp="1924.5">At the time, she had just gotten a nursing job at a clinic in a place called Ghazni City. It's a sprawl of mostly mud-baked buildings in eastern Afghanistan. At the clinic, Hamida basically had a front row seat to how brutally women were still being treated four years after the American invasion. Patients arrived all the time, in burkas with bruises and broken bones.</p><p begin="00:32:25.38" data-timestamp="1945.38">One day, a pregnant woman showed up at the examination room.</p><p begin="00:32:28.61" data-timestamp="1948.61">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:32:32.91" data-timestamp="1952.91">As she laid down, I noticed that she had, like, these brown dark spots around her eyes. And then also, as she lifted up her arm, I could see she had all these scars. And I asked her what happened. She wouldn't tell me at the beginning. She said, oh, you know, I fell. Well, I just joked with her, too. I said, oh, I fell once, too, and you know, I was also hurt.</p><p begin="00:32:54.91" data-timestamp="1974.91">And then she all of the sudden starts crying. She had guests over, and somehow she had messed up the food, and husband, you know, had beaten her up. And she lost her baby when she was two months pregnant because of the beating.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:33:10.32" data-timestamp="1990.32">Hamida convinced her to go to the press. Afghan media outlets have popped up in Ghazni, because of funding from the US. And Hamida thought, a woman speaking out against her husband would be news. Maybe they could use the local media to shame the woman's husband. Maybe they could even get the local Prosecutor's attention.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:33:27.54" data-timestamp="2007.54">We had, like, this little mini press conference in this private clinic, basically. It forced the husband to come out and apologize to his wife and he said, he was very sorry. And also, he spent six months in jail. To be honest, after that day, the examination room in the little clinic turned into the office of women's rights.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:33:49.58" data-timestamp="2029.58">How many calls were you getting? I mean, after this first incident, was your phone just ringing all the time?</p><p begin="00:33:54.99" data-timestamp="2034.99">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:33:58.01" data-timestamp="2038.01">Basically, we got very busy, to the point like, OK, I'm here working, trying to help a patient-- all of the sudden, I'd get a call-- so-and-so incident happened in this village. And then I would just take off my uniform and rush to that village. And that's why I was pretty much fired from the hospital, because it got to a point that I couldn't work even for one hour.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:34:28.95" data-timestamp="2068.95">Hamida basically became a one woman emergency response team, a de facto point of contact for women who were abused, forced into marriages, or refused divorces. Her phone number got passed all over Ghazni. She realized she didn't have the legal system on her side, she didn't have local officials on her side, but the Americans were encouraging Afghans to recognize women's rights. And the one tool Hamida had with the media, which she used.</p><p begin="00:34:55.53" data-timestamp="2095.53">This was something new in Afghanistan. She'd drag along the press when she'd go to see a local Imam in a remote village. The best way to help a woman facing domestic violence was to get the local religious leader involved, so she had a strategy. She'd call the Imam.</p><p begin="00:35:09.45" data-timestamp="2109.45">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:35:14.26" data-timestamp="2114.26">And I would tell him, I've heard of this incident happening in your village. I was wondering if I could come there and talk to you and get your opinion on this matter, and basically, not leave room for them to sort of say yes or no. And then I would just go out there.</p><p begin="00:35:29.69" data-timestamp="2129.69">Imams would tell me, yes, this woman, she's bad herself. It's all her problems. And I would say, yes, of course. And then what I will do is, then I will take the Imam with me. And we would go together to the house where the domestic violence was taking place.</p><p begin="00:35:50.07" data-timestamp="2150.07">And what I would often also do is to make sure we have someone from the media with us, because once the media is there, the Imams would, of course, not say anything bad about women's rights.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:36:00.86" data-timestamp="2160.86">With a reporter there, the Imam usually would be helpful.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:36:03.98" data-timestamp="2163.98">And then, as we were walking out, I would tell the Imam, you have been very helpful. You're a very respectful member of the community. And in front of the media, that just really helps and boost their self-esteem. And the Imams would be very happy, and they give, like, yes, we will help you, anything you want.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:36:21.07" data-timestamp="2181.07">For cases where women didn't want any media attention, Hamida would just show up at the family's house and ad hoc her way to an intervention. A lot of times, there was a conflict between the woman and her own family, mostly involving arranged marriages. A woman once came to Hamida. She said her father was about to marry her off to a drug addict.</p><p begin="00:36:39.85" data-timestamp="2199.85">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:36:40.64" data-timestamp="2200.64">I took her, and I went to the family. And I just told them, like, look, you guys can't do that. You can't marry this beautiful lady to a person who is a drug addict. I said, you know, before anything happens, we need to go to the local attorney general's office. So we all went to the attorney general's office. In there, there was a really nice prosecutor. He looked into the case, and they decided, according to Islam, the woman has every right to refuse marriage to someone who is a drug addict. And we basically won the case.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:37:12.16" data-timestamp="2232.16">What happened to the girl after this case was settled by the Attorney General?</p><p begin="00:37:15.46" data-timestamp="2235.46">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:37:17.83" data-timestamp="2237.83">She's happily married.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:37:20.47" data-timestamp="2240.47">To a man that she chose to marry?</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:37:22.87" data-timestamp="2242.87">I'm not quite sure, but I was invited to her wedding party. I went in there, and she seemed quite happy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:37:35.37" data-timestamp="2255.37">Nine years after she first started, Hamida still operates pretty much the same way. She keeps track of all of her cases in a gruesome notebook. It's full of pictures she's taken of victims with her digital camera-- handcuffed girls standing in prison, women who have almost been beaten to death. Hamida carries an old black cell phone with her all the time. And it's constantly ringing with calls from women who want her help.</p><p begin="00:37:58.05" data-timestamp="2278.05">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:38:00.60" data-timestamp="2280.6">Sometimes, my husband gets tired of me. So when we're sitting around dinner table, and I get a call, he just looks at me and says, please leave. A lot of times, literally, what happens-- I miss my food. It gets cold because I spend all of the time on the phone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:38:20.40" data-timestamp="2300.4">It didn't take long for the Americans to notice Hamida. They'd hoped to find Afghan women who would take up the cause of women's rights. And here she was, exactly what they were looking for-- someone outspoken, aggressive, and willing to risk her life. So they met Hamida and involved her in meetings with top Afghan leaders.</p><p begin="00:38:38.62" data-timestamp="2318.62">She even came to Washington, DC, as part of a State Department program. Now Hamida is a big deal. Lots of Afghans know who she is. See's on the Provincial Council in Ghazni. It's their version of the State Senate. She's also on popular national TV shows all the time, like this one, called <i>The</i> <i>People's</i> <i>Voice</i>.</p><p begin="00:38:56.20" data-timestamp="2336.2">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:39:00.59" data-timestamp="2340.59">In one segment, she's wearing eyeshadow, lipstick, and high heels. She's in her 40s, the only woman on a big panel of men. She fields questions from young women in the audience.</p><p begin="00:39:10.08" data-timestamp="2350.08">[SPEAKING DARI]</p><p begin="00:39:13.47" data-timestamp="2353.47">This woman asks why the Afghan government talks so much about women's rights, but doesn't actually do anything. Why are women still having trouble going to school and being out in public? I asked my translator to tell me Hamida's response.</p><p begin="00:39:25.20" data-timestamp="2365.2">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:39:28.26" data-timestamp="2368.26">I have been the one who has taken your grieving voices, from those women who've endured violence, from those who were kidnapped, from those who have been murdered to the Presidential Palace, and to the human rights officials. Let me make it clear that I haven't received a satisfactory answer, and that your rights, they will not give it to you as a gift. Your rights is something that you have to defend.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:39:54.63" data-timestamp="2394.63">She's one of the few women in Afghanistan willing to criticize the government so publicly on national television. In Hamida's view, what she's doing only seems radical because Afghanistan has changed so much since she was a girl. In the 1970s and '80s, it was a far more liberal place. It was a society dominated by men, but her father would never insult his daughters or humiliate them or beat them. She knew women who wore skirts and sleeveless shirts.</p><p begin="00:40:21.30" data-timestamp="2421.3">But Hamida remembers when all that changed-- when the Mujahideen took over the country. A rocket hit their house. Her cousin was injured. Everyone was going to the hospital, and her brother stopped her.</p><p begin="00:40:32.73" data-timestamp="2432.73">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:40:34.90" data-timestamp="2434.9">And I said, no, I want to go. And he said, no, you cannot come, just stay at home. The harsh thing about this moment was the fact that my brother was younger than me. And I realized that even he was younger, because I'm a girl, now, he has more power than I do. It felt as if, almost overnight, a new culture fell from the skies on us, and we had to abide by it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:41:09.24" data-timestamp="2469.24">Hamida had been helping women in Ghazni for four years when President Obama announced the troop surge in 2009, and many of those soldiers and Marines were dispatched to Ghazni. It's part of the Taliban's heartland. At one point, the province had about 20 American bases and several thousand American troops. For the first time, Hamida had real, physical protection, international attention, and legitimacy in the eyes of her own skeptical government.</p><p begin="00:41:35.04" data-timestamp="2495.04">The world's superpower had her back. And it gave her a sense of invincibility. She threw a big celebration in 2010 for Women's Day, and the US Ambassador's wife showed up. US troops came to help with security, and there was a huge turnout-- something that would have been hard to imagine before. Women in Ghazni were often confined to their homes. Things weren't perfect, but they seemed to be moving in the right direction.</p><p begin="00:41:58.59" data-timestamp="2518.59">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:42:01.62" data-timestamp="2521.62">You have to understand there were, like, American women in uniform coming to the villages and sitting on the ground, on dusty ground, and talking to women. And Afghan women, looking at the American women with uniforms-- it just gave them a huge morale boost, that they could see themselves differently.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:42:28.00" data-timestamp="2548">But after just a few years, in 2013, Americans were withdrawing from Ghazni, as a part of the larger plan to end the war. For months now, they've been tearing down bases all over Afghanistan. And when you drive around the country, they already look like ancient artifacts-- sort of like Pompeii, with rusty razor wire. Hamida's American contacts in the province were now suddenly gone. She felt things slipping backwards. And then last August.</p><p begin="00:42:54.47" data-timestamp="2574.47">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:42:57.28" data-timestamp="2577.28">It was around 7:15 AM in the morning, and our driver came to pick me and my husband, and take us to work. As this was happening, all of a sudden, I heard one single gunshot. I opened the door. And the first thing I saw was our driver laying down on the ground, and he was clearly wounded. There was blood all over his arm, and it was all over his clothes, as well. But he just sort of waved toward me to go get back inside the house.</p><p begin="00:43:24.39" data-timestamp="2604.39">I called the head of the police. Nobody showed up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:43:30.68" data-timestamp="2610.68">The police didn't come until after the attack had completely ended. By that time, Hamida's bodyguard and driver were dead. She got lucky. The Taliban wanted to kill her.</p><p begin="00:43:41.20" data-timestamp="2621.2">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:43:43.01" data-timestamp="2623.01">In the past, when the Americans had a base in Ghazni, if an incident happened-- if something happened to me, or if I was having some problem-- I would call my female counterparts in the US military. They would ask me, oh, Hamida, how are you, my dear? Are you OK? Is everything OK? Do you need something? Now, that's not the case.</p><p begin="00:44:05.30" data-timestamp="2645.3">Although some of our friends tell us-- maybe, perhaps some of our American friends-- that we will never abandon Afghan's women. But there's also this other thing that their physical presence in Afghanistan-- that is, the American troops-- it was a huge support for us, for Afghanistan.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:44:31.52" data-timestamp="2671.52">The Taliban are now gaining more control in Ghazni. At this point in the withdrawal, the US is mostly focused on training Afghan police and other security forces on how to defeat them. Women's rights have dropped into the background, and more and more Afghan officials don't even give lip service to women's rights. Last year, they tried to pass a law that would have made it legal to stone a woman accused of adultery. A few months later, Parliament tried to make it tougher to prosecute rape cases.</p><p begin="00:44:58.35" data-timestamp="2698.35">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:45:00.88" data-timestamp="2700.88">The Afghan government, sort of, had this deal that they were going to be nice to women, just to sort of protect its own reputation. But now that the troops are leaving, perhaps, you know, that business deal doesn't hold anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:45:15.94" data-timestamp="2715.94">Hamida has a folder full of death threats from the Taliban. She's been shot at in a shopping mall. Her daughter was in a car chase on the highway. Hamida is always on edge and changes her house every six months.</p><p begin="00:45:26.78" data-timestamp="2726.78">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:45:29.29" data-timestamp="2729.29">Actually, the last threat that I received-- it was just four or five days ago-- and someone approached my driver and told him to tell me-- now the Americans are leaving, what are you going to do?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:45:45.31" data-timestamp="2745.31">Just to give you a sense of what Hamida is up against, the main people left in Ghazni to protect her-- the police-- are often the same people she's trying to prosecute. A United Nations report shows that 70% of Afghan female police officers have been sexually abused or harassed by male officers. One of her most disturbing cases recently involved a police officer kidnapping a 13-year-old girl named Nuria, then he gang-raped her with some of his colleagues.</p><p begin="00:46:11.70" data-timestamp="2771.7">Hamida said the girl's whole body was shaking uncontrollably when they met. Nuria decided to talk to local media. She wanted these guys arrested. So Hamida organized a press conference. She sat next to Nuria at a table set up with microphones and recorders.</p><p begin="00:46:26.55" data-timestamp="2786.55">[SPEAKING DARI]</p><p begin="00:46:31.13" data-timestamp="2791.13">Nuria tells them, I regained my consciousness around midnight. I saw three men, and I was completely naked. I tried to grab my clothes, but I fainted. These men violated me and kidnapped me, and I want the government to provide justice for me.</p><p begin="00:46:49.60" data-timestamp="2809.6"></p><p begin="00:46:51.02" data-timestamp="2811.02">How is she doing now?</p><p begin="00:46:52.43" data-timestamp="2812.43">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:46:53.75" data-timestamp="2813.75">She's missing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:46:55.70" data-timestamp="2815.7">She's missing?</p><p begin="00:46:56.27" data-timestamp="2816.27">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:46:57.86" data-timestamp="2817.86">Nobody knows what happened to her. She literally disappeared.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:47:01.28" data-timestamp="2821.28">You know who the police officers were, and nothing happened to them?</p><p begin="00:47:04.63" data-timestamp="2824.63">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:47:05.12" data-timestamp="2825.12">Yes. They're still police.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:47:10.97" data-timestamp="2830.97">Over the last year or so, the Taliban has ramped up its own campaign against women. They've killed at least six female police officers and other women, as well. Sometimes they videotape their murders. In one video, a woman named Najiba, who was accused of adultery, was shot 13 times, while men cheered in the background.</p><p begin="00:47:30.29" data-timestamp="2850.29">At the same time, Hamida says, she sees signs of progress in surprising places-- like she's getting a lot of phone calls these days from girls who've run away from home who need shelter. What's hopeful about this, she says, is that these girls have gotten a message-- that they have a choice, they don't have to put up with violence.</p><p begin="00:47:54.04" data-timestamp="2874.04">American officials are hoping Hamida can continue the mission she started even after their departure. One diplomat who's worked with Hamida is Karen Decker. She was the State Department's top official in eastern Afghanistan and used to fly over to Ghazni in a helicopter whenever she wanted to see Hamida.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen Decker</h4><p begin="00:48:10.87" data-timestamp="2890.87">I will worry about Afghan women. I worry about the fact that they still have a big fight ahead of them, and the bad times may last a long time. They've got to keep fighting. But it's going to be a hard fight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:48:25.24" data-timestamp="2905.24">Karen left her post in Afghanistan shortly after this interview. She'd been there for two years, going to some of the country's most dangerous districts, where some of her first questions were almost always about women-- could they vote, could they work, could they attend school? Regardless of the answers, she knew the US withdrawal had to continue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen Decker</h4><p begin="00:48:43.42" data-timestamp="2923.42">At a certain point, we had to step back, even from women that we knew were out there on the razor edge, trying to do good for Afghan women writ large. We still knew that for sustainable development, we could not continue to sit right next to them and enable their every movement, recognizing that it hurts. It hurts to see that. I think anyone would say the same thing. But we sort of steeled our resolve and said, we've got to stop. Because otherwise, we're going to have to be here forever. They will never stand on their own two feet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:49:21.42" data-timestamp="2961.42">When the US does leave, or as the withdrawal continues, what's the plan to continue supporting women like Hamida?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Karen Decker</h4><p begin="00:49:28.12" data-timestamp="2968.12">Well, a year ago, I banned the word "leaving" from the vocabulary of every American who worked for me, because we're not leaving. Our embassy is enduring. Our embassy is enormous. It has one of the largest development budgets in the world. I know what you mean when you ask the question-- and yes, everybody talks about us leaving-- but we're not leaving. We are just not going to be physically present in villages and provincial capitals, which is exactly the way we do business in most of the world.</p><p begin="00:49:58.78" data-timestamp="2998.78">Here's the thing, though-- every Afghan, including Hamida, has a cell phone. Access to the internet is growing. And we will communicate with people via all kinds of computer-based technologies-- Skype, we do a lot of Skype-- and Hamida is very well connected to us through those mechanisms.</p><p begin="00:50:23.20" data-timestamp="3023.2">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:50:24.25" data-timestamp="3024.25">I can't speak English.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:50:26.48" data-timestamp="3026.48">Hamida's internet connection isn't fast enough in Ghazni for Skype. She only speaks Dari. She says, sure, since the bases have closed in her area, American officials and soldiers still try to keep in touch. They send her email. She does understand a little bit of English, but it's not good enough to read those emails.</p><p begin="00:50:44.73" data-timestamp="3044.73">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:50:45.64" data-timestamp="3045.64">Sometimes I go, and I open my email, and I see there are, like, hundreds of messages from them. I just can't read them, so I just delete them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:50:58.53" data-timestamp="3058.53">For safety reasons, Hamida moved her kids out of Ghazni. She sent one to live in Pakistan and three to Kabul. Now, they act like they're the parents. They check in with Hamida frequently, ask how her day went, and just make sure she's OK. Sometimes her son, Solar, tries to stop her from going out on cases, especially at night. He's 13, and her youngest. I used the same interpreter for our interview.</p><p begin="00:51:22.84" data-timestamp="3082.84">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:51:25.33" data-timestamp="3085.33">At times, it hurts me so much that I want to scream about it. Especially at the times when she has made me mad, my mom, I fought with her. I have told her, please leave this thing, please be with us. This whole thing is not worth it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:51:42.07" data-timestamp="3102.07">It's not as clear for Hamida's daughter, Frohal. She admires her mom. She wants to be just like her, and she's as progressive as any woman I've met in Afghanistan. When I met her at her house, Frohal wasn't wearing a headscarf. She's a senior in college studying art. She likes sculpting nudes. In a few months, she'll graduate and move back to Ghazni to work with her mom. Frohal told me she recently asked her mom what happens to their family when the Americans are completely gone? Again, I used the same translator.</p><p begin="00:52:12.35" data-timestamp="3132.35">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:52:17.58" data-timestamp="3137.58">My mom would try to sort of tell me, look, you know, perhaps, we may have to leave at some point. But you know what, things are going to get better. But it's like this-- you've probably seen the pictures that my mom has of women being beheaded, and you know, women-- dead bodies. I've seen them, too. And so you know, for me, no matter how hard my mom tries sometimes to reassure us that everything's going to be all right, sometimes I don't know. You know, I don't think so. I think sometimes, perhaps after the Americans leave, we'll be the first victims for what our family has done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:53:03.23" data-timestamp="3183.23">Right now, when Hamida thinks about the future, she vacillates between two extremes. She can double down and run for Parliament next year. If she won a spot, she'd finally have some real power over Afghanistan's laws. But it would also make her an even bigger target for the Taliban.</p><p begin="00:53:19.22" data-timestamp="3199.22">Or she could openly admit to her American contacts that she needs help getting out of the country. Hamida keeps their business cards in a special drawer in her desk. She's already thinking about asking him for visas for her kids. We talked for hours before she told me this. She was embarrassed.</p><p begin="00:53:35.98" data-timestamp="3215.98">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:53:39.53" data-timestamp="3219.53">I've always told the media that I'm proud to be a woman. But I tell you this from the bottom of my heart-- that, I don't know. I just think, sometimes, I wish I was a man. In the end, we're viewed as troublemakers. In the end, the way they see us is that we're just creating problems.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:54:02.03" data-timestamp="3242.03">Does that ever make you want to quit?</p><p begin="00:54:04.24" data-timestamp="3244.24">[SPEAKING DARI]</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:54:07.73" data-timestamp="3247.73">Perhaps 1,000 times I think about it. To be honest, I'm very scared.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Kevin Sieff</h4><p begin="00:54:19.19" data-timestamp="3259.19">For now, though, in public, Hamida still plays the part of a confident Afghan woman. She wants women to feel like they still have an advocate. And so every time her cell phone rings, she takes the call, and when needed, heads out the door.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:39.94" data-timestamp="3279.94">Kevin Sieff is a foreign correspondent for <i>The</i> <i>Washington</i> <i>Post</i>.
