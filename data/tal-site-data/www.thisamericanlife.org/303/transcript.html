<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.34" data-timestamp="0.34">It's a classic David and Goliath situation. Younger sister and older sister. In this case, it's a big age gap. The older sister's 12. That's Kennedy. The younger sister's just 5. That's Zadie. And their mom, who was an only child, found their fighting to be kind of overwhelming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:00:16.11" data-timestamp="16.11">They bicker constantly. They just fight and are at each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zadie</h4><p begin="00:00:20.84" data-timestamp="20.84">[CRYING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kennedy</h4><p begin="00:00:22.12" data-timestamp="22.12">Z.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zadie</h4><p begin="00:00:23.06" data-timestamp="23.06">[CRYING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:00:26.52" data-timestamp="26.52">It's not physical, but it's a constant natter. It's a constant back-and-forth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:31.34" data-timestamp="31.34">So, two months ago, their mom, Lisa, came up with an idea, a way to change things between the two girls. She and I talked about it back then. You're going to notice in this recording that I have a pretty bad cold when we had this conversation.</p><p begin="00:00:43.51" data-timestamp="43.51">At the time, Lisa described for me the girls' history together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:00:46.89" data-timestamp="46.89">Once Zadie realized, when she was about two, that Kennedy wasn't going to play with her, she would do things like pinch her. She would scratch her. She would bite her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:55.40" data-timestamp="55.4">She wants her attention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:00:56.44" data-timestamp="56.44">Notice me, you know. I want to adore you. Let me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:01.06" data-timestamp="61.06"> Yeah. I have this relationship with my wife. We'll be sitting on the couch, and she'll hit me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:01:12.62" data-timestamp="72.62">Play with me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:15.08" data-timestamp="75.08"> Exactly. She'll literally say, pay attention to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zadie</h4><p begin="00:01:18.10" data-timestamp="78.1"> I like you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:01:20.81" data-timestamp="80.81"> Zadie, get up. Get off of Kennedy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zadie</h4><p begin="00:01:23.90" data-timestamp="83.9"> I like her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:01:25.80" data-timestamp="85.8"> Zadie, please get off.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Zadie</h4><p begin="00:01:28.17" data-timestamp="88.17"> I like her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:01:29.59" data-timestamp="89.59">Mute that for a second?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:01:31.74" data-timestamp="91.74">So as Zadie got older, Kennedy now sees her as this little kid who can't really play, who is a nuisance, who can pick out what's going to bug Kennedy and do it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:42.02" data-timestamp="102.02">And what was the low point of all this? When did you look around you and just think, What am I doing as a parent?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:01:48.46" data-timestamp="108.46"> I guess this summer, when they were both home from school and fighting all the time. And I just realized, it's not changing. And if it doesn't change now, it's not going to change. Because they're both getting-- I think Zadie's now getting old enough to form this opinion of her sister. And I thought, I don't want that opinion to be that they're not allies. I don't want it to be that they're not friends. Now's the time to do something.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:17.68" data-timestamp="137.68">And so what's your plan?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:02:20.55" data-timestamp="140.55">What we're going to do is this little experiment called the Kill Her With Kindness Experiment. I gave it a name.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:25.91" data-timestamp="145.91">So are you some sort of behavioral psychologist or something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:02:27.91" data-timestamp="147.91">Oh, God, no. No, I just went on the internet to junior high science experiments and got a whole bunch of stuff and presented it to Ken.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:38.21" data-timestamp="158.21"> Whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, you have the two people who are most precious to you in this world, and you have a problem, and the thought that occurs to you is not, I'm going to seek professional help. I'm going to go to a family counselor. No, what you did is that you went onto the internet and found experiments at a junior high school, not even at the high school level?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:03:03.01" data-timestamp="183.01"> No. OK, that's the end. That's not where I started. I read all the books, and I talked to all my friends.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:17.80" data-timestamp="197.8">When David is facing off against Goliath, nothing normal is going to work. Normal is just going to keep you stuck. If you've got a situation where one side is super-powerful, one side is very weak, normal is just status quo. Nothing is going to change. Your only chance is grand, extraordinary measures. A junior high school experiment? That is about as good as a slingshot. And today on our program, we're going to bring you three stories of people trying extraordinary things to balance the scales between David and Goliath.</p><p begin="00:03:46.80" data-timestamp="226.8">Act One is about a little girl and a big girl. Act Two is about a little country and a big country. Act Three is about some small-minded people and some very big-minded retail chains, and something about American commerce that happens all the time, everywhere, that no one has noticed is a national phenomenon except David Sedaris. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<div class="act" id="act1">
<h3>Act One: Lab Rugrats</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:12.37" data-timestamp="252.37">OK, so you remember where we are with Act One. You've got Zadie, you've got Kennedy, and their story. Their mom, two months ago, was explaining to me how she was going to try to solve one of the oldest struggles that humans have ever had, the struggle between big sibling and little sibling. Again, we've got a 12-year-old. We've got a 5-year-old. Two months ago, the mom, Lisa, went to the older girl, Kennedy, with a plan. And Kennedy is the kind of 12-year-old who loves reading, who loves science, who loves experiments. And Lisa explained the idea of this one to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:04:40.29" data-timestamp="280.29">We're going to have a month-long experiment where Kennedy is actually really kind to Zadie and plays with her. And we're going to see if that chills Zadie out at all. We're going to see if that changes Zadie's behavior. So the whole thing, I guess, has been sold to Kennedy as behavior modification.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:55.48" data-timestamp="295.48"> Wait, wait. Are those the words that you used with Kennedy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:04:59.01" data-timestamp="299.01">I did. I told her it was a behavior modification experiment. Yeah. How I see it as a parent is, I want them actually to interact with each other. But that's not what I sold to Kennedy. I haven't really sold it to her as modifying her behavior at all. I sold it solely as modifying Zadie's behavior.</p><p begin="00:05:17.55" data-timestamp="317.55">So this is going to cut Zadie down from irritating Kennedy, from being a pain to Kennedy, touching her stuff, going in her room when she doesn't want her to. If Kennedy's drawing on a piece of paper and Zadie comes by and will step on, like, that kind of behavior that Kennedy sees as an absolute pain. I've sold it to her as, Let's see if what Zadie actually wants is you to play with her and pay attention to her. So let's see if you doing that is going to stop all the negative behavior.</p><p begin="00:05:46.62" data-timestamp="346.62">So what she's going to have to do is, after school, spend-- I say an hour. She says that's going to be too long, and Zadie's not going to want to play for an hour. But that's what I'm envisioning, an hour playing together.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:58.45" data-timestamp="358.45">Every day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:05:59.51" data-timestamp="359.51">Every day. I'm going to pay her, which is probably what she likes the best.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:05.52" data-timestamp="365.52">How much is she going to get?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:06:08.71" data-timestamp="368.71">She's going to get quite a bit. She upped it. She actually negotiated her price. I said $50 for the whole month. And she said, No way. It wasn't worth buying in for $50. So she's going to get $100. But she's got to actually do it. She's got to actually play with her sister.</p><p begin="00:06:28.94" data-timestamp="388.94">And they think my idea of what siblings-- how they interact is totally unrealistic.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:33.59" data-timestamp="393.59">Because your ideal is based on?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:06:36.05" data-timestamp="396.05"> <i>The Sound</i> <i>of</i> <i>Music.</i> I mean, my ideal is that they get along, that they love each other, that they stand up for each other on the playground, that they--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:46.31" data-timestamp="406.31">--sing together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lisa Laborde</h4><p begin="00:06:46.97" data-timestamp="406.97">--sing together. Which is so funny, because that has a lot to do, probably, with being an only child and always wanting a sister or a brother or just a sibling, another relationship. I was raised watching that movie over and over, and really having that sense of all these kids band together. But, of course, they band together-- like, those poor kids, they're traumatized. Their father's a tyrant.

That certainly hasn't happened. I think she engages her a bit more, actually. So in terms of actually talking to her about, What was school like? What did you do? There were a couple of times where Zadie got quite upset over-- she got in trouble for going into Kennedy's room. And I got very upset with Zadie and made her sit on the stairs.

What if there were a battle between David and Goliath that meant a great deal to David and nothing at all to Goliath? And maybe Goliath doesn't even show up. From Cambodia, Rachel Louise Snyder tells this story about the garment industry there. We first put this on the air two years ago, which was a crucial turning point for everybody involved.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:19:51.19" data-timestamp="1191.19"> The garment industry is 90% of Cambodia's exports, so when the minister of commerce visits a factory, he's greeted like a movie star. Hundreds of workers, all of them women, stand along the factory driveway in traditional Cambodian silk dresses in maroon and gold, waving hundreds of Cambodian flags. They offer the minister flowers and fruit. As he walks through each section of the factory, workers stand up from their stations and cheer.</p><p begin="00:20:20.16" data-timestamp="1220.16">Plexiglass cases hang from the ceilings and show the kinds of things they make. Fleece sweatshirts, cotton blankets, flannel pajamas. The minister, Cham Prasidh, is particularly happy about the pajamas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cham Prasidh</h4><p begin="00:20:33.86" data-timestamp="1233.86"> There is one thing that we feel very proud, is that there is one year when Cambodia was ranking number one, in terms of pajamas, women's pajamas, for--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:20:46.26" data-timestamp="1246.26"> Women's pajamas?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cham Prasidh</h4><p begin="00:20:47.75" data-timestamp="1247.75"> Yes. That's when 20 million American women are wearing Cambodian pajamas. And we are ranking number one for that in the US. Sleeping soundly and having sweet dreams. We hope they would have us all thinking of Cambodians who are producing these for them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:21:07.66" data-timestamp="1267.66">They're not, of course. And that's Cambodia's entire problem in a nutshell. The clothing business has transformed Cambodia in a way most Americans can't imagine and know absolutely nothing about. In the 1970s, between one million and two million Cambodians died, about a third of the population, in the country's civil war. The Khmer Rouge eliminated business of every kind, and even money itself. The middle class was slaughtered. For two decades after that, the country's economy was flattened, and chronic drought affected hundreds of thousands of families.</p><p begin="00:21:41.09" data-timestamp="1301.09">But in the mid-'90s, outside investors began opening garment factories, and within five years, clothes were the country's biggest export. Two things made this possible. First, an international quota system implemented decades ago kept any one country from being the sole provider of clothes to the American and European markets. That meant more than 50 countries got a shot at the industry.</p><p begin="00:22:04.72" data-timestamp="1324.72">The second thing was that, under the Clinton administration, Cambodia was part of an extraordinary experiment. It got special access to US markets in exchange for good conditions for workers and factory monitoring by the International Labor Organization. The Cambodians didn't just make child labor and sweatshops illegal. They adopted some of the most progressive labor laws in the world. Eight-hour work days, paid overtime, three months' maternity leave, 43 days' vacation, annual health checkups, and free health clinics on site. The access Cambodia got to US and European markets made the industry explode, growing from nothing to 250 factories in just 10 years. The experiment was a huge success.</p><p begin="00:22:56.28" data-timestamp="1376.28">But as of January 1, 2005, both trade deals-- the quota system and the agreement with the Americans-- ended, and that's left Cambodia in a strange situation. It's the only poor country in the world that's agreed to all these strict labor laws. Left to the free market, it'll have to compete with neighbours like Thailand and Vietnam and industry mammoths like China and India. And so, the question facing Cambodia is, can a poor country survive if it treats its workers fairly? The minister sees the dangers as keenly as anyone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cham Prasidh</h4><p begin="00:23:29.13" data-timestamp="1409.13"> Because we were successful only in the garment sector so far, and we have not been able to diversify a lot, it's a kind of time bomb. And if you cannot defuse this time bomb, you're going to maybe explode in the future. If the garment sector does not survive in Cambodia, we are going to have a social crisis in Cambodia. Girls who came from the countryside to work in factories, if they lose their jobs, they would never return to their village. And you know what would be their fate. I don't want to elaborate on that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:24:09.11" data-timestamp="1449.11">What he doesn't want to elaborate on is that some of these women might turn to prostitution. Over a quarter million women work in the garment factories around Phnom Penh. They, in turn, support their entire families, often back in whatever village they came from. Minimum monthly wage is $45, and with overtime, most workers make $70 a month. That's two and three times what a police officer or teacher makes here. Garment workers send their brothers and their children to school, and subsidize farms that barely survive.</p><p begin="00:24:39.47" data-timestamp="1479.47">The good news is, so far, even with the trade deals expired, they've managed to stay afloat. None of the biggest buyers have left, and exports have even grown a little, 7% compared to last year. Though, in previous years, growth was more like 20%.</p><p begin="00:24:58.95" data-timestamp="1498.95">But since January 1, and the end of all their trade protections, Cambodian factories suddenly are being asked by their customers to lower costs and prices. Some factories have closed. Thousands of people have lost their jobs. Workers are getting less overtime and management is feeling the pinch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Voren Van</h4><p begin="00:25:16.30" data-timestamp="1516.3"> It's actually very worrying. Our cost is actually very high.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:25:24.15" data-timestamp="1524.15"> Voren Van runs a relatively small factory of 800 workers on the edge of Phnom Penh. They mostly make Levi's jeans. To hear Voren tell it, business is bad. Making clothes is more expensive in Cambodia than in most countries. Cambodia doesn't manufacture any of the materials it needs, so to create a pair of jeans, Voren has to import not only the fabric, but the thread, the zippers, the buttons, the rivets, everything. Then there's utilities. Voren says a recent study found that the cost of electricity is the same in Cambodia as it is in downtown Tokyo. And there's labor compliance, which is hugely expensive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voren Van</h4><p begin="00:26:03.24" data-timestamp="1563.24"> Just to give you an example, the cost of electricity that I'm paying every month is about $6,000. Now, if I do not bother about compliance, I will switch off the lights and my workers can sew in a dimmer light. And I can save maybe 20%. And that's a lot of money. And you're just talking about electricity. How about drinking water? If I don't give my workers proper drinking water, I can save $600 every month. If I employ, for example, kids under 16, I don't even have to give them anything. I just have to give them a bowl of rice and they will work for me. But, of course, I shouldn't do that. It's not right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:26:56.86" data-timestamp="1616.86"> To be clear, Voren's factory has a reputation for some of the best working conditions around. He believes in fair labor laws, that they're eventually going to transform society and the country by turning peasant farmers into an educated middle class. But doing the right thing, not dimming the lights, means Voren's only scratching by. And he's not the only one. The danger is that factories will pick up and move somewhere, like Vietnam. Voren says it's pretty easy. All you have to do is rent a space, ship your machines, and hire some workers. You can be running in two months.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voren Van</h4><p begin="00:27:30.80" data-timestamp="1650.8"> I can say that 70% of the factories here are struggling.

He's also the head of the Garment Manufacturers Association.</p><p begin="00:32:31.95" data-timestamp="1951.95">One morning, we meet for coffee at a hotel in Phnom Penh, just two days after a smarmy factory owner skipped town and blew off paying nearly 1,000 workers. Mr. Van was furiously text messaging, arranging to sell the company's assets, mostly sewing machines and chairs, to cover as much as he could of the lost wages.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Souieng Van</h4><p begin="00:32:50.83" data-timestamp="1970.83"> I feel I have a duty to do it, because the factory closed is a bad one. It is like a thief running away. And they don't even take care of the wages. But it's in everywhere, in all capitalists countries, even in the States. But in America, in other countries, citizens have money to survive for a few weeks, a few months. In Cambodia, they cannot survive without their wages for over seven days, 10 days. So they are hungry. They're hungry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:33:26.84" data-timestamp="2006.84">Mr. Van comes from a powerful family, and has the kind of money where he's imported a stable full of horses from France. He could be doing anything. But he happens to believe in what Cambodia's trying to do, and he considers it his duty to help save the garment industry. To do that, his days are crammed with meetings, often with the Factory Association's secretary general, Ken Loo, at his side.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Souieng Van</h4><p begin="00:33:48.53" data-timestamp="2028.53"> So, good morning, lady and gentlemen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:33:53.59" data-timestamp="2033.59">They're sitting at a table with two dozen Singaporean men and women in Western suits. Tropical fruit and bottles of water sit on three big trays in the middle of the table. The Singaporeans are all members of a manufacturing association, and they're on a fact-finding mission, looking for a new country where they can open up their businesses. They've also been to Vietnam on this trip, and Mr. Van and Ken want to do everything they can to persuade them Cambodia's the better choice. They have two days. Ken does most of the talking, and he starts with Cambodia's trump card, really the only thing they have to sell.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:34:27.55" data-timestamp="2067.55"> Cambodia has a good reputation with many international buyers, especially the big buyers that are concerned about their corporate image, concerned about corporate social responsibilities. And GAP has been our largest single buyer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:34:50.65" data-timestamp="2090.65">The GAP alone has 40 factories in the country, and constitutes 25% of Cambodia's entire clothing industry. Lots of other big names are here, too. It's weird to be sitting in a tiled conference room in Phnom Penh while vendors push wooden noodle carts outside, and hearing Asian executives recite every brand name you'd see in your local mall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:35:10.58" data-timestamp="2110.58"> Levi's, H&amp;M, Nike, Adidas, Reebok, all have indicated their intention to increase sourcing from Cambodia. Of course, Cambodia is not a panacea for production. We have our own internal problems, and these are the problems faced by all developing economies in the world, namely corruption, bureaucracy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:35:39.95" data-timestamp="2139.95">The Cambodians are amazingly frank about the problems of doing business in their country. The corruption is notorious, and pretty much everyone in the region, including the Singaporeans, knows it. And there's not much point pretending otherwise. Then there are the unions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:35:54.76" data-timestamp="2154.76"> Just to give you an idea, we have, at present, 223 garment factories.

An average of three unions per factory. Sometimes one group of workers in a factory will go on strike while the others work away at their posts. It makes negotiations totally unwieldy. Corrupt unions have extorted money from factory owners and other workers, and demanded ridiculous benefits. Owners already feel a number of the rules, based on French labor laws, are unfair.</p><p begin="00:36:37.01" data-timestamp="2197.01">In the meeting with the Singaporeans, for example, a lot of time was taken up with questions about breastfeeding breaks, which are required for new mothers. How do they happen? the Singaporeans wondered. Do the babies come to the factories? In Cambodia, working women leave their kids with family, so the breastfeeding thing is a logistical nightmare. There are a bunch of laws like this, headaches that are the cost of fair labor.</p><p begin="00:37:07.53" data-timestamp="2227.53">But Ken tells them these costs will all be worth it, and then he tells them Cambodia's new strategy to keep the country competitive. It's a bill before Congress-- the US Congress-- called the Trade Act of 2005. If it passes, Cambodia and a bunch of other poor countries would get tariff-free access to the US market. Right now, they're paying an average of 17%. Ken explains that Cambodia is asking for the tax break along with 13 other so-called least developed countries, or LDCs. They included Sri Lanka, hoping the tsunami there would earn the bill some sympathy votes. Ken and Mr. Van will be flying out to Washington to lobby for the bill in a week, and Ken lays out the pitch they're using with the American lawmakers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:37:49.22" data-timestamp="2269.22"> The angle is very logical. There are 50 LDCs in the world, five-zero. And the US has provided preferential access for 35 out of the 50 LDCs, basically in the sub-Saharan African region and the Caribbean and the South American. But 15 LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region have been left out. We are approaching the Americans, we are approaching the politicians, to say, Look, you have left us out. We are not asking for anything extra. We just want to be treated fairly as an LDC. You have given this to other LDCs. We feel it is fair you give the same treatment to us.</p><p begin="00:38:38.71" data-timestamp="2318.71">And we have gotten very good reactions. Some of the politicians were very surprised. Oh, really? 14 LDCs in Asia-Pacific were left out? Which includes a couple of countries that have a lot of interest in the House, namely Afghanistan. We have got very strong bipartisan sponsors of the bill, meaning we have got Republican and Democrat sponsors. For example, we just had-- what's-- Obama?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:39:18.59" data-timestamp="2358.59"> Barack Obama.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:39:20.07" data-timestamp="2360.07"> We just had Barack Obama sign on as a co-sponsor for our bill. Barack Obama is seen as the leader of the young generation of politicians in the US. We are also in the process of convincing Senator Clinton, because having her on board would be very influential, because she represents a lot of the female voice.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:39:45.30" data-timestamp="2385.3">This is what it's like to be the little guy up against the giant. You have to know everything about the giant, and the giant doesn't even know you're there. The Singaporeans ask for details about the bill, and the likelihood it will pass by the end of the year. They say the way Congress votes will sway their decision. The meeting adjourns.</p><p begin="00:40:04.38" data-timestamp="2404.38">What Mr. Van and Ken didn't tell the Singaporeans is that if the Trade Act doesn't pass, and soon, by the end of 2005 or the first few months of 2006, it might be too late anyway. At Mr. Van's factory, Voren says all it would take is two months without orders, and his factory and others would close.</p><p begin="00:40:30.45" data-timestamp="2430.45">In July, Commerce Minister Cham Prasidh, Mr. Van, and Ken flew to Washington, DC to lobby for the Trade Act of 2005. The trip had been planned months in advance, and they'd banked on the fact that CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, would be resolved by then. It wasn't. For two days, they lobbied any member of Congress who would see them, which turned out to be eight people. Mostly, when they heard the Cambodian story, they were sympathetic, and three of them signed onto the bill. But Ken says the congressmen were preoccupied with other issues.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:41:04.02" data-timestamp="2464.02"> They were all obsessed with CAFTA at the moment. And when we asked them whether they were ready to support the bill, they said, Not at this moment. This bill is not going to move unless we defeat CAFTA or unless we get CAFTA approved. So that was a bit disheartening.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:41:29.48" data-timestamp="2489.48">They'd also hoped to meet with President Bush, or at least someone from his administration. But the president was also preoccupied with CAFTA, and with his new Supreme Court nominee, John Roberts. Their previous trips had gone about the same. Their bill only has 25 sponsors, short of the 70 they ideally want, though this is way further than anybody thought they'd get.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Loo</h4><p begin="00:41:50.74" data-timestamp="2510.74"> Every single person we speak to tells us, Impossible. No chance in hell. When we speak to the US administration, when we speak to the US Embassy, they say, quote, "No chance in hell. You're not going to get it." But still, we commit our resources, we commit our time for this cause. And it's really a lot of money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:42:16.86" data-timestamp="2536.86">In Cambodia, the garment industry is front-page news every single day. Factories open or close. New brands come in or leave. Workers strike or lose their jobs. And while this bill means everything to the Cambodians, the sad fact is that Americans don't even know any of this is happening. Here's Commerce Minister Cham Prasidh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cham Prasidh</h4><p begin="00:42:37.19" data-timestamp="2557.19"> Actually, for me, when I go, I have the feeling that I'm coming like a beggar.

But, in fact, Cambodia's most vocal opponent of the Trade Act is a labor union, and the most dramatic moment of their trip to Washington came when the minister was speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And Mark Levinson, the chief economist for UNITE, the textile union, stood to argue with him.</p><p begin="00:43:29.81" data-timestamp="2609.81">Levinson said that since the US trade deal with Cambodia ended, workers' conditions have gotten progressively worse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Levinson</h4><p begin="00:43:36.46" data-timestamp="2616.46"> What we hear from workers in Cambodia is that since that link ended, there's backsliding in Cambodia. The situation is deteriorating in Cambodia, because the experiment, which was a success, is now over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:43:54.48" data-timestamp="2634.48">Here's where he's coming from. Even though conditions have improved for Cambodian workers when they're on the job on the factory floor, when workers hold demonstrations, even small ones of a dozen people or so, police come and run them off. There have been threats, intimidation, and beatings of union organizers by thugs trying to repress dissent. Two years ago, a wildly popular union leader was gunned down on a Sunday morning while he was reading the newspaper. Most everyone believes it was a political killing. 15,000 people attended his funeral.</p><p begin="00:44:27.20" data-timestamp="2667.2">But when Mark Levinson brings this up, it utterly galls the minister. From his point of view, established democracies like America don't have realistic expectations of brand-new democracies like Cambodia. A new country isn't going to solve all the corruption and civil rights abuses all at once. And without help like this trade bill, it'll just make the problems harder to solve, not easier.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cham Prasidh</h4><p begin="00:44:48.07" data-timestamp="2688.07"> You have to understand the context in which we are living. You know the history of Cambodia, but you have not known everything. We have gone through six successive political regimes in Cambodia within 30 years. People of my age, we saluted six different national flags of Cambodia. How many have you saluted so far? Only one. And through this type of conflict, genocide, and everything, we come out and try to find peace first.</p><p begin="00:45:24.03" data-timestamp="2724.03">We are all new. Six years ago, there is almost no unions in Cambodia. There are not unions in factories because there are no factories in Cambodia. We are all young. The workers are young, the unions are young, the factories [? are building, ?] the factory managers are new. And we have a system that is also new. We are open to democratization, but the question is that we need a kind of transition period where people mature in learning the laws, in abiding to the laws.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rachel Louise Snyder</h4><p begin="00:46:04.92" data-timestamp="2764.92">Before they leave DC, Mr. Van and Ken check out a few chain stores in Georgetown.

At The GAP, things seem more promising. Ken spots some familiar shirts on the table, striped ladies' tops he swears he's seen in Cambodia. But when they check the labels, they see Sri Lanka. Not only aren't they finding Cambodian products, they're finding stuff they could be making in Cambodia, stuff they want to be making. Mr. Van seems almost mystified by his country's lack of representation. He picks up a tiny pair of khaki pants at Baby GAP.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Souieng Van</h4><p begin="00:47:08.15" data-timestamp="2828.15"> We can do it better in Cambodia.

They spot a blue soccer jersey costing $50. Cambodia will get roughly $10, or a fifth of the selling price. The few other Cambodian-made garments they see are simple t-shirts or sweat tops, nothing more complex, like ornamental stitching that commands higher prices, the kinds of things that China, Vietnam, and Thailand do. All in all, pretty discouraging for them.</p><p begin="00:48:04.38" data-timestamp="2884.38">Cambodia is still a small, struggling player in the industry. And the way they see it, the success or failure of their experiment at fair labor practices is now in the hands of the US Congress. But the legislation that could help Cambodia, the Trade Act of 2005, doesn't stand any chance at all to make it to a vote in 2005. Mr. Van and Ken and the minister aren't giving up. They had scheduled another lobbying trip for October, but it was canceled at the last minute because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They haven't rescheduled yet. They're waiting for a time when US politicians can give them more attention. It's hard to imagine when that time will be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:51.69" data-timestamp="2931.69">Rachael Louise Snyder lives in Cambodia.

Lisa Pollak did reporting and recording for this story in Washington, DC.</p><p begin="00:49:04.72" data-timestamp="2944.72">It's been two years since we first broadcast that story, and the Trade Act of 2005, which Cambodians thought would save the clothing industry in their country, never got to the Senate floor. It was reintroduced this year, but is now currently sitting in committee. While the future of this particular act remains uncertain, the US has put limits on the amount of clothing that could be imported from China. Those limits on China will continue until 2008. Ken Loo says that Cambodia is likely to lose a fourth of their garment revenues if those limits are lifted.</p><p begin="00:49:35.25" data-timestamp="2975.25">For now, though, the Cambodians have actually done pretty well. Despite their fears, exports were up nearly 20% between 2005 and 2006, and they've remained up ever since, mostly because of companies like The GAP and Levi's, who want to buy from Cambodia because of their fair labor practices.</p><p begin="00:49:51.96" data-timestamp="2991.96">Cambodia continues to send their lobbying delegation to Washington, DC, hoping to get a version of the Trade Act passed, so they don't get creamed when Chinese quotas end.</p><p begin="00:50:00.79" data-timestamp="3000.79">[MUSIC - "SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE" BY MORRISSEY]</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Three: Adventures At Poo Corner</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:31.50" data-timestamp="3031.5">Act Three, Adventures at Poo Corner. Well, now we have this David and Goliath story, where the Goliaths are giant American retailers and the Davids are everyday people, a very particular kind of everyday people. This is a national phenomenon that David Sedaris noticed when he was out on the road.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:50:50.22" data-timestamp="3050.22"> A book tour allows one to travel the country and see almost none of it. The airport, the hotel, the store that's hosting you, that's usually the extent of it. But you do get to meet people and enjoy the sorts of exchanges you probably couldn't otherwise. Take this woman I met outside of Detroit, I think it was. We got to talking, and while signing her book, I learned that she worked at Target.</p><p begin="00:51:14.14" data-timestamp="3074.14">"Do a lot of people defecate in your store?" I asked.</p><p begin="00:51:17.65" data-timestamp="3077.65">And she placed her hand over mine, saying, "How did you know?"</p><p begin="00:51:22.12" data-timestamp="3082.12">"Well," I told her, "It's like this."</p><p begin="00:51:24.83" data-timestamp="3084.83">In my boyfriend Hugh's last year of high school, his family moved back to the United States and he got a job at a certain clothing store. OK, it was The GAP. Hugh got a job at The GAP. And on more than one occasion, a customer entered the dressing room and defecated on the floor. The carpeted floor, to be exact. He mentioned this about six months ago, and I was like, "We've been together for how long? And you're only telling me this now?" Because this kind of story is right up my alley. What kind of a person would defecate in The GAP?</p><p begin="00:52:04.20" data-timestamp="3124.2">It could be seen as a political statement, or an attempt to even some sort of a score, but that's probably giving credit where it's not due. There are bound to be exceptions, but from what I've gathered, the store itself is unimportant. In this woman's Target, people will crouch down in the middle of those circular clothing racks, do it right there with no door to hide them. In Pier 1, they'll just lean against the wall and lower their pants. The place is an outhouse, from what I've heard. So are Sears and Penny's. And this sort of thing has been going on for ages.</p><p begin="00:52:38.44" data-timestamp="3158.44">As an author on book tour, I believe it's my duty to spread pertinent information from one part of the country to another. Night after night, I addressed the subject of chain store defecation, and 97% of the audience would shake their heads, no. "You're putting me on," they'd say. "I don't believe it." The other 3% would nod, yes. And these were the ones who worked in retail.</p><p begin="00:53:02.21" data-timestamp="3182.21">One man that I spoke to stocks shelves at Kroger, and swore that it happens all the time. "In my case, it's mainly kids," he said, which is something I heard from quite a few people. Some poor four-year-old will ask to go to the bathroom, and the mother will point toward a dark corner of the shoe department or to a pyramid of canned pineapple. I guess they figure that, because it's a child, it doesn't really count. But I mean, come on, of course it counts.</p><p begin="00:53:34.79" data-timestamp="3214.79">In Chicago, I met a librarian who decorated her children's department with an elaborate cardboard castle, something she'd crafted by hand and painted to look like stone. The castle went up, and come the second day, what did she find lying just inside the drawbridge? A turd, that's what. Though, in this case, it was left by a teenager, who confessed after committing a similar crime in the elevator.</p><p begin="00:54:00.59" data-timestamp="3240.59">It's sort of a different category, but in Las Vegas, I spoke to a guy who worked for casino security that told me that people are so reluctant to leave a favorite slot machine that they'll often defecate in their pants. He orders them to leave, but instead of skulking out in shame, they'll put up a stink, or most of them will, saying they'll go back to their rooms when they're damn well ready. The nerve. I said to Hugh, "You'd expect that kind of behavior at the craps table. But slot machines?"</p><p begin="00:54:38.57" data-timestamp="3278.57">As my tour advanced, the stories got meaner and more senseless. I learned of a woman who'd entered the restroom of a bookstore and defecated into the center of the toilet paper roll, which is not one of those things you'd get right the first time. It would require a certain amount of practice, but practice where? When she had finished, the woman placed the roll back on its holder, which is inconsiderate, but not as inconsiderate as a college student who has taken to defecating into his dormitory's washing machines, the customer who defecates into the urinal of the delicatessen I heard about, or into the standing ashtrays of a once-grand hotel.</p><p begin="00:55:20.90" data-timestamp="3320.9">I'm guessing that most of these cases have to do with leaving your mark on the world, an impulse we all share on one level or another. Some shoot high, creating lasting works of art, and others-- well, who am I to judge? As a form of self-expression, defecating into a washing machine falls somewhere between scratching your initials into a bus window and setting fire to a trash can. Whatever notoriety there is to be gained is destined to be private, and hopefully short-lived. But that's what you get when you settle for number two.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:00.38" data-timestamp="3360.38">David Sedaris is the author, most recently, of the book <i>Dress</i> <i>Your</i> <i>Family</i> <i>in</i> <i>Corduroy</i> <i>and</i> <i>Denim</i>, and editor of the book, <i>Children</i> <i>Playing</i> <i>Before</i> <i>a</i> <i>Statue</i> <i>of</i> <i>Hercules.</i></p></div> </div>
