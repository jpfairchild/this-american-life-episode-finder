<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.02" data-timestamp="1.02">I've never been interested in William Burroughs. You know who this is? Beat writer, author of <i>Junkie</i> and <i>Naked</i> <i>Lunch</i>. To me, it's like he was somebody glorifying and fetishizing heroin. He was into grand pronouncements, like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:00:16.25" data-timestamp="16.25">Nobody seems to ask the question what words actually are and exactly their relationship to the human nervous system.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:26.31" data-timestamp="26.31">He just wasn't my thing. I didn't see what the big deal was. His ideas didn't seem interesting. I knew there were lots of really smart people who love him. I did not get it.</p><p begin="00:00:36.07" data-timestamp="36.07">And then I heard this radio documentary about him. And there's no other way to say this. I got it. I saw why people go nuts for him. The documentary was made last year to commemorate Burroughs' 100th birthday, commissioned by BBC Radio.</p><p begin="00:00:51.48" data-timestamp="51.48">And first of all, the sheer craft of this documentary was just a thing to behold-- finding people who knew Burroughs, and sorting through archival sound, and has this beautiful structure. But what really won me over is that it is not reverential about Burroughs. It thoroughly explains why he is such a mythic revered figure. But it doesn't buy into the myth.</p><p begin="00:01:13.85" data-timestamp="73.85">And they do this totally untraditional kind of narration where the rock star, Iggy Pop, who is apparently a huge Burroughs fan, both narrates the show and comments on the narration that the show producer has written to the show producer all through the show. I have never heard anything like it. It's one of the best hours of radio I heard last year, and one of the most original.</p><p begin="00:01:35.80" data-timestamp="95.8">Burroughs' 101st birthday is this week. And to commemorate it, I'm going to play you this documentary. OK? It's going to happen right now. So from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. And without further delay, I hand this over to producer Colin McNulty and his presenter. They're Brits. That's the word they use presenter, for the narrator. His presenter, Iggy Pop. Heads up, there are some impolite words in here and one racist term. If you're listening to this by podcast or over the internet, you will be hearing these words without beeps.</p><p begin="00:02:07.91" data-timestamp="127.91">And we've also included a few full sentences here with sexual content that had to be cut from the American broadcast of the episode. If you are somebody who prefers a less explicit version of the show-- maybe you have kids wandering in and out as you listen-- you can get that at our website, thisamericanlife.org. British radio, as you're about to hear, is more permissive than American radio when it comes to sexual content. Though they did begin their broadcast of the show with their version of a listener advisory, not like ours at all.</p></div> </div>

What are we doing?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:03:14.73" data-timestamp="194.73">This is William Burroughs' 100th birthday, and we are taking a look at his life, his times, and his work. I didn't write this stuff, but I'm willing to present. All right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:03:29.84" data-timestamp="209.84">That's fine, man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:03:30.60" data-timestamp="210.6">I will really hope you put that line in there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:03:33.72" data-timestamp="213.72">I didn't write this stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:03:34.63" data-timestamp="214.63">I'm not that close to the take of BBC4 or this whole thing. I'm going to be honest with you. Presenter? To me, I feel like I should have a little hat. Hey, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for star time? Ready to rumble. I could do those voices. At this particular time, we'd like to introduce the star of the show, Colin McNulty. All right, let's go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:04:06.19" data-timestamp="246.19">Let's do it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:04:07.11" data-timestamp="247.11">You ready?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:04:07.93" data-timestamp="247.93">I'm ready.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:04:11.21" data-timestamp="251.21">Now I've met William Burroughs once, and have been inspired by him, but I am not an expert on Burroughs, unlike this guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oliver Harris</h4><p begin="00:04:21.05" data-timestamp="261.05">I'm Oliver Harris. I'm a professor of American literature. I'm the author and editor of 10 books on or about William Burroughs. The strange thing is that a million people who never heard of William Burroughs can sing lines from <i>The</i> <i>Ticket</i> <i>That</i> <i>Exploded,</i> and that's because Burroughs' book is where Iggy Pop found the raw materials of <i>Lust</i> <i>for</i> <i>Life.</i></p><p begin="00:04:39.99" data-timestamp="279.99"></p><p begin="00:04:43.66" data-timestamp="283.66">It's where Johnny Ann comes from, along with those hypnotizing chickens and the flesh gimmick and the strip tease and the torture film. Pop responded to the way Burroughs was working back in the 1960s in a kind of montage way that we now take for granted in a digital era, but Burroughs was pioneering it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:05:06.60" data-timestamp="306.6">This is coming out of some <i>Lust</i> <i>for</i> <i>Life</i>, all right. He's not just in my music. Burroughs is everywhere. He's in Dylan's <i>Tombstone</i> <i>Blues.</i> He's on the cover of <i>Sergeant</i> <i>Pepper's</i> two rows behind Paul, right next to Marilyn Monroe.</p><p begin="00:05:29.28" data-timestamp="329.28">He inspired band names like the Soft Machine, a great band, and Steely Dan, which is named after a strap-on dildo in <i>Naked</i> <i>Lunch.</i> I didn't know that. The world was introduced to the phrase "heavy metal" in the book <i>Nova</i> <i>Express.</i></p><p begin="00:05:56.42" data-timestamp="356.42"></p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:05:59.81" data-timestamp="359.81">He worked with Kurt Cobain on a spoken word track, <i>The</i> <i>Priest,</i> <i>They</i> <i>Called</i> <i>Him.</i> Fight tuberculosis, folks. As Lou Reed said, without William, there is nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:06:16.17" data-timestamp="376.17">I am writing for people who are interested in exploring unexplored psychic areas.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:06:25.10" data-timestamp="385.1">This month, it has been 100 years since the birth of William Seward Burroughs II. By the time he died, the man left behind a humongous body of work. Bear with us. It's going to get weird. There will be drugs, sex, violence, aliens, the beats, of course, Tangiers, Paris, New York, and cats.</p><p begin="00:06:49.96" data-timestamp="409.96">We'll play around with cut ups too, but that will be explained. We've trawled through Burroughs' work and the archives, particularly <i>Burroughs,</i> <i>The</i> <i>Movie</i>, a film directed by Howard Brookner, which is being rereleased later this year. We've also spoken to many people that have been permanently touched by William Burroughs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Waters</h4><p begin="00:07:11.89" data-timestamp="431.89">I'm looking at my little collection here. I have the book <i>Queer</i> by William Burroughs. And it's autographed, "To John Waters, with admiration and friendship, William Burroughs, November 3, 1985 at the Mary Boone gallery."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:07:23.21" data-timestamp="443.21">Exhibit A, director John Waters. Burroughs gave him a name that stuck, The Pope of Trash.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Waters</h4><p begin="00:07:30.67" data-timestamp="450.67">Yes, I've been shamelessly milking that title, The Pope of Trash, for years. Matter of fact, as I'm sitting here, I'm wearing a long cloak to the floor and an imperial marjoram crown that says "The Pope of Trash" on it as we speak. But I grew up reading William Burroughs. I mean, I went to Catholic school and sat there and read <i>Junkie</i>, and the Christian brothers were so stupid, they had never heard of William Burroughs and thought, isn't it nice? He's reading. But they had no idea what I was reading.</p><p begin="00:07:57.29" data-timestamp="477.29">He was a role model for all of us. We all grew up reading him.

Little did I know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:46:47.13" data-timestamp="2807.13">James was William's manager for the rest of his life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Grauerholz</h4><p begin="00:46:50.07" data-timestamp="2810.07">I was his reader, his audience, the person who couldn't wait to see what he had written, to go over it with him, to discuss it with him, to bring him more things to write the next part of it. I was the one who cared what he had spent the day doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:47:04.44" data-timestamp="2824.44">Grauerholz organized public readings for Burroughs. The young punks crowded in to see their long lost crazy uncle. It all climaxed with the Nova Convention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:47:14.82" data-timestamp="2834.82">This is the Nova Convention. Welcome to the Nova Convention.

Keith Richards was supposed to be involved. Frank Zappa came to it. All sorts of people came.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:48:02.24" data-timestamp="2882.24">Just setting up for the great Frank Zappa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank Zappa</h4><p begin="00:48:09.10" data-timestamp="2889.1">Did I ever tell you about the man who taught his asshole to talk?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Waters</h4><p begin="00:48:12.96" data-timestamp="2892.96">William was one of the first people that ever branded himself, before there was such a word as that, by how he looked, how he talked, how he baited people. He was almost predictable in his macabre sense of humor. But it wasn't a lie. William really was like that. I mean, I think he was like that when nobody was there too. I don't think it was an act. But at the same time, he lent himself very well to fame.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:48:38.66" data-timestamp="2918.66">In 1981, William appeared on <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Live</i>, graciously introduced by the actress Lauren Hutton.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Hutton</h4><p begin="00:48:47.14" data-timestamp="2927.14">I'm very pleased tonight to introduce a man who, in my opinion, is the greatest living writer in America. In his first television appearance ever, here is Mr. William Burroughs.</p><p begin="00:48:59.47" data-timestamp="2939.47">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:49:03.15" data-timestamp="2943.15">Doctor Benway ships doctor drunkenly added two inches to a four inch incision with one stroke of his scalpel. "Perhaps the appendix is already out, doctor," the nurse said, peering dubiously over his shoulder. I saw a little scar. The appendix out? I'm taking the appendix out. What do you think I'm doing here? He lifts the abdominal wall and searches along the incision, dropping ashes from his cigarette.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:49:35.67" data-timestamp="2975.67">100 million views, laughter, respect, a literary halo.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:49:41.35" data-timestamp="2981.35">We're getting into the cat section. It's almost like, all right, we got to the point where Burroughs is at his height. It's almost like we should stop there, but we're not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:49:49.23" data-timestamp="2989.23">Oh, what haven't we covered yet? Hate. Cats.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:49:53.57" data-timestamp="2993.57">Right. We're getting into the cat section now. And the good news is, it's the last section.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:49:58.93" data-timestamp="2998.93">Evidence indicates that cats were first tamed in Egypt. The Egyptians stored grain, which attracted rodents, which attracted cats. I postulate that cats started as psychic companions, as familiars, and have never deviated from this function.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:50:20.78" data-timestamp="3020.78">Do you like cats?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:50:22.39" data-timestamp="3022.39">I do like cats. I feed so many cats that I'm a little bit pissed off at them right now because I spend a lot of time and money feeding them all the time. What they do, the way they get me to feed them, and my wife too-- I feed them here and in the islands. They just come and stare at you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:50:44.69" data-timestamp="3044.69">I find this desperate attempt to win a human protector deeply moving. The cat does not offer services. The cat offers itself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:50:58.72" data-timestamp="3058.72">He has this line where he just says, cats give you themselves.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Colin Mcnulty</h4><p begin="00:51:04.97" data-timestamp="3064.97">Yeah, I have that bit in there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:51:06.36" data-timestamp="3066.36">That's a deep line. In one of his last books, <i>The</i> <i>Cat</i> <i>Inside</i>, William writes about some of the many cats he owned, like Ruskie, Ginger, and Calico. Burroughs' young lover Marcus visited him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marcus Ewert</h4><p begin="00:51:21.04" data-timestamp="3081.04">I think he had at least six cats while I was there. And he had this one cat that would really pretty much hug you. It would stand up on your-- I've never seen a cat do this. If you're sitting on the sofa, it would stand up on its hind legs on your lap and put a paw, its front paws, one on either side of your head and just look right at you and press its head in close to you. It was the damnedest thing.</p><p begin="00:51:48.74" data-timestamp="3108.74">And William just loved his cats. I mean, he loved his cats so much. And I'm not trying to-- he loved people, too. But I think it was a much more scary and fraught and frightening thing for him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Iggy Pop</h4><p begin="00:52:09.55" data-timestamp="3129.55">Toward the end of his life, Burroughs became more concerned about the environment. It was like his childhood in Saint Louis was fading away, the old beautiful Midwestern America. William could feel the loss.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:52:24.47" data-timestamp="3144.47">The magical medium is being bulldozed away. No more green reindeer in Forest Park. The angels are leaving all of the alcoves everywhere as the forests fall to make way for motels and Hiltons and McDonald's. The whole magic universe is dying. The rain forests of Borneo and South America are going to make way for what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marcus Ewert</h4><p begin="00:52:56.55" data-timestamp="3176.55">I think he was a deeply sad person, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply sad person. So I think William did have this deep, deep, deep skepticism about people being able to connect. And I think specifically, people being able to connect with him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>William Burroughs</h4><p begin="00:53:13.27" data-timestamp="3193.27">There must have been a split between the cats who accepted domestication and those who did not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Grauerholz</h4><p begin="00:53:28.95" data-timestamp="3208.95">One day, one of his closest friends, Tom Peschio, went to see him at dinnertime, and William was having a coughing fit and had been having chest pains. And within a few minutes, Tom had convinced him to let Tom call 9-1-1, and me. He went to the hospital. He was not conversing. And then they got him stabilized. His eyes were open. He seemed to hear. But he wasn't speaking.</p><p begin="00:54:01.48" data-timestamp="3241.48">William had made a no extraordinary measures instruction. In other words, I'm going to say do not resuscitate. And William simply took his last breath. And that is how he died.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathleen Gray</h4><p begin="00:54:27.68" data-timestamp="3267.68">He was gentlemanly. He was an old school gentleman. He had manners. He loved to have friends around him. He loved to carry on. He loved to meet new people. He loved his fans. In the media, there is this other stereotypical presentation of who William Burroughs was, the guy in a three piece suit with a needle in his arm. But that's not the William I saw. That wasn't him. He was a very complex human.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ian Macfayden</h4><p begin="00:55:02.02" data-timestamp="3302.02">But none of this biographical stuff is of any interest apart from the actual writing. And what worries me in the centenary year is that everybody's talking about how they met Bill, and Bill said this, and Bill said that. Actually, no. I mean, people should really read the books.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allen Ginsberg</h4><p begin="00:55:24.29" data-timestamp="3324.29">He had this image, a kind of cold, blue, almost ray-like, almost alien image. And of course, he could be like that. He was like that in performances in public. It was his persona. But the real William Burroughs was just a wonderful gentleman and a great artist and a great friend. I miss him very much. I'm really glad to talk about him. It means a lot to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>James Grauerholz</h4><p begin="00:55:50.50" data-timestamp="3350.5">I miss him. I miss him.
