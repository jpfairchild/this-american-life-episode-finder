<h3>Act One: Duki</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.97" data-timestamp="0.97">We're in Danielle's house. Ever since she was a girl, when holidays dinners come they serve a meal that will probably look familiar to you. Picture, please, a main course, big platter, drumsticks, white breast meat, golden brown skin, stuffing and gravy and cranberry relish on the side. And in Danielle's family, they have a name for this meal that she told me on the phone recently. The name for this meal is--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:00:26.79" data-timestamp="26.79">Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:27.54" data-timestamp="27.54">Got that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:00:28.04" data-timestamp="28.04">Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:31.58" data-timestamp="31.58">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Special program today on the wonders of fish. All right, actually we can say the word here. And the word is poultry. And, as you probably know, each week on our program, we choose some theme, invite a variety of writers and performers and documentary producers to tackle that theme. And this week, as we, all of us, stand in that magical five-week period, that magical interregnum between the turkey of Thanksgiving and the turkey of Christmas, that magical five weeks where Americans consume nearly a fourth of all the turkey we consume over the course of the year, 67 million turkeys. So in this period, we bring you our annual Poultry Slam, stories about turkeys, chickens, ducks, fowl of all kind, and their mysterious hold over us.</p><p begin="00:01:41.88" data-timestamp="101.88">Well, I'm Ira Glass. Coming up in this hour, Act One, Duki.</p><p begin="00:01:45.95" data-timestamp="105.95">Act Two, Turkey.</p><p begin="00:01:47.36" data-timestamp="107.36">Act Three, writer David Sedaris.</p><p begin="00:01:53.53" data-timestamp="113.53">Act Four, South African Chicken Blood.</p><p begin="00:01:57.97" data-timestamp="117.97">And of course, what poultry-positive program would be complete without--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chickenman</h4><p begin="00:02:09.13" data-timestamp="129.13">Chickenman!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Women</h4><p begin="00:02:09.61" data-timestamp="129.61">He's everywhere! He's everywhere!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:13.43" data-timestamp="133.43">Yes, indeed, in the late 1960s, the winged warrior, Chickenman, struck terror in the hearts of evildoers on radios all across our great nation. And today, we are pleased to bring you the first new episode of <i>Chickenman</i> since 1969. This is one of those things if you have heard <i>Chickenman</i>, this needs no introduction. If you haven't, you are in for a big, big treat, a big radio treat. It's later in the show. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Five Preview: Chickenman</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:46.15" data-timestamp="166.15">Act One, Duki. So in Danielle's family, the power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:02:55.51" data-timestamp="175.51">Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:56.05" data-timestamp="176.05">That's right. And they call it that for a reason. And the reason has to do with a stuffed hand puppet called Duki. Now Danielle is nearly 30 years old. Her sister, Ashley, is two years younger. And Duki has been in the family since they were children.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:03:12.00" data-timestamp="192">Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about 8, and I was about 10. And when he first arrived, he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. And he had a cape on and black, villain slash hero goggles. He lost the outfit pretty quickly, and he went naked. And then he became Ashley's vehicle for torturing me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.95" data-timestamp="232.95">Now, it's not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle dominated Ashley. Ashley looked up to Danielle, fought to get her attention and her approval, and Danielle always, always got her way, except when Duki was around. Basically, Ashley would channel-- I mean the word is an anachronism in this context, but she would channel Duki. She should become Duki's voice. She would speak as Duki. And Duki was sarcastic. Duki was selfish and bossy. Duki would insult Danielle. Duki would tease Danielle. Duki would give her painful nose squeaks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:04:37.30" data-timestamp="277.3">Whenever Ashley brought Duki into the equation, he was completely the dominant force. I was just putty in Duki's hands.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:47.36" data-timestamp="287.36">Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley's personality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:04:53.80" data-timestamp="293.8">Ashley's very considerate and kind and thoughtful. And very, very sensitive to other people, very, very concerned about if other people are happy, and if someone else doesn't feel good. And Duki has this total, what's for lunch attitude. Like what's in it for me? In your face, totally out for himself, simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:24.69" data-timestamp="324.69">He's boastful and vain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:05:26.66" data-timestamp="326.66">He's just this indomitable spirit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:41.66" data-timestamp="341.66">Well, 19 years after Duki arrived in the Mattoon household, the fluffy whiteness is long gone. Fluffy, in fact, is not a word you would really use to describe Duki. Nor is two-eyed, if I remember correctly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:05:55.28" data-timestamp="355.28">What he looks like physically is just-- he's a slightly pathetic looking, gray, tattered thing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:04.07" data-timestamp="364.07">Very tattered.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:06:04.50" data-timestamp="364.5">Very tattered. But then the fact that his brain, what's coming out of his mouth, is in complete denial about who he actually is-- I don't know. There's just something really, really great about that. And really, you have to love him for it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:30.57" data-timestamp="390.57">All right, I've been at Danielle's apartment sometimes, and I've witnessed the following scene. Picture, please. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks. She picks up the phone, calls Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, "Can you put Duki on?" And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the phone. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied. These are adults. Danielle is an editor at a big New York magazine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:13.80" data-timestamp="433.8">I adore Duki. I really love Duki. And sometimes, I think if he disappeared, it would really feel like someone died. I mean, I look at him, and he looks really old and ratty, and it really makes me sad. I mean, it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki in it. There would be a big, empty hole in the world. He takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:02.03" data-timestamp="482.03">So I hope it's becoming clear why, if you eat dinner in the home of Danielle's family, if they're serving some kind of poultry, chicken or turkey, if you were to ask anybody in the family what's for dinner, they'll tell you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:08:14.19" data-timestamp="494.19">Fish.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:14.68" data-timestamp="494.68">Right. And the rationale for that is what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:08:18.79" data-timestamp="498.79">It freaks Duki out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:20.09" data-timestamp="500.09">It freaks him out-- you don't like him to know that perhaps some birds are in fact eaten?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:08:25.97" data-timestamp="505.97">I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. He's in denial about most things. He's in denial about the fact that he's totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good-looking and strong and that he's really smart and has a lot of friends.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:42.93" data-timestamp="522.93">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:08:45.77" data-timestamp="525.77">He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him that. I say, "Duki, give me a break. You're just stuffed." And he's like, "No way."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:08.00" data-timestamp="548">Now, I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this program. So I contacted Danielle's sister, Ashley, and asked her, "Could Duki come on the air?" I received an answer back, not by phone, but by electronic mail, that for Duki to appear, I'd have to first go through someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mother. And when I talked to Danielle, I asked her about this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:35.24" data-timestamp="575.24">I've been informed that the only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu. Do I have that name right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:09:42.50" data-timestamp="582.5">Yona Lu, yeah.

Three times, by the way, that's three times the number in the public radio network. According to the people who syndicate <i>Chickenman,</i> it has been translated into German, into Dutch, into Swedish. It is still on the air, they say, in several dozen markets, making it one of the longest running radio features anywhere. <i>Chickenman.</i> <i>Chickenman</i> existed years before National Public Radio existed as a national network. <i>Chickenman</i> will continue probably years after we're all gone like the mighty cockroach, like-- I don't know-- like the bagel, like [UNINTELLIGIBLE] <i>Chickenman</i> endures, will endure.</p><p begin="00:20:03.64" data-timestamp="1203.64">Well, coming up later in the program, we'll have the first new real <i>Chicken</i> episode since 1969, written especially for <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> by Dick Orkin, the voice of <i>Chickenman.</i> But first, before that, let's hear what all the fuss was about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chickenman Announcer</h4><p begin="00:20:22.13" data-timestamp="1222.13">Now another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crime fighter the world has ever known, Chickenman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Women</h4><p begin="00:20:34.99" data-timestamp="1234.99">He's everywhere!

<h3>Act Two: Turkey</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:03.32" data-timestamp="1623.32">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a topic, bring you documentaries, short fiction, found tape, anything we can think OF on that theme. Theme today, with the turkey of Thanksgiving just behind us, the turkey of Christmas ahead of us, we're in that turkey sandwich part of the year. And we are in the middle of it. We are at the center of that sandwich. And in honor of that, we're holding our annual poultry slam here on <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. This next story is from Julie Showalter, who grew up on a turkey farm in Missouri.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Julie Showalter</h4><p begin="00:27:39.15" data-timestamp="1659.15">The day before the night 3,000 thousand turkeys died, we moved 13,000 turkeys to the range. This requires some explanation. Turkeys spend their first 16 weeks in a heated brooder house. Then, they are put outside to range in fenced enclosures. Usually, men in trucks come and take them to the range at night. This time, daddy decided we'd herd them ourselves.</p><p begin="00:28:12.32" data-timestamp="1692.32">It looked simple enough. We made a temporary chute of wire fencing that ran from the double-end doors of the brooder house 50 yards to the pen. We would get behind the turkeys in the brooder house, shout, wave old shirts and gunny sacks at them, and they would run out the doors, through the chute and into the pen. And that's the way it worked in the first brooder house. The first turkeys hesitated at the door, walked out cautiously, then moved through the chute and dispersed. The rest followed. It took about an hour. Daddy was pleased. "Let's work straight through, he said. "We'll be done by 10:00."</p><p begin="00:28:58.83" data-timestamp="1738.83">By the time turkeys have been in a brooder house for 16 weeks, the air is filled with ammonia, feather particles and dust. The stench is overwhelming. After an hour in the brooder house, your lungs hurt for a day. You can contract disabling lung diseases from working only a week in a poultry house. Tiny barbed pieces of feather dig into the tissue of your lung and never let go. But we didn't know that then.</p><p begin="00:29:31.58" data-timestamp="1771.58">We moved the temporary fence to the doors of the second brooder house. When we threw open the doors at the end of the second house, it was 9:00 in the morning. The sun streamed in the open doors on turkeys that had never seen direct sunlight. The one thing you can count on with turkeys is that you never know how they are going to react. I've seen turkeys clamor against a fence trying to get into a range fire. I've seen them rush toward a screaming child trying to kill it, and I've seen them run from a screaming child spooked and terrified.</p><p begin="00:30:08.66" data-timestamp="1808.66">These turkeys didn't want to go into the sun. As we pushed from behind, they compacted. It was like an old adventure movie where the walls are closing in, but there was no wall at the end, only a patch of sunlight, which the turkeys would not touch. We yelled louder, waved our cloths, kicked at the ones in the rear. Finally, Daddy walked through the solid carpet of turkeys to break the logjam at the front. He stood at the edge of the sunlight, lifting the turkeys three or four at a time with his feet, stirring them with his legs, forcing them into the sun.</p><p begin="00:30:49.90" data-timestamp="1849.9">Suddenly, they broke free. As stubbornly as they had refused to go into the light, they now rushed toward it. They ran in a panic, piling on top of each other, knocking down the temporary fence. By the time daddy could get the doors closed, at least 1,000 turkeys had escaped and were running free on the farm, onto our neighbor's farm, into the road.</p><p begin="00:31:21.96" data-timestamp="1881.96">We didn't own the turkeys. We raised them for a company that owned the hatchery, the feed mill, the fleet of trucks that delivered and loaded the turkeys, the processing plant. We got a portion of the profits, if there were profits. With 1,000 turkeys gone, there would be no profits on this flock. 16 weeks of daddy working 14-hour days, of my sisters and me working alongside him anytime we weren't in school, all for no pay. And if we weren't paid for this flock, we would have no cash coming in until the next flock was raised.</p><p begin="00:32:02.68" data-timestamp="1922.68">It took us eight hours to round up the escaped turkeys, four of us trying to track down 1,000 birds that had the whole world in which to hide and run from us. The sun beat down, and the air was thick and humid. We stopped once for water, and my sister Billie, the youngest of us, just 11, vomited from the cold water hitting her stomach after hours of sun, heat, and dehydration. As she lay on the ground, shaking and holding her stomach, I hated her for being the one too sick to continue. But even she was not too sick. We all went on. She got an extra five minutes to rest, but we all went on.</p><p begin="00:32:50.54" data-timestamp="1970.54">You may be asking right now how my father could be so cruel, how he could work young girls like that. Or you may think I'm exaggerating, that self-pity has magnified our distress. I tell you, this is no exaggeration. And I tell you, my father had no choice. Or any choice he had was so far in the past that there was no unraveling it. Years later, when we were grown, we caught a glimpse of his guilt, his bitterness over what he had done to us. "I couldn't afford niggers," he told my sister Billie, "so I had daughters."</p><p begin="00:33:33.81" data-timestamp="2013.81">At 6 o'clock, we rebuilt the chute. We opened the doors, and the 6,000 remaining turkeys, the sun now low behind them, walked through to the pen. We cleaned up, we ate supper, and we went to bed. That's the day we had before the night 3,000 turkeys died. At midnight, mother woke us up. "We have to get to the pen. Daddy needs us." We had been too exhausted to hear the storm. We ran out in the driving rain. Flashes of lightning showed daddy picking up turkeys and throwing them one after the other.</p><p begin="00:34:16.04" data-timestamp="2056.04">When people learn I grew up on a turkey farm, they invariably ask, "Is it true? Are they really so stupid that they open their mouths in the rain, look up at the sky, and drown?" The answer is yes. Some of them do that. They are that stupid. But that's not how 3,000 die in one night. They die because they are scared, and they huddle together in their fear. They climb on top of each other trying to get close, to find protection in the mass of bodies. And they suffocate. We called it piling.</p><p begin="00:34:58.76" data-timestamp="2098.76">It wasn't unusual for a loud noise to cause a pile in the brooder house. If there wasn't someone to pull them off each other, 50 could die because someone slammed a door. But this was worse than any pile we'd seen. Turkeys who'd never spent a night outdoors, panicked by thunder and lightning and rain in sheets. All we could do was pull them out of the pile and throw them away from it. They would run back, still seeking the comfort of the group. After a while, standing in mud, grabbing soaked turkeys, throwing them, grabbing some more, you don't know if the ones you are throwing are dead or alive. You don't care. Maybe we saved some.</p><p begin="00:35:43.43" data-timestamp="2143.43">The next day, the sky was cloudless, and the sun bore down on us again. We picked up dead turkeys, throwing them onto the back of a flatbed truck. Daddy drove the truck into a field far from the house. 3,000 dead turkeys sitting in the Missouri sun for two days. The company that owned the turkeys had them insured against acts of God, so we couldn't do anything until the insurance inspector had seen them. He came, a man from town in a white shirt and tie who held his handkerchief over his face when he got close to the truck. He made no pretense of counting, just stood there gagging.</p><p begin="00:36:31.76" data-timestamp="2191.76">After he left, Daddy shoveled the turkeys into Dead Turkey Gulch. He poured gasoline on them and struck a match. They burned for days.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:47.16" data-timestamp="2207.16">Julie Showalter lives in the Chicago area.

It's an excerpt from his diaries.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:37:42.44" data-timestamp="2262.44">July 19, 1992. This afternoon at the 26th Street flea market, I had one of those experiences that remind me why I shop in the first place. Not shop like grocery shop, but step out into the world searching for that one thing I cannot name. I pass the usual objects, the grinning mammies offering themselves up as salt and pepper shakers, the coffee table made from dice, another head carved from a coconut. "That's collectible," the dealers say, referring to an ashtray in the shape of a doll-sized toilet bowl. Collectible to who?</p><p begin="00:38:20.43" data-timestamp="2300.43">Last weekend at the flea market, I saw this thing, a taxidermy turkey's head attached to its own foot. This turkey was equipped with that length of flesh that spills from the top of its beak and fell to its neck. Stiff red hair stood out from the head and shoulders, and the claws were really sharp. You'd think that something armed like that might be able to protect itself. I pictured its maker standing by a chopping block saying, "I know. I'll take the turkey's head and attach it to the foot." Why would you do that? And more importantly, what sort of life would you lead that might enable you to make this connection?</p><p begin="00:39:03.24" data-timestamp="2343.24">I was hypnotized by this object and asked the price as if I were under a spell. "$45," the dealer said. My tongue was dry from hanging in the open air, and I tried to fit it back into my mouth. "All right," she said, "35, 30." But she could have gone up. "All right, 85, 120, 370." I had no choice but to follow wherever she led me. I handed over my wallet in a trance, just gave it to her, thinking she could take the whole thing, the cash, blank checks, library card, whatever. Take it all. I stared into the face of this taxidermied turkey's head and nothing else mattered.</p><p begin="00:39:43.26" data-timestamp="2383.26">Tomorrow, what's that? Yesterday doesn't count. My life began the moment I could call this thing my own. On the way home, I felt giddy and confident that I could approach anyone at all and say, "I'll give you 100, no $500,000 if you can guess what I've got in this paper sack." And I swear that not one of them could have come up with the right answer. I walked home 30 blocks, looking everyone square in the eye and thinking, "Sucker."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:14.37" data-timestamp="2414.37">David Sedaris lives in New York City.

Listen, about the item that we spoke about, the turkey's head attached to the turkey's foot, well, I spoke to some sangomas, which are witch doctors in the neighborhood about that thing. And they've never heard of anything quite like it or seen anything quite like it. However, when I would describe it to them, their jaws dropped. But look, I discovered a whole bunch about poultry in South Africa, so call me back, OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:22.46" data-timestamp="2482.46">Well, Michael is Michael Stumm, performer, actor, former member of The Wooster Group in New York City. A former Chicagoan, now lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. And I asked him to look into the uses of chicken and other poultry among the sangoma culture in South Africa. Sangomas, or witch doctors or herbalists or orators, you hear them called sometimes, they're common in South Africa. Everybody seems to know one. And chickens are one of their main tools.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Stumm</h4><p begin="00:41:51.11" data-timestamp="2511.11">Well, it's a funny thing. I've discovered that over half the country is just awash in chicken blood. It's a substance that comes in so handy. It's rather like-- gosh, I don't know-- it flows like milk does in America or Dr. Bronner's chamomile soap or some other easily spilled liquid in modern America. It's an incredibly versatile product. You can lose bad luck with it. You can strengthen a faulty muscle with it. You can improve your eyesight with it. You can find lost items with it. You can get your wife back with it. You can transfer your bad luck to someone else with it.</p><p begin="00:42:36.40" data-timestamp="2556.4">I mean, I had someone tell me that there is a ceremony involving the killing of a chicken in a rather baroque manner, which I'll describe to you. But this is a very specific ceremony that involved losing your court papers at court.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:51.34" data-timestamp="2571.34">In other words, if you do this thing with this chicken, the court will lose the papers, and that's how you will go free?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Stumm</h4><p begin="00:42:57.58" data-timestamp="2577.58">Allow me to describe the ceremony.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:59.73" data-timestamp="2579.73">Sure, because I'm sure many of our listeners get into these kinds of situations and have wondered, how can we make, for example, the US District Attorney simply lose that file?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Stumm</h4><p begin="00:43:08.72" data-timestamp="2588.72">Yeah, you are arrested. A court date is set. You then go home to your witch doctor. You bring him a white chicken. It has to be a white chicken. The witch doctor then prescribes some muti, which is medicine. It can come in many, many forms. Perhaps it's a powder. Perhaps it's a liquid. It doesn't really matter because you're going to take the muti yourself. You then take the chicken and the muti to the nearest mountain. You climb to the top of the mountain. You dig a hole. You dig a hole large enough for the chicken to fit in. You then speak to the chicken. You say to the chicken, "This is what I want to have happen. I would like my United States federal court tax document, file number 869102b, to disappear." Or whatever it is that you want to disappear.</p><p begin="00:43:56.93" data-timestamp="2636.93">You then take a large sewing needle, and you poke the chicken's eyes out with this sewing needle. You then bury the chicken, the now blind chicken, alive in the hole. You put him in the hole. You put the dirt back on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:09.81" data-timestamp="2649.81">Then this chicken is going to do something for you in the afterworld after you've poked out its eyes and you're burying it alive?

What can I say? Essentially, it's the end of the ceremony. You leave the chicken, and then you go. And as it was described to me, you go back to your court date on the day of your court date, and your papers will be lost. People will say to you, "You have no papers. You are free."

But you rustle a chicken, I mean, the word rustle doesn't even seem like it's the right word. It's just too big a word. It's too grand a word. You don't hear the strands of Aaron Copland when the word rustle comes up next to the word chicken. Hold on for a second. I'm just going to put on some Aaron Copland here right now. I just wanted you to conjure a scene of the chicken rustlers. Could you just describe how you picture them? The music is going now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Michael Stumm</h4><p begin="00:46:05.28" data-timestamp="2765.28">Well, I think as I picture a chicken rustle, they probably wait until the sun goes down. And they probably have a sack, because if you stick a chicken in a sack, she is not going to make noise. So they probably chuck a bunch of chickens in the sack, as many as they can get away with until the chickens who are not in the sack start making noise. And then they run away. That's how I envision a chicken rustling.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:43.48" data-timestamp="2803.48">Michael, do chicken rustlers ever get rustled themselves?

<h3>Act Five: Chickenman, Like The Phoenix</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:30.89" data-timestamp="2910.89">Act Five, <i>Chickenman,</i> Like the Phoenix. As a child, I did not care about the radio. In fact, I have to say that there was only one thing that I remember hearing on the radio up until the age of 16, I'd say. And that was <i>Chickenman.</i> It had all these qualities of radio that I've since come to value. It was surprising. It was funny. It had its own sound, a sound that was completely distinctive and instantly recognizable and appealing. Dick Orkin was the voice of <i>Chickenman,</i> and in the years since <i>Chickenman,</i> he's done tons of work, including lots of commercials in that deadpan style, a style which hundreds of people all over the country have tried to imitate. Nobody ever gets it right.</p><p begin="00:49:17.36" data-timestamp="2957.36">And it's a pleasure, it's an honor to have him on our program. Last year when <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> was just a local program in Chicago, before you could hear it around the country, we invited Dick Orkin to create a new <i>Chickenman</i> episode for our Poultry Slam. And he put a cast together, put together the first new episode since 1969. In this episode, Chickenman is a quarter century older, like his creator, and he faces a new set of problems.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chickenman Announcer</h4><p begin="00:49:43.59" data-timestamp="2983.59">Now, another exciting episode in the life of the most fantastic crime fighter the world has ever known, Chickenman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Women</h4><p begin="00:49:56.02" data-timestamp="2996.02">He's everywhere!

I didn't want to be late since it was my first in 30 years. 9:50 AM. I get a flat as I pull the chicken Coupe out of the chicken garage. So I take the convenient number 32 bus, which drops me off only 14 blocks from the doctor's office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Doctor</h4><p begin="00:50:21.20" data-timestamp="3021.2">You're late.
