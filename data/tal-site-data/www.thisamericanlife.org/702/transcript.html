<h3>Prologue: Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:01.06" data-timestamp="1.06"> Andrew Thomas Norway lives in St. Paul, but he's one of those doctors and nurses who flew to New York to help with flood of COVID patients who filled New York hospitals. He's actually at the hospital at Columbia University, where he went to medical school a quarter century ago. At night, after his 12-hour shifts, he sleeps in his old dormitory, literally in the dorm room he had when he was 23. The hospital has scratched out all kinds of extra space for COVID patients, converting 24 operating rooms into intensive care units. But the strangest thing to him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Thomas</h4><p begin="00:00:29.20" data-timestamp="29.2"> Normally, there'd be family all over the place. But the families are not able to come close to the hospital. They can't even come in the lobby, let alone get to see the people they love. And the other thing is just the reality that most of these people are going to die in these places alone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:47.71" data-timestamp="47.71"> Most of them are unconscious, in medically-induced comas, because it's easier to survive on a ventilator that way. But because they're unconscious, it means that the gap between these COVID patients and their families is even more profound, because they don't talk on the phone or FaceTime or anything. So Andrew suggested to the nurses that maybe they should take notes each day, little things they notice about each patient to share with the families if the patient dies. I asked him to read a few.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Thomas</h4><p begin="00:01:11.98" data-timestamp="71.98"> Sure. This one's from a nurse named Sandy. And she wrote, Mrs-- I won't say the name. "The patient is mostly sleeping. She looks peaceful. Also, I really like her dark green fingernail polish. I would love to know the name of the color."</p><p begin="00:01:33.73" data-timestamp="93.73">Here's another one. "I've been parting the patient's hair to the side. I don't know if that's how he wears it, but I think it looks good that way. Also, yesterday he got a shave, and now he looks so young."</p><p begin="00:01:50.81" data-timestamp="110.81">Here's one more. "The patient looks so peaceful. He's sleeping and calm. Everyone is jealous of his salt and pepper hair. He looks like George Clooney right now."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:03.75" data-timestamp="123.75"> I talked to a few of the nurses who are writing these notes, and they said that, because the patients are unconscious, their interactions are pretty basic, so figuring out what to write can be tricky. Dr. Thomas sees that for sure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Thomas</h4><p begin="00:02:15.19" data-timestamp="135.19"> Yeah, so people end up focusing on what you can see, which is embellishments like earrings and hairstyles and fingernail polish, and also just trying to emphasize that the people are comfortable, that they're sleeping. They're not in pain. That's something we really want to-- almost all the nurses comment on that, it seems, on almost every one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:40.98" data-timestamp="160.98"> And what's your hope about how the families will take this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Thomas</h4><p begin="00:02:45.00" data-timestamp="165"> My hope is that the families will know that their loved ones were being seen as people and treated as people, and that they weren't alone as this happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:04.52" data-timestamp="184.52"> So they gather details about the people laying in front of them, knowing that there's something like an 80% chance that, if they're on a ventilator with COVID, they won't live. Those are the numbers in New York. Those two things are so different in size, writing down a few tiny observations measured against the enormity of death and what that means. But sometimes, I think that's all you can do. And today on our program, we have two stories where ordinary people rise to this exact task. They look at death standing there-- gigantic, horrifying-- and they say something. And in these stories, truly amazing things happen. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: Really Long Distance</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:57.96" data-timestamp="237.96"> Act One, Really Long Distance. So remember that tsunami that hit Japan? March 2011, giant black waves more than 30 feet tall hit Japan. A guy in a little town called Otsuchi shot this video. You can hear him yelling. All the houses are washing away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:04:15.47" data-timestamp="255.47"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:17.95" data-timestamp="257.95"> Otsuchi had been there for 100 years, and in 30 minutes, it was gone, almost totally flattened. The tsunami and the earthquake that went with it killed six times more people than died in 9/11, over 19,000 people. Another 2,500 are still missing. In the aftermath, of course, families struggled to figure out how they were going to move forward without the people they loved.</p><p begin="00:04:39.20" data-timestamp="279.2">And in that town of Otsuchi, it led to this new-- I don't know, ritual is not exactly the right word for this, but it's something close to that-- this thing that people invented to stay connected to the dead. One of our producers, Miki Meek, has family in Japan, and she grew up going back and forth between there and here. And she watched this documentary about this thing people were doing in Otsuchi on the Japanese News Channel NHK, and got permission for us to play you some excerpts. Here's Miki.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:05:04.58" data-timestamp="304.58"> Of all the areas in Japan affected by the tsunami, Otsuchi has one of the highest numbers of missing people, 421. Today, it's still partly in ruins, and partly a construction site, as they try to rebuild the town on higher ground. But a year before the tsunami happened, this guy named Itaru Sasaki, he was already dealing with a loss. His cousin had just died, and Itaru was having a hard time figuring out how to talk about it.</p><p begin="00:05:31.67" data-timestamp="331.67">So he did something pretty ingenious. He went out and bought an old-fashioned phone booth and stuck it in his garden. It looks like an old English-style one. It's square and painted white, and has these glass window panes. Inside is a black rotary phone rusting on a wood shelf. This phone connected to nowhere. It didn't work at all. But that didn't matter to Itaru. He just needed a place where he felt like he could talk to his cousin, a place where he could air out his grief. And so putting an old phone booth in his garden, which sits on this little windy hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, it felt like a perfect solution.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Itaru Sasaki</h4><p begin="00:06:07.22" data-timestamp="367.22"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p><p begin="00:06:09.72" data-timestamp="369.72"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:06:12.27" data-timestamp="372.27"> He's saying, because my thoughts could not be relayed over a regular phone line, I wanted them to be carried on the wind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Itaru Sasaki</h4><p begin="00:06:18.85" data-timestamp="378.85"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:06:21.35" data-timestamp="381.35"> So I named it the Wind Telephone, [JAPANESE]. The idea of keeping up a relationship with the dead is not such a strange one in Japan. The line between our world and their world is thin. Lots of families keep a Buddhist altar for their dead relatives in the living room. My uncle has one for our family. There are photos on a little platform, and every day he leaves fresh fruit and rice for them, lights incense, and rings a bell. It's a way to stay in touch, to let them know that there's still a big part of our family.</p><p begin="00:06:53.26" data-timestamp="413.26">So after the tsunami and earthquake happened, word got out about Itaru's special Wind Telephone, that he was using it as another way to stay connected to the dead. Soon, people started showing up randomly on his property and walking right into the phone booth. This has been going on for five years now. Itaru estimates that thousands of people from all over Japan have come to use his phone. A TV station asked Itaru and the people who come to use his phone if they could videotape their calls from a distance and put an audio recorder in the phone booth. They wanted to get a sense of how people are still grieving.</p><p begin="00:07:28.04" data-timestamp="448.04">I watched their documentary after the fifth anniversary of the tsunami back in March. That whole week, all the news programs in Japan were airing memorial programs. But I found the calls in this particular program remarkable and moving for just how simple they were. One woman from Otsuchi, named Sachiko Okawa, showed up one afternoon. She's 71 years old, and lost her husband in the tsunami. She regularly brings her two young grandsons to the phone booth, and you can tell by how casually they talked to him on the phone. They squish into the phone booth with their grandma, wearing matching blue and black striped shirts. Sachiko starts the call by picking up the receiver and saying hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sachiko Okawa</h4><p begin="00:08:07.68" data-timestamp="487.68"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:08:09.55" data-timestamp="489.55"> Her oldest grandson quickly jumps in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grandson 1</h4><p begin="00:08:10.99" data-timestamp="490.99"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:08:12.25" data-timestamp="492.25"> Hi, Grandpa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grandson 1</h4><p begin="00:08:12.94" data-timestamp="492.94"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:08:13.90" data-timestamp="493.9"> How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grandson 1</h4><p begin="00:08:14.87" data-timestamp="494.87"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:08:15.94" data-timestamp="495.94"> I'll be in fourth grade next semester. Wasn't that fast?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Grandson 1</h4><p begin="00:08:18.89" data-timestamp="498.89"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:08:20.62" data-timestamp="500.62"> Daina, my younger brother, he'll be in second grade next year. Then Sachiko corrects him.

Her name is Kikue Hirano, and she's 66. She used to live in Otsuchi, but she moved away after she lost her house and her husband in the tsunami. Her husband was a deep sea fisherman. His name was Miyoji and they used to talk and drink sake together at night. Now, Kikue lives alone, about 50 miles away. But sometimes Kikue finds herself driving back to Otsuchi, and to this booth. I watched her do this thing that a lot of callers seemed to do. You hear Kikue actually dialing the rotary phone, saying some numbers to herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kikue Hirano</h4><p begin="00:10:09.76" data-timestamp="609.76"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:10:11.92" data-timestamp="611.92"> 4, 2, 5, 7, 4, 4.

She walks out.</p><p begin="00:11:14.33" data-timestamp="674.33">One pattern that the owner of the phone booth, Itaru, has noticed over the years is that more men than women come to use it. Not surprisingly, this is not a demographic that's known for sharing their feelings, especially the older farmers. They already have a reputation for not talking much. In one of the phone calls recorded in winter, a man with gray hair and a little towel hanging around his neck walks into the garden. This kind of towel is part of the uniform of Japanese farmers. They use them to wipe away sweat and clean their hands. This man opens the telephone booth door, and under his breath, you hear him say--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:11:49.18" data-timestamp="709.18"> [SPEAKING JAPANESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Miki Meek</h4><p begin="00:11:50.66" data-timestamp="710.66"> Huh, so this is the Wind Telephone.

I'm enduring. In Japan, [JAPANESE] is a catch-all slogan for slogging through life's many challenges, no matter how tiny or big. From trying to pass a test at school to grieving, you hear it all the time, for everything.

They're not automatically in heaven, happy and carefree. Many people believe that, if the dead see a family member suffering, they can't let go of their earthly life. They hesitate to cross to the other side, and end up stuck in a no man's land.</p><p begin="00:19:44.74" data-timestamp="1184.74">I heard these reassurances in a call from a 15-year-old kid named Ren Kozaki to his dad.

Ren lives in a city much farther north that wasn't affected as much by the tsunami, but his dad was a truck driver who drove all over Japan, and in a last-minute schedule change, he got sent on a route that took him along the coast when the tsunami hit. He's been missing ever since. Ren went into the phone booth wearing a red backpack.

For my father, not only did it push him away from Sheldon, making him feel jealous and resentful, but it also cast a shadow over the rest of his life, causing him to always feel passed over.

He went to school.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sheldon Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:55:48.32" data-timestamp="3348.32"> You're talking like I'm a failure in life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Buzz Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:55:50.47" data-timestamp="3350.47"> No, you weren't a failure.

My grandfather asked my father to drive him to the cemetery to visit his parents' grave. And once there, my grandfather wept inconsolably. Later that day, he would succumb to a stroke and shortly after be moved to a nursing home. With Sheldon being more local, the burden of my grandfather's care fell mainly to Sheldon. It seems like a lot of the family's burdens fell to Sheldon.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Buzz Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:56:57.63" data-timestamp="3417.63"> They put a lot of the responsibility on him that my dad should have been taking that responsibility.

I want to feel easy now. I want to say now he's going to be 86, I want to call him on his birthday and say happy birthday to him now. I'm not going to stand any [BLEEP] ceremonies anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:58:25.01" data-timestamp="3505.01"> As my father speaks, as per his brother's example, dropping F bombs like he's in a Guy Ritchie film, Sheldon keeps his arms crossed and his eyes shut tight.

But before we get into the rental, he points across the lawn to his neighbor's house. He tells my father that it's for sale, and then he tells him the asking price. And my father says that doesn't sound bad at all. And Sheldon says that, what, with Canada being so bloody cold, my father should consider moving to Florida. And my father says maybe he will.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Buzz Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:59:26.97" data-timestamp="3566.97"> All right.

And Jonathan has put together a playlist of his favorite episodes. Just search Heavyweight Starter Kit on Spotify. Jonathan, by the way, says his dad and Sheldon are doing fine under lockdown. Sheldon says that he's happy with the peace and quiet.</p><p begin="01:00:49.37" data-timestamp="3649.37">[MUSIC - THE BAMBOOS, "BEFORE I GO"]</p><p begin="01:00:49.87" data-timestamp="3649.87">(SINGING) I still wonder how we got to this, how we pretend not to notice.</p></div> </div>
