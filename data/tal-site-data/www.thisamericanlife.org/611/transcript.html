<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.73" data-timestamp="0.73"> Saturday morning, Chicago, four days after the Department of Homeland Security officially released its new policies on deporting undocumented immigrants. This is a workshop for the people targeted by those policies at the Mexican consulate. And it's packed. They had over 100 seats in this room, and when those filled, they added a second room. And then a third. People stand in the back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carlos Valera Paulino</h4><p begin="00:00:22.93" data-timestamp="22.93"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:25.72" data-timestamp="25.72"> Good morning to all of you, says an official from the consulate, Carlos Valera Paulino.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carlos Valera Paulino</h4><p begin="00:00:29.89" data-timestamp="29.89"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:33.61" data-timestamp="33.61"> Truth is, we didn't expect this many people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carlos Valera Paulino</h4><p begin="00:00:35.50" data-timestamp="35.5"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.13" data-timestamp="41.13"> But we understand the situation is worrisome, and that's why you're here.</p><p begin="00:00:45.56" data-timestamp="45.56">The president has been saying over and over that his new deportation rules are targeted at drug dealers, murderers, gang members. But if you simply read the guidelines, they say in black and white that's not what they do. The enforcement priorities now include all kinds of people who are not drug dealers, gang members, or serious criminals of any kind. Nearly anybody who's undocumented is covered. And it's been widely reported some of these non-criminals have been picked up already.</p><p begin="00:01:09.89" data-timestamp="69.89">Lots of people don't know this, but Chicago is a very Mexican city. Over half a million people with Mexican roots, a fourth of them undocumented. And the consulate sees itself as their ally. We care about you and your kids' future, one official says to the crowd, which is definitely not the message they've been getting lately from the American government. The consulate convened this panel explaining, OK, here's how to plan for the possibility that you'll get detained and deported. Like, OK, if you're taken, what'll happen to your kids? How do you plan for that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lawyer</h4><p begin="00:01:38.11" data-timestamp="98.11"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:42.94" data-timestamp="102.94"> A lawyer explains how to sign over the power of attorney to somebody to take care of your kids. Or how to make somebody their temporary guardian. Another speaker explained what to do with your home and bank accounts if you're deported. Yet another-- what if you own a business here in the States? An organizer named Erendira Rendon told the crowd that if immigration shows up at their door, don't let them in unless they have a signed and dated judge's warrant. Usually they don't. And she made the crowd practice in English what to say through the door.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Erendira Rendon</h4><p begin="00:02:12.38" data-timestamp="132.38"> OK, practica. I do not consent to your entry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>All</h4><p begin="00:02:16.51" data-timestamp="136.51"> I do not consent to your entry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Erendira Rendon</h4><p begin="00:02:18.88" data-timestamp="138.88"> I do not consent to your search of these premises.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>All</h4><p begin="00:02:22.19" data-timestamp="142.19"> I do not consent to the search of these promises.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:26.39" data-timestamp="146.39"> The little girl sitting near me said that last one as, "I do not consent to your search of these promises."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Erendira Rendon</h4><p begin="00:02:31.23" data-timestamp="151.23"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:34.66" data-timestamp="154.66"> I know it's hard, the speaker says, and that's why you have this. She holds up a packet everybody got. One page has all these same messages in English in big letters. She tells them that if immigration shows up, hold this page against the window. Don't put it up right when you get home today, she says.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Erendira Rendon</h4><p begin="00:02:50.56" data-timestamp="170.56"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p><p begin="00:02:52.55" data-timestamp="172.55">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:02:54.94" data-timestamp="174.94"></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:55.90" data-timestamp="175.9"> Just put it on the fridge, or leave it by the door. After nearly three hours of presenters and Q&amp;A, one of the last stragglers in the room was one of the moms, Cuca. She talked to one of our producers, Lilly Sullivan. Cuca says it's been hard watching how the possibility of deportation has affected her kids. She has two daughters. The older one is one of the DREAMer kids, covered by DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, so presumably, she's safe for now. But that could change. She's 19 and a sophomore on a full scholarship at a prestigious college they asked us not to name here. The younger one is a citizen, born here, just 11.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:03:30.33" data-timestamp="210.33"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:03:33.43" data-timestamp="213.43"> And I've explained to her what could happen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:03:35.04" data-timestamp="215.04"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:03:37.50" data-timestamp="217.5"> And she asks, what am I going to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:03:39.16" data-timestamp="219.16"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:03:41.27" data-timestamp="221.27"> And I tell her, you go with me. I won't leave you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:03:44.03" data-timestamp="224.03"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:03:48.04" data-timestamp="228.04"> I won't leave you anywhere. You're my daughter, and you go with your mom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:52.01" data-timestamp="232.01"> That's Lilly translating. Cuca recorded the workshop to play for her husband later to help them plan. The family sat down and mapped out a few different scenarios.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:04:01.41" data-timestamp="241.41"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:04:04.39" data-timestamp="244.39"> What happens if they deport one of us? What does the other one do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:04:07.07" data-timestamp="247.07"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:04:09.39" data-timestamp="249.39"> We've talked to our daughters, and they know the plan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Whitney</h4><p begin="00:04:12.87" data-timestamp="252.87"> I think it was my mom who called my sister and I to the living room.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:18.07" data-timestamp="258.07"> We talked to Whitney, Cuca's older daughter, at their apartment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Whitney</h4><p begin="00:04:21.07" data-timestamp="261.07"> She said, OK, we need to talk. We had to figure out and agree on if somebody gets deported, who will go back with them and who will stay.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:33.65" data-timestamp="273.65"> In their first conversation, they all decided that, if one of them was sent to Mexico, all four of them would go. But then later, Whitney's mom, Cuca, started thinking, you know, maybe Whitney should stay in America, finish college. So that became the plan. The other three would go. And then Cuca realized, oh, to set up a life in Mexico, they're going to need a lot of money. So she began to wonder, if she were deported, was it a good idea for Whitney's dad to leave with her and give up his American income?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:04:59.48" data-timestamp="299.48"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:05:03.30" data-timestamp="303.3"> So I said no. It can't be that, if I go back, he goes back. He has to wait and get some money together--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:05:08.55" data-timestamp="308.55"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:05:12.60" data-timestamp="312.6"> --to at least get a bed and light and gas. Basic things that we need to live.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:05:17.02" data-timestamp="317.02"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:05:19.03" data-timestamp="319.03"> And in the situation where he's deported--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cuca</h4><p begin="00:05:21.01" data-timestamp="321.01"> [SPEAKING SPANISH]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lilly Sullivan</h4><p begin="00:05:24.49" data-timestamp="324.49"> Jeez. It gets really complicated, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Whitney</h4><p begin="00:05:27.18" data-timestamp="327.18"> For me personally, it was devastating to have to have that kind of conversation and process the fact that we were having that conversation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:35.05" data-timestamp="335.05"> Seems like it was even harder for her little sister, Naomi, the 11-year-old, who kind of zones out in video games or just cracks jokes whenever the family starts talking about this stuff. The reality of having to relocate to Mexico, a country she's never set foot in?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Naomi</h4><p begin="00:05:49.41" data-timestamp="349.41"> Hoo, boy, was I freaked out because I thought that I couldn't take anything over there. Yeah, so at first I was worried about not having any snacks, not having any computers, not having any LEGOs, not having anything fun. So yeah. Some of those LEGOs, they don't even make anymore, like the SpongeBob LEGOs. I'm a big fan of SpongeBob. So yeah, that was the part that I was mostly freaked out about. Yeah. And school. I mean, would I continue?

Getting the last few official documents in hand, getting Naomi Mexican citizenship in addition to her American citizenship, so it'll be easier to move her to Mexico, if needs be. And they have this system that, when one of them leaves the house, when they get to where they're going, they call to say that they safely got there. Cuca worries most about her husband.

It's still not clear how aggressively the Trump administration is going to be deporting people under the new rules that they've just adopted. So much is still in the air.</p><p begin="00:08:59.15" data-timestamp="539.15">And one place you can see that is this hotline that a church set up in West Chicago, the Faith, Life, and Hope Mission. Erica Velasquez is one of the volunteers who answers calls-- on her personal cell phone, by the way. She told me she's getting 60 to 70 a day, and that it's driving her husband nuts.

The new guidelines say you can get prioritized for deportation if you receive government benefits you shouldn't have. So if the parents are not citizens but the kids are citizens, can they argue that the kids are the ones getting the food stamps? Are they OK?</p><p begin="00:09:59.01" data-timestamp="599.01">The guidelines also say you can get prioritized for removal if you committed or just been charged with any crimes at all. And people call asking about what they thought of as minor offenses on their records-- traffic tickets, DUIs-- would they now be prioritized for removal?</p><p begin="00:10:14.99" data-timestamp="614.99">I talked to one of the lawyers who spoke at the consulate, Salvador Cicero. He's a green card holder himself. He says one of the new guidelines he finds most chilling is the one that says to prioritize for removal anyone who quote, "in the judgment of an immigration officer poses a risk to public safety or national security."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Salvador Cicero</h4><p begin="00:10:34.61" data-timestamp="634.61"> Yeah, that is the scariest thing, I think. If, in his discretion, you pose a threat to public safety. What does that mean? Does that mean that if I am loitering, you are a threat to public safety. You're out. I mean, how wide is that power?

<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:43.24" data-timestamp="703.24"> Act One, That's Just How I Rule.</p><p begin="00:11:46.63" data-timestamp="706.63">I remember once visiting Hawaii and hearing about this island that, as outsiders and as white people, we were not allowed to go to. It was just for native Hawaiians, I remember being told. People sometimes call it the Forbidden Island. It's real name is Niihau. And even if you're from Hawaii, apparently it's a mysterious place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:12:04.00" data-timestamp="724"> I pretty much knew nothing about Niihau.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:06.19" data-timestamp="726.19"> This is Adia White, a public radio reporter who grew up on Maui.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:12:10.18" data-timestamp="730.18"> In school, we learned a lot about all of the other islands. A little bit about that history. But for Niihau, they pretty much told us nothing.</p><p begin="00:12:18.18" data-timestamp="738.18">[HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:12:22.89" data-timestamp="742.89"></p><p begin="00:12:25.31" data-timestamp="745.31">The little I knew about it was that it's a piece of the original Hawaii. That's what everyone kind of thought about it, right? Like on Niihau people live as they did before Hawaii was colonized. It's what it's supposed to be like.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:39.40" data-timestamp="759.4"> So for instance, it predates the kind of Hawaiian music that you're hearing right now. You can see Niihau on a map. It's to the west of Kauai. About 70 square miles or so. A lot smaller than Maui or Oahu or anyplace in Hawaii you normally hear about.</p><p begin="00:12:54.17" data-timestamp="774.17">Growing up, Adia didn't know what to picture it was like there. But she figured--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:12:58.42" data-timestamp="778.42"> Like an original-- a traditional Hawaiian village where it was governed by native Hawaiians. They decided who could come and who could go. They decided who they wanted to invite and how they wanted to live.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:09.95" data-timestamp="789.95"> So about a year ago, she started looking into what happens on Niihau. And she learned that it is not that at all. It's basically a family of white people who own everything and run the place even though they don't live there. They set the rules, which seem to be unwritten. And some of the rules are administered in an unpredictable sort of ad hoc way.</p><p begin="00:13:29.03" data-timestamp="809.03">One of our producers, Sean Cole, joined Adia in reporting the story this fall. You can't just go to Niihau and interview the islanders. And even the ones who leave Niihau and move to the other Hawaiian Islands, they're pretty tight-lipped about life there. But Sean and Adia found a handful of people who were willing to talk to them. Here's what they learned.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:13:46.82" data-timestamp="826.82"> How Niihau got this way isn't a secret at all. Basically, back in the 1860s, when Hawaii was still a kingdom, the king sold the island to a white family for $10,000 in gold. They wanted to ranch cattle on it. And there was a community of about a thousand native Hawaiians living there. According to the family, before the ink was even dry on the contract handing over the land, the king looked at them and said, the day may come when Hawaiians are not as strong in Hawaii as they are now. And if that day comes, please do what you can to help them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:14:19.59" data-timestamp="859.59"> That day, of course, did come, and the family has tried to keep their promise to the king all these years. And the way they interpreted helping the villagers was, let's preserve this place to be just as it was in 1864 when we bought it. So this is the last place on Earth where the language everybody uses every day is Hawaiian. They learn it as their first language and they speak an older form of Hawaiian than you hear anywhere else. Also, the lifestyle there is pretty spartan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:14:45.54" data-timestamp="885.54"> No running water, no electricity, no bathrooms. So it's outhouses that we use, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:14:55.38" data-timestamp="895.38"> This is Tuti Sanborn. She lives on Oahu now, but her family's from Niihau and she lived there every summer as a kid. She's the kind of person who uses phrases like "feel the aloha" in earnest and gets away with it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:15:07.17" data-timestamp="907.17"> So as the evening approached, we'd gather all of the lanterns and refuel them with kerosene. I remember my mom's kitchen. There was a kerosene stove in it. I remember doing that kind of stuff. I remember going to the wells to gather water.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:15:28.61" data-timestamp="928.61"> Tuti and the other Niihauans we talked to all described the same thing. No paved roads, no streetlights, one-floor houses with tin roofs, big yards, horses in the yards, peacocks and wild turkeys and pigs roaming around. And they fish and hunt for their food a lot of the time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:15:43.72" data-timestamp="943.72"> There's a church in the center of the village, and a kind of meeting hall. A little school. But no stores or anything. In fact, no one uses money on Niihau. There's no formal medical care there, either. No law enforcement. The pastor of the church settles any disputes that flare up.</p><p begin="00:16:00.42" data-timestamp="960.42">These days, they have solar panels to charge their phones and iPads and a few trucks to drive around the island. But mostly it's Hawaii circa 1864. Christian missionaries had been in the islands for decades by then. People told us that church attendance on Niihau is mandatory. Also, the family that owns Niihau, the Robinsons, are famous abstainers from all vice, and they've always required the residents of the island to live by those same values.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:16:25.32" data-timestamp="985.32"> No alcohol is allowed. No smoking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:16:29.88" data-timestamp="989.88"> No drugs. No guns. And if you're caught, say, drinking or doing drugs, you can get kicked off the island, which feels like a weird phrase to be saying out loud about real people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:16:39.79" data-timestamp="999.79"> The Robinsons insist that they're simply protecting the villagers from all the awfulness of the modern world, just like they promised the king. The oldest members of the Robinson family are Keith and Bruce. They're brothers, both in their 70s. There was a documentary made about Keith in 2005 called <i>Robinson</i> <i>Crusader,</i> about his work to preserve endangered plant species. And he talks a little about Niihau in it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Keith Robinson</h4><p begin="00:17:01.59" data-timestamp="1021.59"> I haven't seen any aircraft crashing into skyscrapers here. I haven't seen any plagues of AIDS here. As far as I know, there isn't one case of AIDS on the island. We have no drug problem. If there is any kind of a social problem here, the elders of the village sort it out by themselves. And if they can't handle it, they come to us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:24.98" data-timestamp="1044.98"> If this sounds like an oddly colonialist sort of project to have lasted into the 21st century, with white people setting the rules for native Hawaiians, I want to be clear. The villagers on Niihau are American citizens. They just happen to live on an island that's privately owned by this family. They can move away anytime they want. But if they want to stay, they have to respect the rules, that this is a regulated paradise. And people do want to stay. Everyone we spoke to who lived there, including people who have plenty of criticisms of the Robinsons, they all said they loved it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:54.84" data-timestamp="1074.84"> Did everybody really go to church on Sunday or do they try to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:17:56.70" data-timestamp="1076.7"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:17:56.97" data-timestamp="1076.97"> --sneak out of it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:17:57.70" data-timestamp="1077.7"> That was the only, only social event of the island besides parties, if they had parties.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:06.06" data-timestamp="1086.06"> What were the parties like? Were they drinking juice?</p><p begin="00:18:07.98" data-timestamp="1087.98"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:18:09.34" data-timestamp="1089.34"> You know, the parties were two weeks long.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:11.25" data-timestamp="1091.25"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:18:11.79" data-timestamp="1091.79"> Two weeks-- every day. And on Sunday. And on Sunday. It's an island full of aloha. So they'd have the parties for two weeks. So when they ordered food, they ordered a lot.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:25.05" data-timestamp="1105.05"> They have canned goods and other foods shipped over from Kauai to supplement the fishing and hunting. Or they go to Kauai and shop themselves sometimes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:18:32.64" data-timestamp="1112.64"> A couple of the rules on Niihau seem a little more arbitrary than the others. Pulani Kahokuloa says his dad was kicked off the island when Pulani was 13, and Pulani left with him. That was 30 years ago. He could go back today, except for one thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:18:47.06" data-timestamp="1127.06"> I have to cut my hair and shave.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:50.30" data-timestamp="1130.3"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:18:50.72" data-timestamp="1130.72"> (CHUCKLING) Yeah. That's kind of ridiculous.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:18:54.47" data-timestamp="1134.47"> No beards are allowed on the island. And no long hair on the guys. Pulani's a real ponytail, backwards-ball-cap kind of dude. And his sons have long hair, too. They'd all have to get haircuts if they want to go back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:19:05.48" data-timestamp="1145.48"> I don't know what's the reason, because I had uncles that showed me older pictures when they were young. They had like Elvis hair, like whoosh, like long hair.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:19:19.06" data-timestamp="1159.06"> So it's a new rule.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:19:20.18" data-timestamp="1160.18"> Yeah, it's a new rule. It's a silly rule.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:19:23.63" data-timestamp="1163.63"> Pulani has a really hard time with the haircut thing. He kept coming back to it during our interview. We'd be talking about the rules in general and his distaste for them, and then he'd say something like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:19:32.91" data-timestamp="1172.91"> Especially the silly one of cutting hair. That one. That's the mean one that blows everybody's mind away when they ask me, how come you cannot go back to Niihau [INAUDIBLE]? Oh, he's got to cut his hair. What? No way. Hawaiians had long hair back in the days. We looked like cavemen. I'd say, yeah. Well, not today. You gotta cut the hair.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:19:54.50" data-timestamp="1194.5"> It really bothers you.</p><p begin="00:19:56.00" data-timestamp="1196">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:19:57.80" data-timestamp="1197.8"> It does.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:20:00.08" data-timestamp="1200.08"> And there's a rule that Tuti Sanborn violated.

She was worried those traditions would be forgotten. So she writes about the island sometimes. And she did a series of TV interviews with her family, asking them what they remembered. Just innocuous stuff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:20:22.52" data-timestamp="1222.52"> I did one with my dad on saddle making.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leimana Kanahele</h4><p begin="00:20:26.00" data-timestamp="1226"> [SPEAKING HAWAIIAN]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:20:29.72" data-timestamp="1229.72"> I did one with my sister. I did a few.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:20:34.40" data-timestamp="1234.4"> In a way, she was doing the same thing the Robinsons were doing-- trying to preserve native Hawaiianness. Capture it in video amber. But the Robinsons didn't see it that way, and now she's not allowed back on the island. To them, the interviews, the articles, all of that violated what you could call the first rule of Niihau. You do not talk about Niihau.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:20:58.58" data-timestamp="1258.58"> This punishment-- barring some people from the island, even people who left by choice-- this was the thing the Niihauans we talked to were the most bitter about. Tuti's sister, Doreen-- everybody calls her Auntie Deer-- has been barred from moving back to Niihau because she spent too much time away. She lived on the island until she was about 30, but then she moved to Kauai to take care of her mom, who had a stroke.</p><p begin="00:21:20.06" data-timestamp="1280.06">After her parents died, she wanted to move back, but she couldn't, she says, because of Leiana. Leiana is a matriarch of the Robinson family, and she's the one you have to call when you want to go back to visit or to live full-time again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Auntie Deer</h4><p begin="00:21:32.69" data-timestamp="1292.69"> She said when we come here and stay here like one year or two years, we are considered outsiders. That hurt me. In my heart, it was like-- it was broken. My heart broke. I said, how can she say that? Because I was raised there. When I was born, I was raised there. She said that we belonged here, not there. I broke down, cried, and said, oh, how can that be? Because it's like the island is calling me to go back there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:22:15.29" data-timestamp="1335.29"> And it doesn't help that you can see Niihau from Kauai. Driving up and down the road that runs along the ocean, Niihau is a clear mountainous hump just a hop across the water. It feels so reachable, like you could just take a boat there yourself. But of course, you can't. It's private property.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:22:39.21" data-timestamp="1359.21"> The younger of the two Robinson brothers, Bruce Robinson, is considered the main boss of the island. But as he's gotten older, the day-to-day management of Niihau has shifted to his wife, Leiana, which was really exciting for the villagers because Leiana's one of them. She's native Hawaiian. She was actually the daughter of the pastor on Niihau, 30 years or so younger than Bruce. Tuti Sanborn remembers when they got together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:23:02.58" data-timestamp="1382.58"> Honestly, I thought, oh, great. Now we have our own that's in a place where she can make changes, and make good changes, and don't have to rule over our people so strictly, yeah? But no. She's just like the Robinsons. She treats the people just like the Robinsons have treated the people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:23:26.94" data-timestamp="1406.94"> Which is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:23:27.78" data-timestamp="1407.78"> Strict.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:23:37.49" data-timestamp="1417.49"> Tuti says she's asked Leiana a bunch of times if she can go back to the island. The way it works is that the Robinsons have a military surplus barge, like in <i>Saving</i> <i>Private</i> <i>Ryan--</i> the kind where the front drops down. They ferry livestock with it, and fuel, and other supplies. And people who want to go back to Niihau can ride over on the barge. Only 20 or 25 people can fit on board. The trip takes a couple of hours. And they run pretty frequently, maybe three times a week. You just have to call and schedule it in advance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:24:03.66" data-timestamp="1443.66"> And I remember calling on one occasion and she just said, oh, sorry, not at the moment.

There's no space.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:24:27.97" data-timestamp="1467.97"> You're laughing because that doesn't seem true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:24:30.86" data-timestamp="1470.86"> Yeah, because I know who goes. We all talk to each other and let each other know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:24:37.71" data-timestamp="1477.71"> How many times did you ask and how often?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:24:41.52" data-timestamp="1481.52"> Like three, four years consecutively I tried and was denied. So I just kind of stopped after that. Actually, no. I tried going to someone else. I would ask someone that's influential in my family, can you go ask Leiana that I want to go to Niihau? Still got denied. And I'm like, whatever. You're still my cousin. You cannot change that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:25:10.31" data-timestamp="1510.31"> This is something we hadn't thought of, but it was so obvious once people pointed it out. On an island this small, everyone's going to be related in some way. So this dynamic between Tuti and Leiana, it's a family dynamic. They're cousins. In fact, people use the word ohana, family, to describe the whole community of Niihauans, both on the island and off.</p><p begin="00:25:30.40" data-timestamp="1530.4">But while Tuti is technically a member of the ohana, Leiana doesn't really consider her that anymore. And there's no court of appeals. No due process. Leiana and the Robinson brothers had the last word.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:25:42.38" data-timestamp="1542.38"> Contrary to what Auntie Deer told us, there are people who move away from Niihau to Kauai for a couple of years who are allowed to return, but those folks are more tied into Leiana's inner circle. And as a result, they're really hard to interview. This is an important point. The people that you're hearing from in this story, they're a pretty self-selecting group. They talk to us because they either felt like they had nothing to lose or because they have some sort of issue with how the island is run, if not with Leiana herself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:26:17.37" data-timestamp="1577.37"> With all this policing of who can come and go on the island, and all the people banned from moving back, we wondered how many folks are left living on Niihau. Again, the whole point of this project is to try to preserve a place for native Hawaiians-- their culture and their language.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:26:31.56" data-timestamp="1591.56"> But even this most basic fact-- the population of Niihau-- was hard to pin down. Right before the Robinson's ancestors bought the island in 1864, again, there were about a thousand people living on Niihau. That's according to the census. And they were worried what was going to happen when the haoles, the white people, took over. In fact, the villagers wrote two letters to the Hawaiian government begging to buy or lease the island themselves, but nobody listened to them. Over the next four years, 700 people moved off of Niihau.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:27:00.39" data-timestamp="1620.39"> The latest census from 2010 says there are 170 residents on Niihau. But Pulani Kahokuloa told us the community has really dwindled since then.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:27:09.75" data-timestamp="1629.75"> Let's just see. Right now there is 1, 2, 3-- at least five families are left on Niihau.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:27:19.09" data-timestamp="1639.09"> So how many people is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:27:22.53" data-timestamp="1642.53"> About 21, 25 people?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:27:24.63" data-timestamp="1644.63"> Wait, what? There's only 25 people left on Niihau?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:27:27.39" data-timestamp="1647.39"> Yep. Just about. But you can try and confirm it with Leiana first. She might give you another different number.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:27:37.81" data-timestamp="1657.81"> I should say, by this point we had already started trying to get a hold of Leiana. I left a voicemail at her office. And then a retired reporter I got in touch with on Kauai told her we were working on this story, so I left a second voicemail. In any case, we've asked several people how many villagers are left on the island of Niihau and the range that keeps coming up is between 35 and 50.</p><p begin="00:27:58.88" data-timestamp="1678.88">Even a grocery store clerk on Kauai who grew up on Niihau said there's almost nobody left there. He wouldn't go on tape, but when we told him what we were doing, he said, does this mean people will get to go back now? Is that what the story's about?</p><p begin="00:28:20.19" data-timestamp="1700.19">[PHONE RINGING]</p><p begin="00:28:24.06" data-timestamp="1704.06"></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Answering Machine</h4><p begin="00:28:29.38" data-timestamp="1709.38"> This is Ira Glass, <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> Leave a message.

Contrary to popular belief, there is cell service on Niihau. I am on Niihau. I'm standing on just the wildest beach that I've ever been to. By wild I mean kind of like wilderness. It's like this weird, untamed beach with these lava outcroppings in it. And the water is this unreal multicolored organism. It's just fantastic here. So I thought I should call you from Niihau. And I'll see you soon. All right, bye.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:29:29.79" data-timestamp="1769.79"> Adia!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:29:31.78" data-timestamp="1771.78"> There is one way outsiders can set foot on Niihau.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:29:34.17" data-timestamp="1774.17"> Oop. Animal poop. Just like everywhere.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:29:38.00" data-timestamp="1778"> Back in the '80s, the Robinsons bought a helicopter partly so they could respond to medical emergencies on the island. And to offset the cost of it, they started offering tourist trips to Niihau. Not to the village. You still really can't get anywhere near the village. But anyone with $440, who's not afraid to ride in a helicopter, can take this half-day tour where you soar above the island and then land for a few hours on its northernmost beach.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:30:02.61" data-timestamp="1802.61"> It's a beach the villagers use themselves, though they stay away when tourists are around. So there were no people. Not a single building in sight except this one weather-beaten pavilion with a storage hut across from it. So miles of empty beach. And then, behind us, this baking landscape that is not beach, but red dirt, also vast, dotted with scrubby brush and dry grasses. It was like a piece of a foreign planet had fallen into the middle of the Pacific. Adia and I agreed it was unlike any place either of us had ever seen. It was kind of like we had discovered an island.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:30:37.10" data-timestamp="1837.1"> On the flight over, the helicopter pilot acted as a tour guide, pointing out sights, talking about the wildlife on the island. He told us that Niihau had been deemed by some the quietest place in the world. Although, as he pointed out, it's not clear how they measure those things.</p><p begin="00:30:53.86" data-timestamp="1853.86">I wouldn't call this the quietest place in the world at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:30:56.84" data-timestamp="1856.84"> It's not quiet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:30:58.22" data-timestamp="1858.22"> It's really loud here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:30:59.21" data-timestamp="1859.21"> It's very loud here.</p><p begin="00:31:01.93" data-timestamp="1861.93">We spent four hours roaming around on the beach, which didn't give us any more understanding of what life was like there. So here's some other stuff we learned.</p><p begin="00:31:11.34" data-timestamp="1871.34">First and foremost, it's been hard for the Robinsons to keep this place going. The ranching business is mostly unprofitable. They've tried other sources of revenue-- making honey, manufacturing charcoal, neither of which worked. They also run hunting safaris, where people pay to shoot the wild pigs and other game. And there are the helicopter tours, of course. But really, the most stable source of income on the island thus far is one that won't sound traditional, nor Hawaiian. Military contracts.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:31:38.29" data-timestamp="1898.29"> There's a Navy radar facility on the island, and a recent contract provides for 19 full-time-equivalent jobs. Also, various Navy exercises have been carried out on the island. The Robinsons seem to be proud of their contracts with the military. Keith, the older brother, talked with the villagers about working with the Navy at a public hearing that was held on Niihau back in 2015.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Keith Robinson</h4><p begin="00:31:58.79" data-timestamp="1918.79"> Without that money, frankly, your community, your jobs would not have survived. It's just that simple. For the time being, US Navy is your source of income that keeps all of you going here and which keeps us going and allows us to pay the taxes on this place.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:32:19.08" data-timestamp="1939.08"> The villagers are paid to maintain the radar facility-- and the ranch, for that matter. They live rent-free. We heard that some receive food stamps and other public benefits. As to the question of whether military contracts are compatible with the mission of preserving native Hawaiianness, Keith has said, it's a lot more compatible than tourism. The military is stealth, he said, and it doesn't leave litter behind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:32:46.03" data-timestamp="1966.03"> We tried a couple more times to reach Leiana to get her take on everything we'd heard, and it started to seem like a dead end. And then on our last full day on Kauai, a little before 9:00 AM, my phone rang. It was her.</p><p begin="00:32:59.30" data-timestamp="1979.3">I know what your name is, she said, but I don't know what your mission is. I explained as best I could, but I was nervous. In our minds, Leiana had been built up into this towering intimidator. But finally, she agreed to speak with us. Meet me at the helicopter office in an hour, she said. Somehow, both of our voices became very high when we got there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:33:20.11" data-timestamp="2000.11"> Hi. Good morning. Aloha. How are you?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:33:24.94" data-timestamp="2004.94"> Leiana's decidedly not a towering intimidator. She's maybe 5' 4", with long, dark hair, plaid shirt, jeans, and boots. She was very gracious and pleasant with us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:33:34.34" data-timestamp="2014.34"> Do you want to join us over here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leiana</h4><p begin="00:33:35.29" data-timestamp="2015.29"> Sure. Uh--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:33:36.71" data-timestamp="2016.71"> But as soon as she saw the microphone, her eyes widened. She said she didn't want to go on tape. So you're not going to hear her voice in this story. She said she tries to stay out of the media, if possible. She doesn't feel like she should be speaking for the whole community.</p><p begin="00:33:51.35" data-timestamp="2031.35">And she clearly doesn't have a lot of time for sit-downs like this. During our visit, her cell phone wouldn't stop ringing-- and the office phone, too. She's the point person for everyone now, she said. But she said she'd try to answer any questions we had. And then she said, you can phrase the answers however you want.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:34:07.29" data-timestamp="2047.29"> We told Leiana who else we'd talked to, and as soon as we said the first name, Tuti Sanborn, she did a kind of epic eye roll. Well, Tuti. I mean, she said, but she stopped herself. OK, OK, she said. Who else? Pulani Kahokuloa, I said, and she got tense again. You're all the way over here, she said, gesturing away from herself. She said our story was clearly one-sided. And that's why we came to you, I said.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:34:33.74" data-timestamp="2073.74"> And so we got into it. Leiana said there is a limit to how long you can be away out of the community and still be let back on Niihau. She can only accommodate so many people, and she has to make choices. She said, I don't know what Tuti's purpose is for going home. She's crossed a lot of lines.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:34:50.30" data-timestamp="2090.3"> What lines, I said. She said, people of the village don't want her being the voice of the people, meaning all the ways that Tuti documents life on Niihau for the rest of the world. And then she gave us this one example that really stuck in her craw that Tuti hadn't mentioned.</p><p begin="00:35:04.76" data-timestamp="2104.76">She said Tuti had worked as a consultant on an episode of <i>Hawaii</i> <i>Five-O,</i> the new rebooted version that's on TV now. In the episode, a college professor is murdered after sneaking onto Niihau to steal a rare plant. There are aerial shots of Niihau in the show, although the scenes in the actual village looked like they were filmed somewhere else. Tuti herself plays a village elder.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tuti Sanborn</h4><p begin="00:35:25.06" data-timestamp="2125.06"> [SPEAKING HAWAIIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:35:31.04" data-timestamp="2131.04"> Leiana said, it's not her right to be their point person on Niihau, especially a big production like that. They should have come to us. I've worked with <i>Jurassic</i> <i>Park,</i> she said. Which is true. There's a scene in one of the movies of the Robinsons' helicopter flying over one of their properties on Kauai. And so Leiana felt cut out of this one. Why is this any different, she said. Why are we killing each other?</p><p begin="00:35:53.83" data-timestamp="2153.83">We did a little fact-checking on this. For what it's worth, Tuti was not the point person on Niihau for <i>Hawaii</i> <i>Five-O.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:36:00.22" data-timestamp="2160.22"> We asked Leiana about the haircut rule-- Pulani's big favorite. She said they don't like tattoos on the island, either, or piercings, or hair dye. All of that stuff has gotten really out of hand, she says. And she says church attendance on Niihau is not mandatory.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:36:14.11" data-timestamp="2174.11"> Pulani's complaining caught her off guard, and she refuted him on pretty much every point. She gave a much higher number for how many people are on the island than Pulani did. Not 25. More like 125. And she told us, sometimes it's the community who doesn't want someone to come back on the island, in which case, they'll tell her, and she'll deliver the news. She's fine with being the bad guy, she says.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:36:36.82" data-timestamp="2196.82"> "You interviewed a whole different group than my group," she said. "We may be of the same blood, but they're not with me. I have to listen to the community. If you take a hike, you take a hike. That's all there is to it. They've given their heart elsewhere, so why should I waste my energy for these people that have come to the table to say blah, blah, blah, blah, blah over these people that have dedicated their life to going back to the family? It's a really-- you can put it however you want to."</p><p begin="00:37:08.01" data-timestamp="2228.01">Also, we finally got to talk with someone who is part of that close-knit group of Niihauans Leiana talked about-- Pulani's sister, actually, who also didn't want her voice on the radio. She said, "we like Niihau the way it is. And I believe the Robinsons are keeping it that way. They're really good people. Honestly, if you were the owner of an island but you live on Kauai, would you pay for the fuel for the barge to send people over for free and not charge for each box that they ship to Niihau? That means a lot to us. They really do take care of the people. I can't believe you guys came all the way from the mainland."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:37:49.23" data-timestamp="2269.23"> Thinking about all the rules on Niihau and the way they're implemented, at some point, I started to wonder. Should they even keep it going? When we were talking to Pulani, who clearly has a lot of problems with the way the island is run, we asked him about that. And he told us this story about his brother Iaone.</p><p begin="00:38:06.96" data-timestamp="2286.96">Iaone's married and has kids. He lived on Niihau all his life until he decided to try to make a go of it in modern life. So he moved on to Kauai with his family and got a job driving semi trucks-- delivery trucks. But he used to complain to Pulani about how expensive everything was. And then one day, he just disappeared.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:38:25.95" data-timestamp="2305.95"> And I got a call from his boss asking me, oh, where's your brother? I was like, I don't know. You should tell me. He works for you. And he was like, oh, he didn't show up to work for three days now. No call, no show, no nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adia White</h4><p begin="00:38:43.11" data-timestamp="2323.11"> So Pulani calls one of their sisters, who also lives on Kauai, and he says, do you know where our brother is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:38:48.81" data-timestamp="2328.81"> She started to laugh. She said, he went back. I said, what do you mean he went back? Yeah, he went back to Niihau. He picked up his family and went back to Niihau. When I finally talked to him, he said he was just over it. To him, it was harder to pay taxes, buy a car, keep up with the registration, rent a house, pay for the electricity, the water, gas. And not getting nowhere, living from paycheck to paycheck. He said he was more happy back home living off the land, living each day for that day. Because next day, it's a new day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:39:38.28" data-timestamp="2378.28"> So he had a harder time abiding by the rules--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pulani Kahokuloa</h4><p begin="00:39:42.78" data-timestamp="2382.78"> Of modern life than to the rules of the island of Robinson. He said he can put up with that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:39:54.09" data-timestamp="2394.09"> And Pulani later told us his brother Iaone, he's back living on Kauai now. He broke one of the rules. Pulani didn't say what it was, but Iaone was asked to leave Niihau, and he hopes that one day he'll be allowed back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:11.26" data-timestamp="2411.26"> Sean Cole and Adia White. Coming up, the head of one of the biggest financial institutions on the planet, a homeless guy, and one of our own producers all get called in on the same day in front of the same judge and the same set of rules.

<h3>Act Two: A Dave in Court</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:47.24" data-timestamp="2447.24"> We have arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, A Dave in Court.</p><p begin="00:40:51.65" data-timestamp="2451.65">A little while ago, one of our producers, David Kestenbaum, broke one of the rules that we in our country have decided all to abide by. He made a left-hand turn by a sign that says no left-hand turns. As a result, he ended up spending the day in the courtroom of this one judge. This judge who applied the rules with a fastidious consistency that's sometimes lacking on privately-owned Hawaiian islands. We thought it might be nice to end our show today by seeing what that's like exactly. Here's David.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:41:18.26" data-timestamp="2478.26"> If the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, this is basically the lowest. It's a municipal court. This one is for two towns in New Jersey. Still, the courtroom is an intimidating place. Wood paneling, wood seats, a giant official seal on the wall. In front of that, the judge's bench, which is raised like this physical reminder of who is in charge. There are a couple dozen of us here to have our cases heard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bailiff</h4><p begin="00:41:42.20" data-timestamp="2502.2"> All rise for the honorable Clarence Barry-Austin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:41:47.81" data-timestamp="2507.81"> Judge Clarence Barry-Austin walks in, black robe. And if you're hoping to be home in an hour, it's not going to happen. Here's how he starts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence Barry-austin</h4><p begin="00:41:55.58" data-timestamp="2515.58"> Now, the information I'm about to communicate to you will take a few minutes to do so, perhaps more than a few minutes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:42:02.51" data-timestamp="2522.51"> I know the word few can mean more than three. In this case, it means 22-- which is longer, by the way, than this entire story will be. He gives this long list of rules and information and more rules.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence Barry-austin</h4><p begin="00:42:13.79" data-timestamp="2533.79"> I have to accept your guilty plea. I have to evaluate that plea to determine that it is an acceptable plea of court--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:42:21.50" data-timestamp="2541.5"> The judge wants people to know all this stuff for their own protection, but he has another reason, as well. There is this much grander mission that he's on, though it doesn't come up until minute 20. And it's easy to miss.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence Barry-austin</h4><p begin="00:42:32.72" data-timestamp="2552.72"> It is important to the court that you leave here fully understanding our procedures, our protocols, and the circumstances surrounding your particular case. Whether you are happy with the result is less important to you. Really, frankly, it's less important to me--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:42:50.13" data-timestamp="2570.13"> He wants people to leave the court understanding how our legal system works. I talked to Barry-Austin about this. Months later, we sat down to do an interview. He says it's part of their training for municipal courts because, for some people coming in, their little traffic case could be their only contact with the legal system ever-- the only time they're in an actual court having their case heard, with all that wood paneling around them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence Barry-austin</h4><p begin="00:43:13.31" data-timestamp="2593.31"> That's one of the things that we talk about, the fact that it's important that they have a good experience, and a fair and an impartial experience here because this is where people will determine what they think of the judiciary as a whole.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:43:30.77" data-timestamp="2610.77"> Everything. Like up to the Supreme Court, like all the cases they read about in the newspaper.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence Barry-austin</h4><p begin="00:43:34.64" data-timestamp="2614.64"> Absolutely. They get a sense that judiciary functions in a fair and impartial way-- and a compassionate way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Kestenbaum</h4><p begin="00:43:49.82" data-timestamp="2629.82"> What makes this mission hard is that I and all the people around me here are on a mission of our own, and it is not the same mission. From what I can tell from our chitchat on the way in, a bunch of us are here because we are sure we should not have gotten the ticket. I fell into this category.

In one town, it's illegal to park on the street overnight. But in the other town, it's legal. He says there are no signs showing where the border is. Though when he lays all this out, the whole thing gets a little garbled because-- I saw this a few times when people go to court-- they sometimes try to use legal terms like they've seen on <i>Law</i> <i>and</i> <i>Order</i> or something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff</h4><p begin="00:45:13.54" data-timestamp="2713.54"> --this one, and that's why I came here, Your Honor.

And it turned out neither he nor the bank had any connection to the building, so it got dismissed. And then there was one woman who'd been in a minor accident.

I was nervous to be there in court, but I also felt like, I'm a rule-follower. If there's a sign that says no left turns, I don't make a left turn.
