<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.22" data-timestamp="0.22">OK, here's a joke that US servicemen in Iraq just love. This brings down the house, according to Tom Irwin, a comedian who just spent over a month entertaining troops in the Sunni Triangle, in Fallujah, in Mosul, near the border with Iran, all over the place. He came into the studio and told me the joke.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Irwin</h4><p begin="00:00:14.23" data-timestamp="14.23"> Black Hawk helicopters, I love them. I love the pilots. We've gotten to know many of the Black Hawk helicopter pilots. And I love Black Hawk helicopters. I do know a group of people who hate them. And those would be Iraqi sheep farmers.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:29.13" data-timestamp="29.13"> And that joke would kill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Irwin</h4><p begin="00:00:33.23" data-timestamp="33.23"> Yeah, no, it's yeah, it's very strong. Because that's how everybody gets around. Because you fly very low. So you can see the people. You can see them. So it has to do with-- and you watch all the animals scatter. So it's kind of, OK, Babu, OK, last one in the pen, OK, and then, tt-tt-tt-tt-tt-tt-tt-tt-tt. Ah! American! It's just this, I don't know, I'm sorry. I can't keep describing.</p><p begin="00:00:53.86" data-timestamp="53.86">It's so hard to leave that out there. Because it's just like, I am just so conditioned to have it have a different reaction. I'm sorry. I'm sitting in this studio, just like, oh my God. This is the greatest bad reaction I've ever heard.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.34" data-timestamp="66.34"> Listeners here in the United States may think we have some idea of what is going on among the American forces in Iraq. But really, we don't know their day-to-day lives. We don't know their habits. We don't know what annoys them most. We do not even understand their jokes. As Tom Irwin says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Irwin</h4><p begin="00:01:27.84" data-timestamp="87.84"> You have to be in Iraq, sort of.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:30.14" data-timestamp="90.14"> And so today on our radio program, an attempt to bridge the gap between the 140,000 Americans stationed in Iraq and the 290 million of us back home. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:01:45.02" data-timestamp="105.02">Today on our show, trying to find cigarettes in Fallujah. What US training tells you you should do if you hit a roadside bomb, versus what you should actually do, if you want to live. And what insurgents play over loudspeakers that freaks out Americans, and what Americans play to freak out Iraqis. We have two stories on our show today. Act One, we spend some time with some National Guardsmen a few miles from Baghdad. Act Two, our own Jack Hitt talks about what the Battle of Fallujah was really like with a marine lieutenant who commanded a platoon in Charlie Company, a lieutenant who also happens to be his nephew. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: When Weekend Warriors Work On Weekdays</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:18.91" data-timestamp="138.91">Act One, When Weekend Warriors Work Weekdays. Joe Betts signed up for the National Guard when he was 22. A friend was in the Guard, eight brothers in the Guard. He liked the military. At 42, he and his unit got called to service in Iraq. Joe had been working as an assistant minister in a Baptist church. And just two months before he got called up, he started his own church, which was progressing just fine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:02:48.89" data-timestamp="168.89"> The attendance was good. We had about 30-plus people there each Sunday evening at 3:00. And I think it was going along pretty good.</p><p begin="00:03:09.52" data-timestamp="189.52">We know that my unit, 239, has been called up to active duty. [INAUDIBLE] my strength in the Lord. I'm going through some hard times at this point in my life. It's a trying time. I need your prayers. I need your prayers. And I also would like to admonish the ones that have been attending services to continue to come. Continue to come. Don't stop. No matter what trials and tribulations come, he is telling us to press on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:55.00" data-timestamp="235"> Hey, Joe, when you signed up for the Guard, did you ever think that you would be deployed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:04:00.82" data-timestamp="240.82"> Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:02.53" data-timestamp="242.53"> You did?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:04:03.28" data-timestamp="243.28"> I did. But for me to go, they had to reenlist me. Because my enlistment was actually about up. My 20 years would have been over with. My enlistment period actually was over before we were sent. And so they involuntarily gave me another year.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:26.26" data-timestamp="266.26"> And if they had asked you whether or not you wanted to do that, would you have said that you wanted to do it, or that you wouldn't have wanted to do it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:04:35.37" data-timestamp="275.37"> At the time, I wouldn't have done it. I've had 20 years. And I felt like 20 years is enough to give to your country. I feel like I've done my duties. I don't feel like I owe anybody anything. And no, I don't think I would have went, if they'd have gave me that choice.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:58.16" data-timestamp="298.16"> Joe is one of the people in this new documentary series that's airing on a cable channel you probably don't catch too often, the Discovery Times channel. Two brothers from Arkansas, Brent and Craig Renaud, decided to follow one group of Arkansas National Guardsmen and their families from the announcement of their deployment to the day that the town holds a big rally to send them off, and into Kuwait and Iraq. Three episodes have aired already.</p><p begin="00:05:28.97" data-timestamp="328.97">The brothers are still out there filming. The unit is still there in Iraq. And because these guys have gotten to know these men and their families so well, living with them for months now, the brothers have witnessed and filmed all kinds of things that have never been documented anywhere else. 40% of the soldiers in Iraq are reservists, either from the Army Reserve or from the National Guard. What this means for Arkansas is the largest call-up of reservists since the Korean War, 2,800 soldiers. Craig and Brent followed the 57 guardsmen from the town of Clarksville, Arkansas. Here's Craig.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Craig Renaud</h4><p begin="00:05:58.84" data-timestamp="358.84"> Clarksville is a town of 7,000 people. One of the reasons we chose Clarksville is the majority of the National Guard that's in Iraq right now comes from small, rural towns like Clarksville. A lot of people that join the National Guard there do it for an extra paycheck.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:14.66" data-timestamp="374.66"> What do most of these guys think they were signing up for?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brent Renaud</h4><p begin="00:06:17.23" data-timestamp="377.23"> When they initially signed up, like anyone else who joins the National Guard, they think they're signing up for one weekend a month, and two weeks a year. After 9/11, obviously, that changed everything. But no one thought they were signing up for a deployment. They were signing up to hang out with their buddies one weekend a month, get to shoot guns and drive trucks around, but definitely not go fight in a war. And in the early episodes of Off to War, you see how taken aback they are.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:06:51.34" data-timestamp="411.34"> We are out in the middle of the desert in Kuwait, eating a meal that came out of a brown plastic sack on probably the most expensive camping trip America has ever seen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tommy Erp</h4><p begin="00:07:05.92" data-timestamp="425.92"> This is my response to the National Guards. What happened to one weekend a month, two weeks a year?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:12.79" data-timestamp="432.79"> This is Matt Hertlein and his friend Tommy. Matt signed up for the Guard because he wanted free college and extra money on the weekends, and because Tommy made it sound like it would be a good time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:07:22.14" data-timestamp="442.14"> The man I am today is because of that [BLEEP] right there. He is the one that I said, yeah, man, join the National Guard. Get drunk on the weekends and go to drills, and we can have all kinds of fun in college, partying. Yeah. Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Tommy Erp</h4><p begin="00:07:43.27" data-timestamp="463.27"> I see how much fun you're having in college.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:07:46.47" data-timestamp="466.47"> When's the last time you signed up for registration?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Craig Renaud</h4><p begin="00:07:50.51" data-timestamp="470.51"> Well, Matt Hertlein and Tommy Erp, the 19-year-olds who joined, coming out of high school, they've talked about there's not a whole lot of opportunities for them. Matt even made the comment that if I wasn't here with all of my buddies in Iraq, I don't know what else I'd be doing. Because one, everybody's in the National Guard that I know, and so they're here. And if I was back home, there's not a lot of opportunity for us. When we were at a party, their last party that they went to, just before they left, all of their friends were joking about how they couldn't wait for their friends to leave, because now there would be more jobs available that they could get, once they were in Iraq.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:23.33" data-timestamp="503.33"> At the very beginning of the documentary, before they're sent out, Matt and Tommy are the only ones who actually seem to kind of look forward to going to Iraq. They're younger than the other Guardsmen, didn't have responsibilities at home, and didn't know much about what was going on the war. Sitting on the couch in Matt's house with some family, they talked about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:08:41.00" data-timestamp="521"> It's an opportunity to me. We can go over there and get the job done. And I think it'll be fun. I'll try to make the most of it. I think I'll have fun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tommy Erp</h4><p begin="00:08:49.57" data-timestamp="529.57"> Friends are going. I've got family going. Going to be pretty fun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:08:54.84" data-timestamp="534.84"> My mom's not too happy about it. She's-- yeah.

Most of these are middle-aged guys who never thought that they would be deployed.

They were under the impression that the war was over, and that we would basically be doing security and stability operations, where we were just in the rebuilding phase of the country. Because they figured the major combat was over. And when we got here, that's not really what happened. We immediately started combat patrols. In fact, the second day that I was here, we were given a photocopy of a piece of a map and directions to a gate, and told to go out and start patrolling, looking for insurgents.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:56.44" data-timestamp="1136.44"> Sergeant Short and Matt Hertlein both told me they wish that they'd had more regular combat training, how to patrol, how fire weapons from different positions, how to capture and detain people.

Here's Brent Renaud.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brent Renaud</h4><p begin="00:19:13.25" data-timestamp="1153.25"> And if you remember, April of last year is when the security situation really started to deteriorate in Iraq.

Back before they arrived in Iraq, IED explosions were much less common than they are these days. Now they're so frequent that Sergeant Short's unit has been blown up two dozen times by IEDs. Three of those times, Sergeant Short himself was in the convoy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Short</h4><p begin="00:20:06.92" data-timestamp="1206.92"> And the thing that a lot of people, that I didn't know, until I'd actually been in one and got hit, is your radio is no good to you for about 10 seconds. So you may be trying to talk to somebody, but the explosion creates blast waves that interfere with the radio waves. And your communication equipment is no good for approximately 10 to 15 seconds. So it's imperative that everybody pay attention to what everybody else is doing. If you hear the explosion, you need to be looking to make sure everybody that's supposed to be with you is with you. So if for any reason you need to turn around and go back and pick somebody up or recover their vehicle, you can. But these are things we learned ourselves.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:47.60" data-timestamp="1247.6"> And so you didn't actually do drills on what to do if you're in a vehicle in a convoy and an IED goes off? That's not something you practiced for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Short</h4><p begin="00:20:54.61" data-timestamp="1254.61"> No, no. We just learned the hard way on those. The first time we had an actual Improvised Explosive Device go off, it disabled the truck. They were ambushed. One of the guys was killed.</p><p begin="00:21:05.55" data-timestamp="1265.55">They did train us. They did give us the standard procedure of what they wanted us to do. We followed those procedures.</p><p begin="00:21:15.03" data-timestamp="1275.03">And basically, what happened is a truck got left by itself with no combat support, because they did what they were trained to do, push forward 300 meters, and then assess the situation. Well, they had a truck that was disabled, and they pushed out 300 meters and left it there. And so those guys are in a firefight, fighting for their lives, and then they guys say, oh, we got to go back and get them. And then we got back, and the leaders all sat together and said, we did what we were trained to do. But it doesn't work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:46.66" data-timestamp="1306.66"> And how could they have trained you to prepare for those?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Short</h4><p begin="00:21:49.19" data-timestamp="1309.19"> Well, to be honest, really, in their defense, it would be very difficult for them to train us for something that they had no personal experience with. By the time they finally do go to Iraq, the guys have lost weight. In-country, they lose even more, wearing 60-pound vests all day in a place that gets up to 120 degrees. And some of the most disturbing moments in the film have to do with the equipment that they take with them, vehicles that the Arkansas National Guard's had for years, decades.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:25.18" data-timestamp="1345.18"> So these five ton dump trucks, the youngest one we have is 1956.

The vehicle that I convoyed in into Iraq, I was in the a back of a vehicle that had a pine box around it with sandbags in the middle of it. And they said that they hoped that they might slow the bullets down. They didn't have any hopes that it would actually stop a bullet, but it might actually slow it down and reduce the damage that it would do to you. So it certainly wasn't comforting to be convoying into Iraq in those type of vehicles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:23:10.89" data-timestamp="1390.89"> We were promised up-armor kits.

And the minute he was killed, everybody's demeanor changed, and everybody knew this was for real. I don't know. At least in the unit we were with, it seemed like a lot of guys weren't taking it that seriously until that happened. Two days later, another soldier was killed. I happened to be at the motor pool when they brought that vehicle back in.

I had a lot of people come to me and say, look, what do I do? I'm terrified. I don't want to go outside here. I'm consumed with fear.</p><p begin="00:30:56.97" data-timestamp="1856.97">I had one young man come to me and tell me that he had lost all his faith, that he was saved. His father was a pastor. He had been a Christian all his life. He said, I've lost my salvation. I can't deal with this. And so there was a lot of time spent talking to people, reassuring them, praying with them, praying for them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:16.88" data-timestamp="1876.88"> Yeah, what do you say to somebody when they tell you something like that? What can help them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Short</h4><p begin="00:31:21.28" data-timestamp="1881.28"> Well, the main thing that I had to do, and it was something that I had to reach deep down inside, was to show them that regardless of what happens, I was going to be there. We're going to go out there. We're going to do this together. I was going to be there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:37.31" data-timestamp="1897.31"> What happens next is that the guys turn it around. They totally step up to the jobs they were sent to do. They work well together. They look out for each other. Matt turns out to be one of the best gunners in the group. In 10 months, no other Guardsmen from Clarksville have died.</p><p begin="00:31:53.28" data-timestamp="1913.28">And people don't complain.

Here's Craig and then Brent Renaud.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Craig Renaud</h4><p begin="00:32:00.58" data-timestamp="1920.58"> As the deployment goes along, and as the film follows this deployment, they find out, just like the rest of the country did, things about 9/11 and the investigations that they were doing. There was actually a day when I was with them in Iraq, where the Stars and Stripes, which is the military newspaper that comes out, the front page was about the 9/11 panel commission, and the hearings, and there not being a link between Iraq and 9/11. And they were shocked when they read that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:28.92" data-timestamp="1948.92"> And what would they say? They're patriotic guys, so they're doing their duty and all that, want to support the President. But what's that do to them to see that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Brent Renaud</h4><p begin="00:32:39.30" data-timestamp="1959.3"> Since then, I think, maybe, they wished they had toned it down a little bit. But at that particular time, they said, we're angry. We were fooled. And we feel betrayed. And we're over here, risking our lives, and it's not what we thought it was, and that people were dying for something that they weren't sure if it was going to accomplish anything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:03.25" data-timestamp="1983.25"> Throughout this whole documentary, the Arkansas Guardsmen show this mix of doubts about their mission and a willingness to suspend those doubts and follow orders. When I asked Matt if he's hopeful about the way things work out in Iraq, he says, sure, they're definitely trying to help people there. Even Joe, who thinks there was no reason to go to war in the first place, is convinced that God must have some plan, some good reason of his own for putting Americans in Iraq. Here's what Sergeant Short thinks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David Short</h4><p begin="00:33:28.47" data-timestamp="2008.47"> I don't want to say that it's a lost cause, because I've lost good friends over here. And for me to say that would mean that they died for nothing. But it's very disheartening to me, because I work with the Iraqi National Guard. I've worked with the the new Iraqi Army. I've worked with the Iraqi police force.</p><p begin="00:33:48.72" data-timestamp="2028.72">And you've got the three security forces for this country that are in no way on the same sheet of music. They do not like each other. They do not trust each other. And their heart's not in it. And a lot of times, it's just very frustrating, because they just don't seem to care, one way or another.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:34:10.39" data-timestamp="2050.39"> Filmmaker Brent Renaud.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brent Renaud</h4><p begin="00:34:11.62" data-timestamp="2051.62"> I was out with the armed patrol the other day, and one of the Iraqi translators, as we were going up and down the road, we were talking to the local people and asking them, who was putting these roadside bombs out into the road. And the locals said, it's the Americans putting them out there, because they're trying to destabilize our country. As we went along the road, person after person was saying this same thing, which is very upsetting to the soldiers, because people in their unit had been killed by the roadside bombs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:34:48.14" data-timestamp="2088.14"> Joe Betts, the minister, says that being in Iraq has made him question his faith many times. He talks openly in the film about how the deployment is ruining his life, causing trouble in his marriage. Before he left for Iraq, he had some problems with neck, muscle spasms that were aggravated by all the weight that they were constantly carrying around in the military. Then a month into his deployment, he got this tingling and numbness in his arms and his fingers. It reached a point where he couldn't hold up his gun. And doctors said that a disc in his spine was out of place.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:35:15.96" data-timestamp="2115.96"> They looked at me, did x-rays, said, hey, we need to get you out of here, sent me to Landstuhl in Germany. They looked at me and said, you're on your way home, bud.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:27.06" data-timestamp="2127.06"> Is there a downside to coming home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:35:30.05" data-timestamp="2130.05"> The down side to me is coming home is I'm not in Iraq with my guys. That's my downside. And the downside again is that I have to hear all the bullcrap from people that don't understand what I'm going through.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:47.38" data-timestamp="2147.38"> What are you talking about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:35:50.89" data-timestamp="2150.89"> There's "if you didn't get hit with a shrapnel, you shouldn't be at home," you understand?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:59.44" data-timestamp="2159.44"> People say this to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:36:01.23" data-timestamp="2161.23"> Yeah.

Doctors locate the problems in MRIs and in x-rays. But in Iraq, Joe had been so vocal about how he didn't want to be there. He was more vocal than anybody we see. Some guys now think that he was just trying to get home early. Here's Matt Hertlein.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:36:23.13" data-timestamp="2183.13"> A lot of people believe that that he faked the injury to go home because he was having problems with his wife.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:36:32.01" data-timestamp="2192.01"> And what do you think?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Matt Hertlein</h4><p begin="00:36:36.11" data-timestamp="2196.11"> I don't know.

It's crazy. Basically, I try not to go anywhere that much, because I don't really like dealing with public. And basically, that's all they want to talk about. So I just, I try not to, but I can't keep from it, because I got two girls that plays basketball. And so I'm out there all the time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:21.93" data-timestamp="2241.93"> At their games.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Betts</h4><p begin="00:37:24.27" data-timestamp="2244.27"> Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:25.19" data-timestamp="2245.19"> Wow.

Because they would come home on leave, and no one would call me. They wouldn't call to say, hi, or anything. To me, that bothered me. I didn't understand that. And then I had even my platoon sergeant, he came home, didn't call me.</p><p begin="00:38:03.96" data-timestamp="2283.96">I called a few of them that I knew was in. They didn't return my call. It was frustrating for me. I didn't understand it. I thought that they was just faulting me for being home. And actually, I found out, some of them really was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4> Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:38:19.54" data-timestamp="2299.54"> The people signed up for the regular Army, or the Air Force, or the Navy, they and their families know that it's going to take over their lives. They're going to move from base to base. They might go to war and have to deal with that. The National Guard is different. And much of this documentary series ends up being about people, complete families, who never expected to go to war, and what war does to them.</p><p begin="00:38:46.27" data-timestamp="2326.27">Matt's mother cries on the phone with him. He grows up amazingly fast. Sergeant Short ends up proud of the work he does in Iraq, keeping his men safe. And for Joe, who was re-endlisted against his will, after all, it's hurt his marriage, given him permanent injury, and he lost his church. When he was away, attendance dropped to seven people. And then, nobody was coming to services anymore.</p><p begin="00:39:08.25" data-timestamp="2348.25">Until his unit's deployment is finished, and the rest of them come back from Iraq, his job every day is to go to the National Guard armory, where he and two other injured guys do some paperwork, when there's paperwork to do. They sit by the phone. They answer it when it rings. He reads the paper. He started reading some technical manuals to pass the time. The phone doesn't ring much.</p><p begin="00:40:27.20" data-timestamp="2427.2">[MUSIC PLAYING - "TENDER COMRADE" BY BILLY BRAGG]</p><p begin="00:40:46.68" data-timestamp="2446.68">Coming up, the Battle of Fallujah.

What's it really like for American soldiers in Iraq? We've arrived at Act Two of our show. Act Two, Marine Life. In this act, the most basic story that we rarely hear about war, what it's really like to fight on the ground, house to house.</p><p begin="00:41:27.07" data-timestamp="2487.07">Rob Miller is a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps, commanding a weapons platoon of about 40 guys in Charlie Company. He's 30 years old. He loves the Marines. He's been a marine for a decade. In early November, Rob led his men in the Battle of Fallujah. After it was over, he talked with his uncle, Jack Hitt, by satellite phone from a camp east of the city.</p><p begin="00:41:45.37" data-timestamp="2505.37">A quick word of explanation about some of the terms that Rob uses. Devil dogs and devils are Marines. Psy-ops are psychological operations. IED, of course, is Improvised Explosive Device, the booby-trap bombs that have caused the most casualties in Iraq.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:41:57.23" data-timestamp="2517.23"> Good morning, Fallujah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:41:59.48" data-timestamp="2519.48"> So, Jack, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], how are you doing?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:42:04.73" data-timestamp="2524.73"> How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:05.83" data-timestamp="2525.83"> I'm doing pretty good. I'm trying to light a cigarette. Right when I went on emergency leave, I ended up smoking again. And then Fallujah's like, it doesn't deny of your nicotine habits. It's like a mandatory. So people who don't smoke, now smoke. People that used to dip now dip and smoke.</p><p begin="00:42:25.21" data-timestamp="2545.21">I say, I was absolutely out of cigarettes. And we had Marines that were coming up with these little Iraqi cigarettes. Because we were paying the interpreters to get cigarettes for all the Marines.</p><p begin="00:42:37.82" data-timestamp="2557.82">And lo and behold, my old buddy friggin' sent me a package. And then it was like six packs of cigarettes. And all he wrote was, I started smoking in Fallujah when I went. Here's some smokes for you. I'm like, oh my God.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:42:51.94" data-timestamp="2571.94"> So what's been happening today?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:56.76" data-timestamp="2576.76"> Today's pretty laid-back. All my guys are out in the old firm base. And we're still hardening the firm bases. It's pretty funny. We go to these places, and we harden these firm bases. And you fill, I don't know, 10,00, 15,000 sandbags. You lay 200 rolls of Concertina wire. You put out trip flares, fill the earthen berms. With Charlie Company, specifically, we do that for 7 to 10 days, and then they say, hey, you're moving. You're like, oh, you're kidding me. Then you turn it over to somebody else. And they're like, hey, nice firm base. You're welcome, bastard.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:43:31.64" data-timestamp="2611.64"> So you were doing this house-to-house clearing stuff. This is what we're seeing on our TVs here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:43:39.46" data-timestamp="2619.46"> Oh yes. This is pretty crazy. We push from the north part of the city through the breach on foot, all the way to the center of the city. And anywhere you went, you'd look out a window, and a sniper would try to shoot you.</p><p begin="00:43:54.84" data-timestamp="2634.84">Every time you moved, you don't just walk across. You don't walk anywhere. Everywhere you go, you're moving to get behind cover, even if it's a telephone pole. Telephone pole, if that's all you've got, that's good cover, if that's all you got.</p><p begin="00:44:11.52" data-timestamp="2651.52">I saw tons of Marines hide behind gutters in the roads, shooting from underneath gutters. Four inches of cover, that's nothing. But if all you've got's four inches, four inches is beautiful. The whole first night, we went basically two blocks the whole first night.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:44:32.44" data-timestamp="2672.44"> Can you describe what was it like? What did you do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:44:38.12" data-timestamp="2678.12"> Well they had the first day of the initial bombing. And it was actually really good. We sat all day. And we watched the city just being bombarded.</p><p begin="00:44:46.92" data-timestamp="2686.92">They were hitting targets. They were hitting key fortifications. And people were moving around. They were hitting them. JDAMs, laser-guided bombs.</p><p begin="00:44:54.69" data-timestamp="2694.69">And so we sat all day. There was this symphony of destruction. And it just played out until it got dark. And then when it got dark, it's like, all right. Now that it's dark, it's time for the grunts to go in.</p><p begin="00:45:12.13" data-timestamp="2712.13">But yeah, the first night we went in, going through the breach, this was pretty weird. We had psy-ops behind us. And they're blaring music into the city. It's just huge speakers are screaming music into the city.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:45:25.57" data-timestamp="2725.57"> What music?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:45:27.77" data-timestamp="2727.77"> I don't know what the tune was, from Full Metal Jacket. At the very end of Full Metal Jacket, they're walking through Saigon, I think it is, or, it's one of the big battles at the end of the movie. And they're on patrol. And there's this funky '70s music going. And that's what they were blaring, as I crossed the breach. And all I could think of was Full Metal Jacket.</p><p begin="00:45:54.00" data-timestamp="2754">And I was like, you got to be kidding me. You're playing that while I'm crossing this breach? That's not what I want to hear.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:46:00.87" data-timestamp="2760.87"> Yeah, what music would you have chosen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:46:04.85" data-timestamp="2764.85"> "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor," that's a good one, really fast-paced. But yeah, they were just playing crazy stuff. And they've got some kind of method. I don't know how it works. It was definitely annoying me. I can't imagine what it was doing to the bad guys.</p><p begin="00:46:21.25" data-timestamp="2781.25">Yeah, we were pushing into the city. Even on certain days, you push into the city. And as you progress further, the mosques would be screaming for people to rise up. And there was one, it was the middle of the night. And we were pushing through these alleys to push forward.</p><p begin="00:46:37.19" data-timestamp="2797.19">And I just remember this mosque, the guy on the speaker was just screaming. He was just like yelling in Arabic, a-la-la-la-la. And he's like, ha-la-la-la jihad, ha-la-la-la jihad, jihad, jihad. Ha-la-la-la-la, jihad. And I was like, God, will somebody shoot those speakers. 10 minutes later, there was just this mass of gunfire, and all the speakers went silent, because they shot all the speakers.</p><p begin="00:47:02.95" data-timestamp="2822.95">The fourth day into the fight, we went from the-- I was at the [? al-Hidra ?] mosque with my mortars. And we got the word we were pushing to the mayor's complex, which is right in the center of the city. And we pushed to the mayor's complex in tracks. And we were maybe less than 100 meters between where the tracks dropped us off and the building we had to go to.</p><p begin="00:47:25.13" data-timestamp="2845.13">And our foot movement from there, it was basically a sprint, our sprint from the track all the way to the building. And we had snipers trying to peg us the whole way. Just rounds zinging by, hitting the dirt.</p><p begin="00:47:38.36" data-timestamp="2858.36">And we got into this building, and that's when we found out that the entire mayor's complex was surrounded by snipers. And they were just pinging at anybody that could frickin' walk in the open. So we initially took all our extra mortar ammunition, and each mortar can probably weighs, I don't know, 30 to 40 pounds. We have our Marines divvy up. And they're carrying mortar rounds in their pack.</p><p begin="00:48:06.30" data-timestamp="2886.3">And then we have an extra, probably, 8, 10 cans that we're taking into combat. So we tie these things onto these huge D9 tractors. And we cinch them down. And everything was good until we go through the breach and one of the D9s gets stuck in this huge mud bog. It sinks, because it's so heavy.</p><p begin="00:48:26.28" data-timestamp="2906.28">And so we got to send people back into the breach to get our ammo. But the problem was, when they pulled it off the first D9, they cut the straps, instead of untying it. However they got it off, they cut it off and they brought it. We can't reattach it. So we had to use a casualty stretcher.</p><p begin="00:48:41.86" data-timestamp="2921.86">So we use this casualty stretcher, and we heap all of our ammo on it. So when we move, I got two Marines lugging 200 pounds of ammo. You're not moving fast. You move across a road in a dead sprint carrying 200 pounds of ammo, the two of you, it's a shuffle. It's a shuffle. You're shuffling across the road, like, don't get shot. Don't get shot. Don't get shot.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:49:08.96" data-timestamp="2948.96"> Oh, man. By the way, were you ever scared?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:49:11.89" data-timestamp="2951.89"> Well, to a certain degree, yeah. You're definitely freaked out at certain times. The first night we were moving forward, and it's probably the only time I was ever scared for my company and my battalion, we were pushing forward. It's pitch black. There's no moon. And it's raining, and it's drizzling.</p><p begin="00:49:35.01" data-timestamp="2975.01">And it's 40 degrees out. And everybody's freezing. And my unit's pushing forward. And it's just contact the whole way.</p><p begin="00:49:45.22" data-timestamp="2985.22">And all of a sudden, we get the call over the radio, we got a Marine down. We got a Marine down. We got IEDs in this alley. An IED just went off. So two Marines, they went in to get this guy. Boom. Friggin', these two other guys go down. So now they got three guys in this alley that they think is-- the whole alley is IEDs. And that was the big fear, is that there were just going to be IEDs all across the city. I was like, oh my God. We're going to take so many casualties. It's going to take forever for us to move. Can we do it? Sure. But it's going to be absolutely horrible.</p><p begin="00:50:22.08" data-timestamp="3022.08">At the same time, 3rd platoon had massive contact further down to the east. 1st platoon was actually held up, because they were in a massive engagement to our flank, far east. Bravo Company was just shooting all across their line. And I was like, how can they-- they wanted us to push all the way to the Hidra mosque that night. And I was like, how can they expect us to push to the Hidra mosque.</p><p begin="00:50:49.67" data-timestamp="3049.67">It's totally non-feasible. We got three Marines that are down, and they are wounded. And it was two, three minutes later that the platoon commander came back on. He's like, it wasn't IEDs. It wasn't IEDs. There's a guy in a second story, and he's frickin' throwing hand grenades in this alley.</p><p begin="00:51:10.36" data-timestamp="3070.36">And so they just light this guy up with everything they own. They're throwing the kitchen sink up at this guy. They finally kill this guy.</p><p begin="00:51:18.81" data-timestamp="3078.81">And then the same time, our tanks that were attached to us, Panzer, these guys call us. And he's actually on the road facing east. And he's like, when he calls, you can hear his 240 Golf shooting, and his 50-cal shooting. And he's just like, oh my God. He's like, you need to get somebody else down here. He's like, there's 50 to 60 people retreating from the north to south. And they're just flowing across the road. He's like I can't kill them all.</p><p begin="00:51:49.27" data-timestamp="3109.27">And he must have killed 30, 35 people. And he didn't, he couldn't even-- I don't even know if he made a dent. They were just flowing to the south away from us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:51:59.77" data-timestamp="3119.77"> This is your second time in Iraq, correct?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:52:02.44" data-timestamp="3122.44"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:52:04.10" data-timestamp="3124.1"> Yeah, and the first time, you didn't see combat, anything like this, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:52:08.71" data-timestamp="3128.71"> No, no, no. It was pretty cool. My platoon was the first Marine unit on the deck in Mosul. And so we got there expecting to get off and get into a firefight. But it wasn't like that. It wasn't anything like Fallujah.</p><p begin="00:52:28.19" data-timestamp="3148.19">It wasn't really out of control. As soon as we got there, CNN showed up. And they were like, the Marines are on the deck in Mosul. And then everything quieted down.</p><p begin="00:52:39.05" data-timestamp="3159.05">Everybody was like, oh, US forces are here, good to go. Everything's good. Go home, relax. And I did a lot of missions where I would go and just stand on the road and wave at cars. And I really felt like I was trying to collect money. Money for the poor. And I'm out there with a gun.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:53:00.04" data-timestamp="3180.04"> Now that you've seen combat, would you want to go into it again? Or do you feel like you're cured?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:53:06.63" data-timestamp="3186.63"> Yeah. It's a good question. Some people definitely are, they're like, that's it, we're done. But I don't know. It's a tough thing. It's really tough.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:53:21.05" data-timestamp="3201.05"> Well, now that you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:53:22.46" data-timestamp="3202.46"> I will say that now that I've been in pretty intense combat, you could say, I'm like, that's good to go. We need to [UNINTELLIGIBLE] dragons, as we say. We're good. We need to get our job done and get home.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:53:37.93" data-timestamp="3217.93"> Yeah. Right. Did you ever get the boxes we sent you, of food?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:53:43.12" data-timestamp="3223.12"> Oh, I got them. Yeah, the artichoke hearts? Yeah, that was great.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:53:48.14" data-timestamp="3228.14"> It was mostly junk food.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Miller</h4><p begin="00:53:49.81" data-timestamp="3229.81"> Oh my God. And those artichoke hearts, I was laughing. I was laughing to tears. And a foreign observer came in, this lieutenant, and he's like, no way. I love artichoke hearts. And I was like, well you are in luck, Neville. And I was like, because I've got a whole jar of artichoke hearts that's got your name on it. And he was like, oh yeah.</p><p begin="00:54:09.93" data-timestamp="3249.93">But we get a lot of good stuff. We get tons of stuff from kids in schools. And we get a lot of crayon drawings that are, you know. The marine is this huge person. And the Iraqis these little small people. And we're throwing hand grenades. And they're like, run away.</p><p begin="00:54:28.18" data-timestamp="3268.18">We get some, though. Especially when you get into middle school and high school, then you get the political kids. The funniest one that comes to my mind was from some youth group out of New York or something. They sent us a bunch of stuff. A couple of them were like, I think President Bush is crazy, and you got to be kidding me, and what are we doing over there.</p><p begin="00:54:47.06" data-timestamp="3287.06">[LAUGHING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:54:47.66" data-timestamp="3287.66"> So listen, I have a joke for you.
