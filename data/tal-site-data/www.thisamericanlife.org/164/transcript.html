<h3>Prologue</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:06.17" data-timestamp="6.17"> I'm in the Office of Dr. LJ Drakovic, who examines dead bodies for the police in Pontiac, Michigan. And he's running through this carousel of slides, all of them murder victims. There are closeups of body parts.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:16.94" data-timestamp="16.94"> To say, as you just flip through these things, this is the grisliest slide show I've ever seen. It's just like every slide is some...</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lj Drakovic</h4><p begin="00:00:23.89" data-timestamp="23.89"> --is another story, yes. Every crime scene is a story of its own, is a novel. And it opens up in every direction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.19" data-timestamp="41.19"> To illustrate, he tells me this story. When he worked for the Wayne County coroner's office back in Detroit, there was a young woman. This story, by the way, might not be suitable for younger children.</p><p begin="00:00:50.82" data-timestamp="50.82">Anyway, there's this young woman who apparently killed herself by taking her boyfriend's gun, putting it in her mouth and firing. The police, the other medical examiners, everybody thought it was a suicide. But something about the case bothered Dr. Drakovic. The woman didn't have a history of depression. There was no note.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lj Drakovic</h4><p begin="00:01:06.87" data-timestamp="66.87"> My colleagues teased me as being paranoid and seeing things where they were not. I did the examination. I did the examination of the oral cavity. And in this particular case, the tongue showed two holes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:27.87" data-timestamp="87.87"> This is very strange, Dr. Drakovic explained, because usually-- again, this gets a little explicit-- usually, when people shoot themselves in the mouth, they kind of point the gun upward, toward the brain. Their tongue does not get injured at all. But here, the tongue must have been all bunched up, pushing hard against the muzzle of the gun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lj Drakovic</h4><p begin="00:01:46.95" data-timestamp="106.95"> Now, who in this world, trying to end life, will inflict additional pain and discomfort by shoving the muzzle of the gun against the tongue? Unless it's another person. In my assessment of this, this was a homicide.</p><p begin="00:02:15.68" data-timestamp="135.68">So I told the detectives that that was my finding. They went back to interview the boyfriend. And they said, we know that you shot her. He said, no, I didn't. They said, yes, we know. The doctor told us. He said, what doctor? They says, the doctor that did the autopsy. He said, what autopsy? I called the coroner's office two weeks ago, and they told me they never did autopsies on suicides.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.02" data-timestamp="174.02"> Of course, why call the coroner's office to ask that question if you're not planning on killing anybody? It did not take very long for the police to get a confession out of this guy. As Dr. Drakovic says, every crime scene is a novel.</p><p begin="00:03:06.89" data-timestamp="186.89">Today in our radio program, crime scenes and the stories behind them. For WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:03:16.49" data-timestamp="196.49">Act One of our show today, How Do We Know? A forensic criminologist explains exactly what it is that we can learn from evidence at a crime scene.</p><p begin="00:03:25.19" data-timestamp="205.19">Act Two, Grime Scene. Nancy Updike reports on how watching the movie <i>Pulp</i> <i>Fiction</i> led one man to a life coming in after the police and the investigators are done.</p><p begin="00:03:36.38" data-timestamp="216.38">Act Three-- in the second half of our show, I have to say, everything gets a little less grisly. Act Three, A Criminal Returns to the Scene of the Crime, a story of a thief who returns to the neighborhood where he robbed and conned people, to coach little league.</p><p begin="00:03:51.12" data-timestamp="231.12">Act Four, What Police Cannot Do. We have this completely beautiful, haunting story by Aimee Bender about a little boy who can find any lost object, any stolen object, from any crime scene. Stay with us.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act One: How Do We Know?</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:15.27" data-timestamp="255.27"> Act One, How Do We Know? Well, we thought we would start this hour with a quick primer on some of the kinds of evidence that investigators find at crime scenes and what it tells them. Enrico Togneri is a former forensic criminologist in Nevada. He says there's a lot of information contained in something as simple as the shape of a blood stain. He talks about high-velocity blood stains and low-velocity blood stains.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:04:35.45" data-timestamp="275.45"> Well, the blood spatter, when you have a low velocity, something like an arterial cut, where somebody is cut in the artery and it's actually spurting out of the body, you get fairly large stains because you have quite a bit of blood coming off at the fairly low velocity.</p><p begin="00:04:51.50" data-timestamp="291.5">Higher velocity, like somebody being hit with a baseball bat, you're going to get a teardrop shape. The lower the angle, the more the teardrop. If it's straight on, it's going to be a nice round droplet.</p><p begin="00:05:02.66" data-timestamp="302.66">And then if you have high velocity, which is a gunshot, you almost get a mist because of the impact of the gunshot causing an explosion of the blood. So you get a very fine mist.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:14.57" data-timestamp="314.57"> And I understand that from the shape of the droplets, you can tell where the person was standing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:05:19.64" data-timestamp="319.64"> Yeah, it's basic trigonometry. What you do is you take the width of the bloodstain and the length of the bloodstain, and you find the angle. And from the angle, you can actually string it. You can actually run a string back away from the wall of the angle you've determined it to have impacted at. And if you do this from several little droplets, you eventually come to a point where they bunch up. And that would be where the blood impact actually originated.</p><p begin="00:05:52.97" data-timestamp="352.97">There was a case where an individual had said that he got into a fight with his roommate, and the fight occurred as they were standing up. And he hit the guy, and the guy finally dropped dead.</p><p begin="00:06:05.66" data-timestamp="365.66">But in reality, when we constructed the blood spatter by stringing it, we could show that all came from a fairly low place on the floor, from a few inches up from the floor. And you could show that most of the impacts happened when the individual was already down, so therefore taking away the self-defense issue.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:23.19" data-timestamp="383.19"> In other words, he was kicking him while he was literally on the ground.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:06:25.91" data-timestamp="385.91"> That's correct.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:33.68" data-timestamp="393.68"> Could I just get you to list briefly all the things that you can learn from all the types of evidence that are there on a scene?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:06:40.18" data-timestamp="400.18"> Yeah, there's certain routine things that you would look for. And let's say you get into a scene where there's still some food on the table. You want to see if it's still warm. You want to see what the food is. You want to see where the placing of the utensils might be. That might give you a clue whether it's a right-handed or left-handed person that was last there.</p><p begin="00:07:00.44" data-timestamp="420.44">You want to actually observe everything that's there as far as, do you see any blood, any hair, any fibers? If the police officer who was there at the crime scene, who got there first, or even one of the witnesses who got there first, if you can get them to describe, was there any unique smells? A smell could be important-- a cigar smoke. You never know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:22.24" data-timestamp="442.24"> If you can remember, can you think of a case where an utterly ordinary object ended up being the piece of evidence that clinched it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:07:32.35" data-timestamp="452.35"> Well, as a matter of fact, there was a burglary with a piece of cheese that had a tooth mark in it. And we were able to match the bite mark to the individual that did the burglary.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:43.73" data-timestamp="463.73"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:07:44.47" data-timestamp="464.47"> Just a piece of cheese left in the refrigerator. The individual decided to help himself to some food. And he took a bite out of a piece of cheese. And he had a unique enough bite mark that we were able to identify it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:56.41" data-timestamp="476.41"> When the police are done with a crime scene, who actually cleans up the crime scene?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Enrico Togneri</h4><p begin="00:08:01.09" data-timestamp="481.09"> Usually the person who owns the property. We would mark it as a possible biohazard, and then the individual would hire whoever he wanted to hire to have it cleaned up.</p></div> </div>

<h3>Act Two: Grime Scene</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:08:18.93" data-timestamp="498.93"> Other drivers stare at Neal Smither's truck and sometimes take pictures. On the sides and back of it, in big red letters, is the company name-- "Crime Scene Cleaners, specializing in homicides, suicides, and accidental deaths."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:35.92" data-timestamp="515.92"> Well, this is Nancy Updike, and this is act two of our show-- Act Two, Grime Scene. Nancy went to the San Francisco Bay area to see Neal Smither, who cleans up crime scenes for a living. A quick warning-- some of this might not be suitable for younger listeners, the squeamish, and wussies.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:08:53.28" data-timestamp="533.28"> After spending two days with Neal Smither, I was this close to signing up to open his Los Angeles franchise. I'm not joking. Neal spends all day, every day, speeding around in a huge white pickup truck with a cell phone glued to his ear, making sure his company gets to dispose of every drop of blood within driving distance of Orinda, California, and his franchises in Utah, Kansas, Texas, Las Vegas, and Alabama.</p><p begin="00:09:20.55" data-timestamp="560.55">Mostly, he doesn't leave the truck. He's had this one for about a year, and it's got 90,000 miles on it. Neal is absolutely blunt about his job, to the point of crassness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neal Smither</h4><p begin="00:09:32.61" data-timestamp="572.61"> I did a job one time. An old guy dropped dead, decomposed on his kitchen floor. So when we got there, we had about a 10-by-5-foot square pool of just gore-- no power in the house, so it's dark. It's very quiet. I'm in there with a respirator because it was just humming. It smelled.</p><p begin="00:09:51.21" data-timestamp="591.21">I'm hearing this noise, and I shouldn't be hearing the noise. There's no power in this house, nothing. I got a flashlight. I'm hearing this funky noise, man. What the [BLEEP] is that?</p><p begin="00:10:01.11" data-timestamp="601.11">So I get closer to the gore with my light, and it's just a bowling ball-size thing of maggots, and they're writhing around in the blood and the gore. And it sounds like when you knead hamburger.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:11.37" data-timestamp="611.37"> The maggots were making a sound that you could hear?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neal Smither</h4><p begin="00:10:13.35" data-timestamp="613.35"> There were so many of them, just so many of them writhing around in this pool of gore that yeah, you could hear them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:21.55" data-timestamp="621.55"> The only time he speaks gently about what he does is on sales calls.</p><p begin="00:10:25.87" data-timestamp="625.87">[PHONE RINGS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:27.33" data-timestamp="627.33"> Hi there, this is Neal.

He's 5'5" with short brown hair under a baseball cap and sunglasses. He smokes Kools, does not stop for lunch, and drives way too fast. The directness, the crassness, is all deliberate. It's his marketing strategy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neal Smither</h4><p begin="00:11:35.58" data-timestamp="695.58"> Gore sells. Look at the truck. We're pretty up front.

And I want to stop here and acknowledge that this is gross. It is. It's gross. But it's interesting. And to me, it's much more interesting than it is gross. I mean, think of it-- a melted person.</p><p begin="00:12:18.26" data-timestamp="738.26">Four years ago, Neal had never seen a dead body. He was a laid-off mortgage broker, for God's sake. Then he saw <i>Pulp</i> <i>Fiction.</i> Remember that scene where John Travolta blows the guy's head off in the back of the car by mistake, and they have to call in Mr. Wolf to fix everything?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mr. Wolf</h4><p begin="00:12:33.74" data-timestamp="753.74"> Good.

Get it out of there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:12:44.99" data-timestamp="764.99"> Neal is possibly the only person in America who saw that scene and thought, wow, I want that job. And it turns out it is a real job. If someone dies in your house, it's up to you to get it clean.</p><p begin="00:12:58.01" data-timestamp="778.01">But doing it yourself, even if you wanted to, raises all sorts of problems. Are you complying with the state and federal laws governing the disposal of bodies and bodily fluids? Do you have the proper permits and liability coverage? No, you don't. So you call Neal.</p><p begin="00:13:15.77" data-timestamp="795.77">Here's how his job breaks down. Murders are the least of his business. Most of the cleanups are either decomps-- bodies that have sat for a while and started to decompose--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neal Smither</h4><p begin="00:13:25.44" data-timestamp="805.44"> I did a decomp on the very end unit upstairs there.

He was all humming-- maggots everywhere. It was a typical decomp.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:35.90" data-timestamp="815.9"> --or suicides. Suicides and attempted suicides are a surprisingly big part of his job. The rest of Neal's business consists of meth labs and kitty houses. Kitty houses are those places, usually full of old newspapers and other garbage, that have dozens of cats everywhere, eating and peeing and crapping.</p><p begin="00:13:57.71" data-timestamp="837.71">Meth labs are usually hotel accounts. Neal has a few national chains on contract. Hotel rooms get used all the time to cook methamphetamine, Neal says. He does a lot of business with hotels. He claims, hyperbolically, that there's no hotel in the country that hasn't had a murder or suicide in one of its rooms.</p><p begin="00:14:20.17" data-timestamp="860.17">The second day I spend with Neal, he gets called out to a jail to clean up after a woman who tried to kill herself in the bathroom off the prisoners' waiting room. I'm not allowed to record anything. I have to just watch.</p><p begin="00:14:32.77" data-timestamp="872.77">I hold open the bathroom door with my foot while Neal sets up his stuff. Next to the sink are several thick, dark red drops of blood. And there are a few streaks of blood on the wall. Inside the sink is more blood. It isn't a lot, maybe 1/3 of a cup overall. But clearly, she did some damage.</p><p begin="00:14:51.61" data-timestamp="891.61">Then, while Neal is getting into his protective suit, a woman in the waiting room behind us-- a tweaker, Neal confided to me later, meaning a meth user-- reads the back of Neal's shirt out loud. "Crime scene cleaners," she says. "You cleaned my mother's house."</p><p begin="00:15:09.35" data-timestamp="909.35">Neal turns around. "Yeah? Which one was that?"</p><p begin="00:15:14.39" data-timestamp="914.39">Without any emotion, the woman says her mother and cousin were murdered by her mother's boyfriend a while ago. "You guys cleaned the house," she repeats.</p><p begin="00:15:24.62" data-timestamp="924.62">"Oh, yeah, I remember that one. That was on the news," Neal says.</p><p begin="00:15:30.62" data-timestamp="930.62">The woman nods and doesn't say anything. So Neal goes back to cleaning. He whips through it in about 10 minutes, like it's spilt milk. In fact, it's exactly like cleaning up a mess at home, except with industrial-strength cleansers and equipment. He snaps on some rubber gloves, sprays the whole area with a special enzyme to neutralize the blood and kill any bacteria or viruses, scrubs any tough spots with a little brush, and then wipes everything clean with heavy-duty paper towels. It isn't hard, just depressing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neal Smither</h4><p begin="00:16:12.32" data-timestamp="972.32"> Bottom line, I'm a businessman. I'm an entrepreneur.

And she'd kick me down with lunch tickets for a discounted price, and then I'd sell them for an increased price. But it was still lower than what the Mexican kids or whoever could buy them from the school. So I figure I beat the school by $0.20 a ticket.</p><p begin="00:16:54.88" data-timestamp="1014.88">[BLEEP], I bankrolled my whole high school career on Blow Pops and lunch tickets.

But in the meantime, the job is changing him. Seeing so many crime scenes, seeing the way so many people die, he's also seen how they live-- in houses filled with old newspapers, dirty dishes, and too many cats, never cleaning the bathroom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Neal Smither</h4><p begin="00:17:39.66" data-timestamp="1059.66"> I think more than anything now, most people are just dirty mother-[BLEEP].

He doesn't want to be found by a company like his and cleaned up, with his family off somewhere wondering what happened.</p><p begin="00:19:42.91" data-timestamp="1182.91">He doesn't even care if it's a painful death, he says, as long as it's slow.

<h3>Act Three: A Criminal Returns To The Scene Of The Crime</h3>
<div class="act-inner">
<div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:47.49" data-timestamp="1247.49"> It's <i>This</i> American <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week, of course, we choose some theme, bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program-- crime scenes and the stories they tell. We've arrived at Act Three of our show. Act Three, Return to the Scene of the Crime.</p><p begin="00:21:02.36" data-timestamp="1262.36">There's a truism in detective fiction that a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. But it turns out, in real life, that actually is not very common, except maybe among arsonists. Arsonists like to see the fires they've set, apparently, and some of them are caught when police look at pictures taken of the crowd at various fires.</p><p begin="00:21:19.90" data-timestamp="1279.9">And then-- maybe it's very rare, maybe not. Nobody really tracks this kind of thing. There are the people who circle back to the scene of their crimes to undo, to erase something, or at least to promise it'll never happen again. Katie Davis discovered that one of her own neighbors in Washington, DC, an old friend, was trying to do just that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:21:36.99" data-timestamp="1296.99"> Bobby comes up my street one afternoon in March. I haven't seen him in a few months. And he's kind of gliding along, smoking a Marlboro. That's the way he's carried himself since sixth grade, when I first met him-- one of the bad boys from over on Calvert Street.</p><p begin="00:21:51.93" data-timestamp="1311.93">Bobby tells me he's going to coach a Little League team with some neighborhood kids. "Great," I say from up on my porch. Inside, I'm thinking, "Who's he kidding? He's rail-thin. He's sweating. It looks like he's been using all winter."</p><p begin="00:22:05.79" data-timestamp="1325.79">Bobby flicks his burning cigarette into the street and watches me, waiting for more reaction. This is the same Bobby I loved and tried to save for a whole year, Bobby who stole $60 from my house to buy heroin and swore to God, swore to his own dead daughter, that my dog Purdy ate the money. And this is his latest plan to get clean, coaching a bunch of 10, 11, and 12-year-olds, rounded up by the DC Department of Recreation. All I can say is, "That's great."</p><p begin="00:22:39.86" data-timestamp="1359.86">A week later, Bobby's back, this time on my machine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:43.84" data-timestamp="1363.84"> You have two messages.

Maybe we'll run up and see if we can say hi to you. Katie, you've got to see this. These thugs I got are unbelievable. One of them tried to spit on me yesterday at practice. A couple of them, I don't think even I can handle.

I was a little afraid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:23:54.29" data-timestamp="1434.29"> OK, he was picking who was going to be right field or whatever. But then, everybody was just yelling at each other and jonesing on each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:24:05.57" data-timestamp="1445.57"> I was trying to get them to chill and relax and play ball, focus on the game.

One kid spit at me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:24:19.22" data-timestamp="1459.22"> And he got mad and said practice was over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:24:23.93" data-timestamp="1463.93"> And I cursed them and I told them they didn't [BLEEP] impress me. Before they were born, I was in penitentiary. So if they're trying to act like they're bad, they're not impressing me.</p><p begin="00:24:39.92" data-timestamp="1479.92">And right when I did that, I felt in my gut that I had just screwed up. I felt right then that, you know what? You just laid all of your cards on the table. You don't have a hole card anymore. Now they know you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:24:55.43" data-timestamp="1495.43"> Then Shannon said, maybe he got pumped in the butt by lots of men.

I don't know what his home life is like. But from what I can see, he's emotional. And when he feels cheated or done wrong, he reacts exactly like I always reacted-- violently, verbally with the violence. And he just goes off, [BLEEP] you and [BLEEP] the team.</p><p begin="00:28:30.07" data-timestamp="1710.07">And well, that's me. That was me, and in ways, it still is. When I get my feelings hurt, I don't always say, "Well, you really hurt my feelings." I say, "[BLEEP] you, mother-[BLEEP]."</p><p begin="00:28:50.11" data-timestamp="1730.11">And you know what I do? What I've done for a lot of years is I would hurt myself because someone hurt me. Well, Benjamin does that at practice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:29:01.18" data-timestamp="1741.18"> No, man, he's always getting on somebody's nerves. [BLEEP] Getting on everybody's nerves.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:29:06.91" data-timestamp="1746.91"> Bobby finally asked Benjamin to go home and come back next practice. Instead, Benjamin stands over my microphone and starts calling the game as he sees it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamin</h4><p begin="00:29:16.66" data-timestamp="1756.66"> He thinks he's right all the time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:29:18.33" data-timestamp="1758.33"> Who are you talking about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Benjamin</h4><p begin="00:29:20.14" data-timestamp="1760.14"> The coach.

Man, bump all that, man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:29:29.08" data-timestamp="1769.08"> Bobby pauses as Benjamin mimics him, then throws the ball up and cracks it to the outfield.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:29:33.80" data-timestamp="1773.8"> Bring it home, fellas. Bring it home.</p><p begin="00:29:35.62" data-timestamp="1775.62">[BAT PINGS]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:29:36.34" data-timestamp="1776.34"> A few minutes later, Benjamin finally does a lap, but he walks it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:29:40.80" data-timestamp="1780.8"> Watch the hop. You still got him. Good throw now, Monty. Thank you. Thank you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:29:47.88" data-timestamp="1787.88"> When he was these kids' ages, Bobby ran wild at night, taking money, stealing bikes. Most kids were afraid of him, but he never messed with me and my brothers. I even remember Bobby and his sister eating with us a couple of times because his mom never made dinner.</p><p begin="00:30:03.62" data-timestamp="1803.62">When Bobby was 13, his mother caught him stealing change out of her purse and kicked him out of the house. The only place Bobby knew to go was right here to this field, where he now coaches baseball.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:30:15.03" data-timestamp="1815.03"> You got one more shot at it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:30:16.16" data-timestamp="1816.16"> It used to be an abandoned lot full of old cars and refrigerators. Here in the left outfield-- where Joey's pacing and muttering because Bobby told him to quit looking for a fight-- right here, there used to be a white '69 Ford Falcon. That's where Bobby went when his mother threw him out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:30:34.05" data-timestamp="1834.05"> I spray painted all the windows black so no one could see in, and I would shoplift food from the corner store, Matty's Delicatessen, neighborhood deli-- stuff like Vienna sausages and a bottle of wine and go to sleep with at night and sardines. And that was dinner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:30:54.19" data-timestamp="1854.19"> Bobby says that alcohol helped him feel less afraid late at night in that old Ford. Soon, he found pot, then PCP. In his 20s, he started shooting heroin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:31:06.24" data-timestamp="1866.24"> Sorry, that little big-headed little kid, like a whole bunch of little leprechauns running around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:31:12.06" data-timestamp="1872.06"> Trash is talked at every practice, and Bobby is teased relentlessly for wearing Payless shoes, which the kids would never be caught dead in. Brandon, the eight-year-old, calls Bobby powdered doughnut because he's white. And he likes to lean into Bobby and whisper, "Punk."</p><p begin="00:31:29.61" data-timestamp="1889.61">Mostly, Bobby laughs. Other times, though, especially when the kids start in on each other, it can get to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:31:36.03" data-timestamp="1896.03"> Fellas, fellas, I can't talk if you're talking.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 1</h4><p begin="00:31:41.27" data-timestamp="1901.27"> Coach, you need some more gloves, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:31:43.20" data-timestamp="1903.2"> I'm about ready to put the gloves in the bag and go home.

No, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:31:50.01" data-timestamp="1910.01"> I'm serious, boys. Shut up. Everybody shut up, please.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:31:53.10" data-timestamp="1913.1"> Bobby picks up the bat bag and slams it against a brick wall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:31:57.86" data-timestamp="1917.86"> Chill, OK? Chill. I can't talk if you're all talking. OK, look here. I'm sorry--</p><p begin="00:32:05.84" data-timestamp="1925.84">What's up, fellas? What's happening?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:32:08.78" data-timestamp="1928.78"> Somewhere around the third or fourth practice, without announcing it in any way, the boys start calling Bobby "Coach." "Coach, can you fix this glove? Coach, which bat should I use?"</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:32:19.43" data-timestamp="1939.43"> What's it like when the kids call you Coach?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:32:23.93" data-timestamp="1943.93"> You know, it didn't really hit me at first, you know? I took them to a picnic a couple of weekends ago that some recovering alcoholic and addict friends of mine threw. And to hear people there-- "hey, Bobby, hey, Bobby"-- and then to hear this group of kids that I came with-- "hey, Coach, hey, Coach"-- that's when it sort of hit me that, hey, man, that's just who you are.</p><p begin="00:32:58.47" data-timestamp="1978.47">And these people now see me as Coach, not just Bobby the recovering dope fiend, you know? He's Coach. So that makes me feel good to have these kids call me Coach.</p><p begin="00:33:17.58" data-timestamp="1997.58">So I don't know. Now I have this little small part in shaping what their day is going to be like, you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:33:28.02" data-timestamp="2008.02"> When he told me that he had come from prison and he got shot in his neck, I thought he was just another one of them people who like to talk about their life and then get over it. But I learned to understand him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:33:45.51" data-timestamp="2025.51"> How do you understand him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:33:48.48" data-timestamp="2028.48"> He don't want no trouble. He just wants us to listen to him. But I guess as you grow into people, you start to have more patience.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:34:05.46" data-timestamp="2045.46"> As you roll into people?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:34:06.81" data-timestamp="2046.81"> Grow. You start to have more patience. And I think that's what's happening.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:34:15.49" data-timestamp="2055.49"> The Department of Recreation gives Bobby an ID badge, which he wears around his neck when he comes down to the neighborhood, like a sign-- I am no longer a dope fiend. I'm doing something good. Most people might keep it in their pocket. Bobby wears it right on his chest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:34:30.75" data-timestamp="2070.75"> I just walk around with my head high and feeling proud, for the most part, very proud of what I'm doing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:34:41.82" data-timestamp="2081.82"> The skeptics are everywhere, though-- neighbors who gave him advances for paint jobs he never did, people he stole bank cards from, people he actually spit on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:34:51.59" data-timestamp="2091.59"> What is that like for you to walk around in the neighborhood, and you might even walk by somebody that you owe money to or conned money out of?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:35:02.88" data-timestamp="2102.88"> It's hard to explain, really. It's a roller coaster of emotions. There's times-- and right when I'm feeling like the world is wonderful, when everything is going my way, I'll see someone that I had conned out of a few hundred bucks. And the voice in my head will immediately say, "See there? You're still a scumbag. Remember when-- look, that's who you really are."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:35:39.04" data-timestamp="2139.04"> So what do you do when you see that person?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:35:41.99" data-timestamp="2141.99"> It depends. It depends on how I feel. And there's times when I might be feeling real insecure and I'll put that macho thing up. And I'll put the cocky thing up and hope they say something wrong to me so that I can go south with them, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:36:01.69" data-timestamp="2161.69"> Do you do that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:36:03.16" data-timestamp="2163.16"> No, but I want to. I want to. I mean, there's a part of me that still wants to be a thug. There's a part of me still very capable of being a thug. I just wouldn't be able to be a real good thug with my hands because I'm older. I'd have to get a weapon now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:36:27.01" data-timestamp="2187.01"> I ain't wearing no girly thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:36:29.56" data-timestamp="2189.56"> It's early May. And after 10 practices, the kids are finally stepping into their uniforms at the local recreation center. This is the first new thing they've seen all season. Their bats and gloves are splintered and old. But the uniforms are bright blue and gray, Texas Ranger uniforms with red caps.</p><p begin="00:36:47.68" data-timestamp="2207.68">Bobby is tanned and relaxed, dancing around, faking jabs, counting the kids to see if he can field a team-- never a sure thing. Today, they're exactly nine boys, the day of their first game against another team.</p><p begin="00:37:07.96" data-timestamp="2227.96">The recreation bus is an hour late to take the team to their game, so some of us go on a taxi, six kids and I all squished together. Bobby and the others are hailing a cab when the bus finally shows up. We all pile out at what is supposedly the best Little League field in the city. The grass is shin-high. There's a pile of dirt in the outfield. No fans, no parents-- just Bobby and the team.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 1</h4><p begin="00:37:30.97" data-timestamp="2250.97"> That means I have a feel, I can slap him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 2</h4><p begin="00:37:34.31" data-timestamp="2254.31"> Hey, what time is it?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:37:38.95" data-timestamp="2258.95"> About 5:06.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 2</h4><p begin="00:37:40.24" data-timestamp="2260.24"> Dang, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 3</h4><p begin="00:37:43.73" data-timestamp="2263.73"> Oh, the other team forfeited.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:37:46.29" data-timestamp="2266.29"> The other team never shows, so Bobby's team wins by default. Some other kids are in the same boat, so there's an impromptu scrimmage. And official or not, this is the first baseball game that most of these kids have ever played.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 1</h4><p begin="00:37:59.34" data-timestamp="2279.34"> It's too damn small, man. We would tear them up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy 2</h4><p begin="00:38:03.16" data-timestamp="2283.16"> Uh-huh, OK, what's up, shut up, uh-huh, OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:38:07.47" data-timestamp="2287.47"> The other team is small but very fast, and they have three coaches who tell them when to steal bases. So a line drive becomes a run, then another run, and another run. And it's 5-0.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:38:19.57" data-timestamp="2299.57"> He stole home on y'all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Coach</h4><p begin="00:38:21.09" data-timestamp="2301.09"> Good play, good play, Carlos.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:38:24.04" data-timestamp="2304.04"> So we'll see what we need to work on today instead of looking good in our uniforms. Come on, let's get an out. We've got to force to second. Get the force to second.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:38:34.95" data-timestamp="2314.95"> The season lurches forward with DC Recreation canceling games for no reason, never rescheduling rainouts. The uniforms are not washed for three weeks. And one day, no one shows up to let the boys in to suit up for a game, so they have to forfeit. By June, Bobby's team has only played one real game-- one game in four months.</p><p begin="00:38:56.25" data-timestamp="2336.25">In this inconsistent world, Bobby is someone the kids can count on. He never misses practice, coming in his painter's pants most days to hit the ball to them. And while it might seem like Bobby's keeping the kids in line, he'll tell you that's what they're doing for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:39:11.76" data-timestamp="2351.76"> I don't want to have to avoid my neighborhood. I don't want to have to avoid my community playground because I let these kids down because I'm a drunken dope fiend [BLEEP] bum, which is what I become if I go have a beer right now or some dope right now. Tomorrow, I'm a bum because all the good feelings are gone.</p><p begin="00:39:33.99" data-timestamp="2373.99">I don't want to feel the shame which I felt from relapses. And it's big-time shame. It's shame. I won't be able to look these kids in their eyes, in their faces. I'll duck them. God, I'm 42 years old, and I would have to come to my own neighborhood and duck children because I'm ashamed. I don't want that.</p><p begin="00:40:02.54" data-timestamp="2402.54">Throw that smoke. Throw that smoke. Throw that smoke. You're the man out there. You're the man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:40:09.47" data-timestamp="2409.47"> By June, Bobby's team gets its first win with some great pitching from Donald and a catch by Ricardo in the third inning that looks more like a football interception.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:40:20.42" data-timestamp="2420.42"> Woo-hoo! Yeah! Oh, man. Boy, that was a major-league catch, man. I don't make catches like that. Woo-hoo!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:40:33.68" data-timestamp="2433.68"> And while they wait for their bus to take them back home, the boys start tussling with each other, rolling around on a grassy hill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:40:41.42" data-timestamp="2441.42"> They're celebrating their win.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:40:42.71" data-timestamp="2442.71"> They are celebrating their win by wrestling. I'm about to myself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:40:48.54" data-timestamp="2448.54"> This is easily the sweetest moment of the season, not only because of the win, but because it's amazing to see the boys so happy. And this is what Bobby will remember when Justin and Ricardo get in a real fight an hour later, when he has to suspend Benjamin not once, but twice, and when Joey threatens to beat up a kid from another team. Always that delicate balance-- fragile, like sobriety.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:41:14.09" data-timestamp="2474.09"> Time out, time out. I got to tie my shoe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bobby</h4><p begin="00:41:17.76" data-timestamp="2477.76"> I always thought I was going to be a loser forever. First of all, being clean makes me feel like, OK, I've got a chance to be a winner. But the kids, especially-- it's something about kids, you know? This is something I never thought, man, that I'd be able to do.</p><p begin="00:41:40.08" data-timestamp="2500.08">When I was walking after a practice, like, a week or two ago, I swear to God, I walked across Duke Ellington Bridge to the subway, and I started crying. I started crying because I was so [BLEEP] happy-- so happy that, damn, this is probably going to work out. I'm probably going to be able to pull this off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Katie Davis</h4><p begin="00:42:06.71" data-timestamp="2526.71"> By the end of the season, the kids have a record of two wins and no losses. Playoffs never get scheduled, so there's no reason to practice anymore. No one knows where Benjamin is these days. And just this week, I saw Joey stealing a soda from the corner store, and I made him take it back.</p><p begin="00:42:24.20" data-timestamp="2544.2">Bobby still comes around, though, and hangs out in the park, talks with the boys. And he sometimes shoots one-on-one with them. And he says, "Stick with me. I'm going to have tryouts for 12-and-under basketball team. I'm going to still be coming around here."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:42:39.88" data-timestamp="2559.88"> Oh, you're going to get it now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:47.39" data-timestamp="2567.39"> Katie Davis throws that smoke in the neighborhood she grew up in, in Washington, DC.</p><p begin="00:42:51.73" data-timestamp="2571.73">[MUSIC - RAY CHARLES, "GET ON THE RIGHT TRACK"]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Charles</h4><p begin="00:42:53.12" data-timestamp="2573.12"> (SINGING) Get on the right track, baby.
